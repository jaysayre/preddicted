daniellelasvegas,119,386,1r28l6,1290,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.





Edit: words",Almost push me onto the tracks? Good luck grabbing your desired seat.,1676
neenerneenerboo,69,490,1qw75b,1255,"Sorry this is long. But oh so sweet. 


This guy that went to my high school, Jimmy, was the absolute worst. He was the typical asshole jock—everyone let him get away with shit. But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes. I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way, so he thought we were even friends. 


My main beef with him was the way he treated girls. Though Jimmy wasn’t very attractive, he coasted on popularity, and our school was very small with more girls than boys. He mostly preyed on underclassmen (my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy) but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be, so I witnessed over and over again as he’d suck in one of my friends, who would be convinced that he’s changed for her and being genuinely nice this time, and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested. 


He dated one of my friends, Jane, who is the sweetest person in the world. She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break. Telling her she’s gaining weight, flirting with other girls in front of her, general toying of her emotions. You could tell she was super stressed out, and finally she broke up with him. Wahoo! 


But it didn’t end there. We had assigned seats in computer class, and I sat between Jimmy and Jane’s sister, Beth, who is equally sweet. On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends (close to Mr. Teacher’s desk so he could try to keep them in check) where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were. Right after the breakup, Jimmy talked about how he’s over it and already has “a few public school sluts lined up,” (lols, private school life—this was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you “met on vacation so she lives in a different city”) and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane, and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth, who was not a confrontational person. 


I plotted. Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence. Since he was put in the spotlight so often, it was easy to see that while he could get an A+ at getting girls to send him nudes, he struggled academically. So, I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else. I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer, pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pull-out keyboard (there was a lot of hidden room, they sat just out of view above my own keyboard.) 


Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual, but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment, he just could not get it right. This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password. He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr. Teacher, who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmy’s information just fine. “Maybe you had your password wrong?” he says, but Jimmy is insistent that he isn’t that stupid and something is wrong with the computer. 


I tormented Jimmy for weeks, pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes. He would put his mouse icon over a button, and then I’d slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it, infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something. Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible. His documents were full of typos. He would type a word, and I would just press one letter to throw him off, and then he’d try again, only for the same thing to happen. Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead, but right-clicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention. Open the task manager while he’s in a program. He’d look away, and I’d close a window or document, or just press backspace until he turned around. I was careful to be pretty inconsistent—when other people were looking, I’d back off to make him look crazy. Whatever he’d been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over. My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard. 


I started to punish him this way. Wandering eye? Wandering mouse while he’s trying to play a game. Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman? Oh look, his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged. Ignore new girlfriend because it’s funny? Unexpected shutdown, because losing unsaved work is funnier. One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy, and I put a number at the end of his new password, and the same thing when he confirmed the password. This new password then didn’t work, and he couldn’t reset it again without knowing the current password. Jimmy was going nuts, but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didn’t know how to use a computer. He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer. His assignments took longer, so he had less time to horse around with his friends. People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class, and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything. 


One time, when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didn’t even have his hands on anything, I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen. His eyes widen and he shouts, “Look!” interrupting Mr. Teacher’s lecture. I stop. “It was doing it! My mouse was moving and I wasn’t even doing anything!” We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmy’s delusions as he keeps yelling, myself and Beth included, although we were laughing on the inside, giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmy’s meltdown. 


“That’s it,” Mr. Teacher said, worn thin over Jimmy’s incompetence. “No one else is having problems with that computer. You’re just not compatible, I guess. Move to that one.” He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students, which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers. 


Jimmy protests, suggesting Mr. Teacher “just fix it,” but at this point, Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too. We weren’t bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class. But to my surprise, Jimmy still had problems. Almost all the stuff I was doing. He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks, but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers. One day alone in the computer room, I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr. Teacher comes in. He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse, which wiggled around on Jimmy’s screen. 


“Wifi,” he explained. 


Turned out, Mr. Teacher knew what I was doing all along. He hated dealing with Jimmy too, and distracting him meant less class disruption. But after his meltdown, Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his far-away friends. 


Tl;dr: Guy is a douche to my friend, plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him. He goes crazy and everyone talks about it. 

Edit for more info: We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere, our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach, and he was Jimmy's track coach, so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class, they joked around a lot. At our school, the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal. He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough. He was just a few years out of college, and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruption.

Jimmy really actually was bad with computers. At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black. He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer. I know that using Bluetooth doesn't always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school, so perhaps that's what the teacher meant--I am really not that great with that stuff myself. Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts.

teuker,158,401,1r5efr,997,"Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field. Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

""Firstname (she LOATHED being called anything except Dr. Lastname),

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

My biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that, so I swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers. She got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing. Even if I had got caught, the ensuing meltdown was well worth it. 

I started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so I told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work.

FredFltStn,109,249,1qz5am,693,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

compuhyperglobalmega,58,150,1qzcpe,697,"Was sitting in massive surface street commuter traffic.  This was 6-lane road near several shopping centers and multiple intersections jammed with cars, very slow going.  My goal was in sight, however.  If I could just make it through the next light, I could hit the freeway onramp and get out of here.  As luck would have it, the light turned red just as the car in front of me crawled through the intersection.  Stuck for another 5 minutes.  My own irritation was interrupted by a loud honk from behind, and I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a middle-aged woman in a lifted Ford F250 gesturing wildly at me, as though I cost her the light.

I just smiled and prepared to ignore her, until I noticed the red lights of a fire truck and EMT heading our way from behind, trying to make their way through the traffic jam.  There were so many cars with nowhere to go, at one point they were forced to cut through the shopping center parking lot.  

While I’m watching this drama unfold, our light turned green, and F250 lady immediately began honking and waving her arms at me.  What she didn’t notice through her rage (but everybody else on the road did), was just as the light turned green, the EVs had swung into the opposing traffic lanes which had cleared out. It was obvious they were going to hit our intersection and swing back into our lanes which had cleared out ahead of the intersection during the red light.  The only thing I could do was sit tight, keep the intersection clear, and stay out of the way. 

I just kept watching in my rearview as the lady became more and more enraged, and EVs got closer and closer.  She was laying on the horn continuously just as the EVs blew by on the left and swung in front of us and went on their way.

Redsnork,53,127,1r3jsq,596,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

The whole time, she also complained about stupid, lazy cashiers, to her bratty kids who were mixing up all of the candy bars on purpose. This woman looked me straight in the eyes, and said, ""I know these things are hard for people who aren't college educated.""

I could have let it go. But instead, I called up the manager.

""Nonsense!"" I said, in the sweetest voice possible. ""We want your full satisfaction.""

I'm tall and you're bruising my knees"".  His response?  ""Whatever man, I paid for this seat"".  @$$hole mode, engage.

&amp;nbsp;

I make myself comfortable, take the magazines out of the seat pocket, slouch down a bit, and extend my legs to get comfortable to comfortably sleep.  I can now literally feel his spine on my knees.  Great.  I can poke him.  Man I feel a bit uncomfortable... guess I'll have to readjust my position every few minutes.  Does that mean my knees keep digging into his back?  Too bad.  Even when I'm not moving I could feel him trying to find a comfortable position.  I'd quickly move my knees so that by the time he leaned back again my knees had found his spine again.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept it up for at least 2-3 hours, the guy was stubborn as a mule.  He asked me if I could not hit him in the back and my response?  ""Sorry, I paid for the seat, you know?""  The look on his face was so priceless I wish I could have saved it somehow and show it my future grandkids (on the way after I get married and have actual kids as well), just to show them how badly PopPop (would love that as a grandad name) screwed over a douche on a plane.

&amp;nbsp;

He moved his seat back all the way up and didn't say anything for the rest of the flight.  Peace.

n33dyourlov3,37,104,1r13h2,426,"A few months ago I worked as a cleaning lady in a large day care. This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work. After a month of harassment, embarrassment, and belittling, I decided to walk out early-mid shift leaving good ol Nessa to clean the mess all by herself.","Treat me like a dog, I quit half way through my shift!!",530
k-squid,32,103,1qytdq,404,"My first job was in a bowling alley/arcade. I originally worked at the prize counter, and then switched over to the food court. They're not the best stories of revenge, but they felt pretty good for 16 year old me.

The first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker. During my first week, he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees. If I had a problem and went to ask him for help, he would refuse to move if I didn't have every minute detail, leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer. There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock, something I had been told was a fire-able offense. He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed. When introducing me to other employees or regulars, he would always say, ""That's k-squid, the lesbian,"" because I had a short hair cut. He also would refer to me as ""retard"" or call anything I liked ""retarded"".

You may be wondering whether or not I went to management. I did. Multiple times. I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing, but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like, ""Yep, that's Prick for you!"" I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts, but there were none available. I was stuck working with Prick all the time.

Eventually, we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school. In May of his senior year. No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED. 

Wat. 

On this particular night, some of Prick's friends had come in to say hi and play games, and Prick started making fun of everything about me, his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense. Finally, Prick says, ""K-squid, you're such a fucking retard."" Without skipping a beat, I replied, ""Yeah? I may be a retard, but at least I won't have to work here for the rest of my fucking life."" He stared at me, slack jawed, while his friends were rolling with laughter. He never called me retarded again.

The second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick, and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice. A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at, and it seemed definite that I would be hired. (I was, in the end.)

Being that the bowling alley was my first job ever, I was a total ~~model employee~~ suck up. I'd be there early every day, stay late, do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question, and took shifts for people whenever they asked. After switching to the food court, it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from 2pm-10m, and then come to me at 7pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close, at 2am. I did this without complaint, and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under 18 working past midnight.

I had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance. I was promised that I would have it off with no issue. Lo and behold, I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday. I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend, so I would just have to work. I went to the GM, who told me there was nothing he could do. I had to find someone to cover both shifts. Of course, not a single person was willing to take my shifts. Even though I'd taken at least 3 shifts for each of them. I went back to the GM who told me, ""It's not my problem. I don't care.""

Defeated, I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled. I was so sick of being treated like complete shit, of being talked down to and taken advantage of. It was then that I decided my revenge. 

Cue to Saturday afternoon, 1:58 pm. I'm sitting comfortably in my PJs at home. The bowling alley, arcade, and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy. I called the food court and said I wouldn't be coming in. I'd quit. The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line. ""You can't quit now! It's the busiest night of the week! [Male coworker] is the only one we've got! [Food Court Manager] is out of town, and I know you couldn't find anyone else to work for you! What do you expect us to do?!"" I took a breath, steadied my voice and said, ""It's not my problem. I don't care, "" then hung up.",Two stories of Petty Revenge from my first job.,507
Rhipidurafulginosa,60,160,1r77bf,402,"My Mum's a 70 year old pensioner.  She grows vegetables hydroponically, harvests and packs them and on Mondays she fills her van with crates of vegetables and delivers them to local restaurants and lunchbars.  She runs a good part-time business and makes a tidy part-time profit.

So last Monday, she's at a busy intersection in town.  The lights are green, so off she goes, but the vehicles at the other side of the lights aren't moving.  She's trapped in her van in the middle of the intersection as the lights change again and she's blocking traffic.

It's completely her own fault.  She screwed up.  She should have checked ahead and made sure the way was clear.  She knows this.  How embarrassing.  She has to sit there cringing in the middle of the intersection waiting for the way to be clear so she can move.

There's a man standing on the side of the road with his lovely wife.  He's outraged! ""STUPID BITCH!"" he yells.  His wife looks at him a little surprised.

My Mum the pensioner knows she screwed up.  There is currently nothing she can do to rectify the situation other than wait it out.  It's pretty embarrassing.

So she turns at looks at the outraged man and takes a big deep breath.  ""CUNT!"" she yells.

Man's wife looks startled, then starts giggling.  Man is apoplectic!  His eyebrows are going in all directions!  ""SHITHEAD!"" he yells.

Trishlovesdolphins,23,90,1qxa3e,373,"A couple of weeks ago, I went to Petco. I was actually having a great time, my mom kept my kids for the afternoon so I could do a few errands and I was happily petting the cats up for adoption when I started hearing a tantrum. 

I look over, there is a kid, about 8-9 who is throwing a screaming fit because he wanted some dog toy. This continues through out the whole store. Kid sees hamsters, can't have one, 5 minute tantrum. Kid sees turtles... you get the idea. 

I'm a little miffed that my nice quiet errand has been blasted by a brat. My 4 year old doesn't behave like that in the store, WTF is a 8-9 year old doing it for? My luck, I get behind them in the checkout line. 

This particular Petco has a bar full of self serve treats. They all look like cookies, and some smell really good. Bratty kid asks his dad for cookies. The dad says no. I watch as this kid shoves 3 or 4 of the cookies in his mouth when his dad wasn't looking. 

Now, I *COULD* have said, ""sir, I just saw your son put dog biscuits in his mouth..."" But I didn't. I waited until that little shit had chewed them up, really good. Just as he was about to swallow them I pipe up, ""Excuse me, I think your kid just ate a dog treat."" 

Kid spits it out yelling about how he was eating dog food. He's scraping his tongue, begging for some water. Of course, there is no water for sale in the store so he had to wait to rinse his mouth out... 

Enjoy your dog breath fucker.

YesYouCannot,103,123,1r7zub,419,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

lessthanthreesquared,23,70,1qzcxw,284,"A friend and I were traveling together, but had been assigned an aisle and window seat. We were hoping no one would be seated between us, but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left. My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seat—he said, ""sure!"" and started to get up, but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats, he refused politely and sat back down. Weird, but no big deal. We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments, so this guy's own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed us.

Generally, I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway: full reign of the armrest, keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum (air, lights, etc). He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area, and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones, but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough, and I figured I'd only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff. I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat, turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to, and settled in. Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff, and I thought it would be the end of that.

Once we were in the air, though, he threw his jacket over himself, spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friend's seat, and both of us kept handing back his sleeves, asking him to be more careful. He'd make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space, but every time he shifted it would happen again. I later found out he had also used my friend's armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels weren't changing, but when he was asked to stop did he apologize? Of course not. He was just generally a clueless idiot.

Here's the thing: clueless idiot thing aside, he *really wasn't that bad.* Until...

My personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably, and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air. He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window, so once I caught on to that, I shut it for the rest of the flight ""so I could sleep."" Thing is, I like to see the lights in the city when we land, so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend: I knew he would enjoy the show, but I, too, wanted to see the lights, and I felt an opportunity for petty revenge.

So I opened the window, and he jumped into action, craning his neck, moving his elbows into my space, trying to see better. So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best ""Wow, this is AMAZING"" face at my friend. Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us, but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing strip—too late. I leaned back in my seat, affecting his view of the other window, and shut my own window pointedly.

When we got off the plane, we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky, and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways. I could only grin.

The cart comes further, and she's actually pushing the damn thing into me. I sigh loudly, in an attempt to point out, umm, I'm standing here. YOU CAN WAIT THIRTY GODDAMNED SECONDS TO PUSH YOUR CART HERE.

Nope. Nothing. She knows what she's doing. She just looks at me in that, ""I know what I'm doing but I also know you won't do anything about it"" look. I don't know what the fuck her problem is.

Two weekends ago, the coin machine was busier than usual - always at least one or two people waiting to use it.

wellingtonbear,27,48,1qzeqs,209,"I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at Officemax.

I worked the furniture department, and on all the desks, chairs, etc, I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department.  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didn't want the number of tags to match the actual inventory (we could order an item if we were out of stock) and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk.   I'd print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didn't actually buy.

So one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store.  Yelling, screaming, picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines, taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor, etc.  Just being a general terror, and the parents just completely ignoring her.

A different customer came in and bought a desk, so I went to the back and found the item, loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them.   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center, and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door.  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it, they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture, so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside, and they'd naturally continue to the next door.

I saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open.  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor.  As I was walking to where the switch was, that's when I saw it.. the brat was running out to meet her father, and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department.  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept, she threw them up into the air like confetti.

She ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad.  I was flabbergasted, and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit, sort them out, and find the appropriate desks.  Since the parents obviously didn't give a shit, all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldn't get back in.

Then it happened.  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it, and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register.  She stood up and yelled, ""mommy!"" and darted towards the door, which had just started to close.  With the censor off, it was not stopping as she approached.  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed, pinning it up against the door jamb.  

She immediately tried to fall, but for a good second and a half, the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled, then the door opened because it was obstructed, and dropped her right on her face.

FredFltStn,6,85,1qv0xv,201,"**BACKGROUND:**  This is a story from my Food &amp; Beverage/Retail management days at a large entertainment/theme park company.

**STORY:**  Years ago, my friend and I were both supervisors for a large entertainment/theme park company in Orlando. We both worked evenings (different locations), and would usually hit the bars for a properly chilled adult beverage after work. This was before everyone carried a cell phone, and because of our jobs, we were required to be available by phone anytime if someone needed to reach us. Sadly, they knew to call be bar if it was before closing time.

Eventually, I was moved to the early morning shift. Since my then wife also worked mornings, this was definitely better for us (but I REALLY missed closing down the bars with my buddies). After I started working mornings, my friend started to prank call my house. The calls usually came around 3am, after he had finished work and was enjoying the nightlife. Occasionally, I’d be serenaded by a drunken group still in full swing at the bar. 

After the calls, I’d inevitably have to listen to 20 minutes of bitching about my drunken asshole friends. One day, after receiving three drunken calls the night before, I finally snapped. Before I went to bed, I called one of my employees and told him that once they had closed (usually around midnight), he needed to forward all of the location phones, and I gave him my friends home phone number.

As I understand it, the calls started coming in around 4am, and the phone basically didn’t stop ringing until I removed the call forwarding, about 4 hours later. His wife was not pleased. Amazingly, the drunk dialing stopped that day.

dr_gigglefarts,10,36,1r1mlk,201,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

I worked for the BBC.
I controlled the lighting on a music program ""Top of The Pops"".

They replaced a dance troop with a new lot.

One of them went to school with my girlfriend, now wife, she told me of her bullying and arrogance and how she made her live a bit more miserable than it should have been. A few others also suffered. I went to the same school and never noticed just how bad she was, but being a studious kid and two years older I never hung with that crowd.   

When I got to the studio that changed. The dancer recognized me and thinking I was a audience member and said some thing along the lines of ""Hi there, fancy seeing you here. I'm a performing here you know, I might get you into the green room later, you can collect autographs"" that's not a bad thing to say but it was said with was a certain tone of voice and twist of her lip that irritated and I suppose my wife had primed me to dislike her.
  
When their spot came along I dimmed the spotlight on her, to make sure the camera never paused on her.
I did it the week later too. there wasn't another chance as that dancer was let go. The camera didn't like her.

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect. For the last week, it's been normal to expect  2-3 worksheet packets (overall 5-10 pages) and a quiz almost daily. Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools. Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.


I waited, waited patiently, until the moment was right. The clock ticked on: in 15...10...5 minutes, class would end. It was then that I took my revenge. When she wasn't looking, I ""borrowed"" a pencil from her spare pencil cup.

gtrmu223,32,57,1qrq75,176,"I posted this to tales from retail originally, but they don't want it because I guess unless you're bitching about customers or fellow employees, they don't care. Whatever.


To start, I work for a major retailer that is known for very low prices and treating their employees like crap. You can figure out which one. I started there in the electronics department in June. In September I was transferred to the wireless department due to 3 people leaving from there in a 7 day time frame. This made me happy because it's not as busy up there and I like working with phones. Most of the time though you just get paid to sit around and do nothing. That'll make anyone happy!

Anyway shortly after I was moved up there electronics got a new assistant manager over the department. The person who was above it is still working at the same store, just over a different department. The old one was someone who actually listened to the associates and did what he could to fix their concerns. The new one just sees customers as dollar signs and when she gets a customer complaint, she berates the employee without listening to their side of the story. I had 3 complaints in 2 weeks since she's been there, but not one when the other guy was over the department. Needless to say her and I don't get along.

Now, our department manager used to be a fair person. She left for 2 months because she had blood clots in her legs. Since she's been back, she's been a different person. Very strict, very dictator like. I don't know if it has anything to do with the new assistant manager, but I wouldn't doubt it if it did.

Anyway enough back story. For the last month they've been fucking with my hours. There's usually 3 shifts for wireless in my store: opener, mid shift, and closer. It seems like whenever I'm scheduled for one of these shifts, and there's a second one scheduled, when they come in I always get sent back to electronics. Which is all and fine, but wireless hours are not as long as electronics hours. Not to mention they get mad at me for not completing my work despite the fact that I have to cover the breaks and lunch of whoever is in wireless. Classic case of overworked and underpaid. And let's not forget my hours have gone down to the point where I only have 25 hours a week now. Lucky if I ever see 28, VERY lucky if I ever see 35.

Here's the revenge part: This past Monday I got called by the place I first interviewed at when I moved to where I am now last December. I re applied and they want to interview me again. So I go, and 3 and a half hours after I interview they're offering me the job, which I immediately accept. The biggest reason? True full time hours (40 hours, not the retarded retail definition of full time), benefits, every Sunday off with another day during the week. I would've been an idiot not to accept it.

So I walked into my current work on Wednesday and gave them my notice, which was a satisfying feeling itself. What was even more satisfying was when the manager asked what my last day would be when I was putting my notice in writing. You should've seen the look on his face when I told him it would be the day before Thanksgiving. That is my ultimate revenge to them. You treat me like shit and screw me over? I will screw you right back.

While they're all forced to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday, I'll be enjoying dinner with my girlfriend's family and have a nice long weekend to rest and prepare for my new job on December 2nd.
Score one for the little guy!

TL;DR: My work fucks me over on hours. I retaliate by getting a full time job and making my last day the day before Thanksgiving so I don't have to work that day and Black Friday.

089786,30,42,1r7z7m,195,"Well, I work in an office so I can pay for college and all that. My supervisor is the department secretary and I'm like her assistant secretary, but I do 90% of the work.  She is elderly and a very grouchy, sarcastic old lady.  She should have retired a few years ago,  but she just sticks around because she literally can dump her work on me and get away with it. 

When our boss asks her to do something, she will say, ""sure thing!"" And the minute he is back in his office, she gives the work to me, goes back to reading or watching tv, and then takes credit once I finish the work.  

She isn't very good with computers, either.  She always has to ask me how to get back to her email, how to buy stuff online, how to add an attachment to an email, etc. She has recently discovered amazon prime, so she has me log her into her account every day so she can watch her show for the entire work day. 

She also never allows her computer to turn off because she doesn't like waiting for it to do its updates, whereas if she did them every day, the updates would take just a few seconds.

Cikedo,15,30,1r739n,169,"(**No spoilers!** Don't worry!)


So, my mom's been bugging me to take her to see Catching Fire (the sequel to the Hunger Games), I'd never even seen the first, but I agreed, watched The Hunger Games, and picked her up and took her to the movies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm such a good boy.).

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

They don't. They get more and more obnoxious every 10 minutes, and I have turned around and told them to be quiet (nicely), someone several chairs DOWN from me yells for them to be quiet, and someone a couple rows BACK asks them to be quiet.

I give it one more ""**Shut. Up.**"", to no avail.

....and then it fucking happens. Problem number 3: I zone out for 10 fucking seconds thinking ""JUST SHUT UP!"", miss some huge announcement in the movie, and I'm **lost**. I have no idea what just happened, or why the music got all sad, or what was just said.

I don't get mad easily, but I'm pretty god damn mad at this point. I briskly jog to the managers desk and I simply say

&gt; ""Look, I missed a huge plot point because of these guys. They shut up briefly, and then resume talking. I'm missing even more of the action right now. You will come tell them to be quiet, and 5 minutes later, they'll resume again. Please, don't make me come back out here. I've already missed the excitement in the beginning of the movie, don't make me miss more.""

Sure enough, he comes in, shuts them up. Sure enough, they start talking again. 2 people beside me stand up and turn around, and before they can even say anything.... the manager is there with his hand up in true ""I've got this"" fashion, and escorts all the little chatter boxes out.

I walked out with a couple people (who were presumably going to concession), so no one knew of my heroic actions, but I will rest well knowing I avenged my fellow movie goers, anonymous or not.

KiranPanesar,29,43,1r5e44,158,"So I'm a Computer Science student at university. There's this one guy in my class who has talked through pretty much every lecture so far, no matter how many times people politely ask him.

So, this afternoon I find myself sitting behind this jackass and, lo and behold, he's chatting away like it's his living room.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

Blackmaille,25,47,1r4zlw,165,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

You better believe we managed to get that chain out on time, all hands on deck and pushing other orders down the cue. You also better believe that I wrapped every individual spool of chain with enough cling film and packing tape to choke a moose. For security reasons, of course.

LochnessLurky,13,48,1r0cz0,141,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

Redsnork,9,29,1r3gpz,136,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,165

This is a little more ""fun"" than most posts on here as it contains no real malice or anger, but I think it's funny nonetheless.

I had a roommate in college, let's call him Bob.  Bob's a great guy and we got along great, living together for about 3 years in college.  For various reasons, I moved around a lot after college and ended up moving back in with Bob for about a year and a half.

During this time, Bob decided to start messing with my computer.  Bob is a bit of prankster by nature.  Mostly it was minor stuff that was mildly annoying (picking the bathroom lock and pouring cold water on me in the shower, hiding and trying to scare the shit out of me when I come around a corner, etc).  I am really not prankster, but I will only take so much before I get revenge.

Bob wasn't great with computers beyond the basics like web surfing, typing, etc, but I think I know the day that he learned out how to change desktop backgrounds because I came into my room to find a naked dude, hand on his manhood, as my desktop background.  Bob was hiding out and giggled when he saw me discover the prank.  I rolled my eyes, changed the background back, and did what I needed to do on my computer.  I probably should have set a password on my computer at this point, but who wants to do that?

Anyway, I come back later in the day to find the same picture as my background.  Bob laughs.  I change it back again, silently making a note to think of a revenge plan.

Bob traveled a fair amount for his work, but it did not always require his work laptop, so he often left it at home.  Shortly after I found a naked dude as my background, he went out of town for work and I had decided how I was going to get revenge.

I opened up his laptop to discover he had set a password.  His girlfriend (who also lived with us) happened to be around and she helpfully gave me the password (she did her best to stay out of our pranks on one another so she assumed she could avoid blowback by helping me) and I set about doing the deed.

Cut to a couple days later when Bob comes home.  He opens up his laptop and clicks on IE to do some surfing.  A gay porn video immediately starts and I start laughing.  He scowls at me and says sarcastically something to the effect of ""that's funny"" and then tries to open IE again.  Same result.  

He tries various other shortcuts on his desktop only to find that I have helpfully reset all of his shortcuts to point at the gay porn video that I had downloaded and hidden on his hard drive.  After watching the first few seconds of the video the fourth time, he starts whining about it being his work computer and how I need to fix it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't want to get into trouble.

Being the nice guy I am, I fix it.  He didn't mess with my computer again.  And I think he was annoyed with his girlfriend for throwing him under the bus.  Not my problem.

Last night I went to lock the chickens up, but it was already dark outside so I really couldn't see into the coop.  I noticed that one of the chickens looked like it was not on its normal roost so I went and got a light to investigate further.
Well, I discovered that there was a raccoon hiding out in one of the nesting boxes, so I set a trap at the entrance to the coop and after some yelling and banging, I was able to get the raccoon to run out and into the trap.

By this time, I was feeling pretty smug.  I had trapped the stinky, murderous raccoon, and was deciding its fate.  It was being pretty aggressive and I decided to take my flashlight and give the raccoon a poke (it's pretty small and fit between the wires of the cage).  Well, the raccoon was having none of that, and it bit the end of the light and pulled it into the cage.  Of course, at this time I was pissed that the dumb raccoon was going to waste my batteries because I certainly wasn't going to be able to get the light back until the morning when it was time to evict the critter.

This morning I went out and discovered that in his act of petty revenge, the raccoon had completely destroyed the flashlight.  There were a few chunks strewn about the cage and I found the batteries and the bulb.  I'm not positive, but I think the raccoon had a little smirk on its face...

marvin,11,20,1r3fov,94,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one.

just_a_spoonful,7,34,1r7pgf,87,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

**Story:** On the bus going back to school the last seat available is beside me and one last girl gets on and sits beside me. She has one backpack and a small rolling luggage. She tries to stuff it under the seat but unfortunately it didn't fit so she just left it in the aisle. For the first half of the ride she played Candy Crush quietly on her tablet which was fine by me but the second half of the ride she got a phone call and then proceeded to bitch at the other person on the end. She was really loud and complaining that whatever she was being asked to do and how she was studying and it stressed her out yada yada

What was she complaining about? About feeding chickens, about how she wanted a new chicken coop and that no one was feeding her chickens. She was yelling at the other person about how they're lazy and all they do is go to work and eat. She kept going in circles about how it stressed her out and how she wanted to speak to her mother. People sitting around us were also staring and shaking their heads. I usually nap during my bus rides but she was too loud and moved while she spoke.

When we arrived I was finally happy to be able to go home but she proceeds to go through her texts on her phone and her bag is blocking the aisle and people behind us can't get off. She's so absorbed in her texts that people saying excuse me and trying to shuffle past her bag didn't phase her.

I wanted to tell her to move the fuck out of my way but then I decided to get petty. My book bag was on my lap the entire ride so I moved my book bag with as much force I could muster after a cramped 2 hour bus ride towards the my left side where she was sitting. It nearly knocked her phone out of her hand and she finally looked up and saw that all of the seats in front of her were empty and people behind her bag were waiting to get off and staring at her.

On our way home my friend that was driving switched lanes in front of one of those assfucks that try to speed up before you can get into their lane, but she had the faster car and got over.

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us. They proceed to pass is, barely avoiding hitting us, and try to brake check us (horribly, if I may add). Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us. Each time we tried to pass they'd move over a few inches (seriously the lanes are so fucking small) and the driver had to slam on her brakes.

We reached a red light. We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us. We stopped far enough back that they couldn't do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gestures.

PapBear,8,19,1qtwz8,75,"Hello ultiophilic brethren! I was on our sub and came across [this story] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1qtf4z/petty_revenge_so_sweet_i_fell_asleep/) and reminded my of last flight experience. I hope yall like it

The last time I flew was around a year ago from Atlanta to Memphis. I know, almost not a real flight; you spent more time being groped than actually in the air. Whatever. 

Anyway, I'm 6'3""+ and about 280-290 lbs, with a football lineman build. I'm also black, remember this part. 

We start flying, blah blah. I've got my music going, I'm knee-deep into the seat before me, and the dude in front of me starts trying to push his seat back. I say trying because it failed each time, and I was just sitting there. 

I felt bad for the guy at first since he probably wanted to relax and nap. That sentiment lasted until he started pounding my knees vigorously by means of plane seat, as if it'd help him bust a quickie. I heard him mutter something about entitled fat black people, and then he started back again. 

Now I'll never be skinny, and never have been. But I feel like I look decent; got some fat and some muscle, and it's like that (and that's the way it is. Unh!). For the black part, I'm pretty sure entitlement is rather separate from race. After the umpteenth time, I readjusted myself, ensuring he could go nowhere. I heard his frustation. The dude even called a flight attendant, presumably to move some imagined whale of lore.

She comes, hears him out, whining and rambling as an entitled douche would. She looks back at me, and subtly smirks. I give her a thumbs up. She leaves and a wait a few minutes. 

Multiply the following sequence by 5. 

""PapBear uses Mega Kick!

Plane lands, and we're getting up and out. Who do I see, short and squat, trying to reach his oversized bag? The dude from in front of me! He's struggling a bit; he looks like 5'5"" version of Kirby, but uncool and stuff. He looked over expectanty at me, and I ask him if that's his bag. He confirms. 

Me: ""Seems like you wore yourself out beating the seat. Happy stretcher-cises""

Insert his ""I just ate shit pie face"" upon realization that this big black dude was behind him, and heard everything he said.

bassboyjoe,12,14,1r3dao,73,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

I was at a friend's house warming party with a group of friends, it was also her flatmate's birthday party. I knew maybe a third of the people there, seeing as we all go to the same university.

I'm having a great night with mates from my uni course and my flat mates. We're all fairly drunk by this point. A friend, lets call her Jane, comes up to me and she looks a bit upset and fairly pissed off. I ask what's up and Jane tells me that some guy had just been talking to his friends and essentially told them that he had gotten with her one time, clearly trying to impress them.

This never happened, she doesn't know the guy, none of my mates with me there did either.

So she asks me if I wouldn't mind just pretending to be her boyfriend and having a chat with him. I'm pretty pissed off with what this dick's been saying so I think I'll go have a talk. I'm not a confrontational person, I always try to defuse situations, I'm not the sort of guy to go over and smack him in the face; but honestly I was angry enough that if refused I was ready to threaten him at the very least.

Jane points me in his direction, so I stroll over, he's currently standing near some of his friend with a drink, holding his phone. So I say, ""Hi, how are you? I don't think we've met. I'm Ecklcakes.""

""Oh hi, I'm good, I'm Carlos.""
(again made up name, mostly because I don't actually remember)

""Nice to meet you, listen, I just heard that you might have been saying something about my girlfriend, Jane, and I think you might want to apologise.""

I'm smiling, speaking in a pleasant tone and generally trying to look as non-threatening as possible. I'm not a big guy or anything, I'm average height and this guy has a few inches on me, similar builds, maybe I'm slightly sturdier looking.

In any case, this guy could probably take me on, if you look at it from the logic of a bigger drunk guy. But as soon as I say those words the guy pales, goes completely still and starts stammering out an apology and takes back everything he said.

And man it felt so good seeing him shit himself like that, almost felt sorry for the dickhead.

I feel like my relaxed nature and smile while saying something which sounds almost like a threat probably took him completely off guard and he realised he had fucked up in the first place. Alcohol can make you do stupid things I guess. Cheers for reading.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off. This Jeep now comes barreling down the street as I was halfway over the crosswwalk. They honked the horn at me a bunch of times, banged on the windows and (in the few seconds it took them to drive by) were just general asshats. 

Normally I wouldn't give a fuck but after a long ass day I was tired and my bullshit tolerences were at an all time low. I would have just carried on my merry way home, longingly thinking of the warm shower and hot food that awaited me.

With nary a person in sight. I sprang into action and quickly and quietly walked up to the drivers side wheel. Making sure i wasn't seen I reached down and stole the valve cap/air pressure cap for the tire. Then walked around and did the same thing to the rear passengers.

I was going to the grocery store just for a quick purchase. In the parking lot, parked in front of me, I spotted a white car who's parked on two parking spots (the like between the two was going almost perfectly under the middle of the car). I saw cars parking like that often, but this time, it was grinding my gears at the highest point. 

My first idea was to leave a note saying ""You park like an asshole"" and leave, but I was out of paper. I was about to give up my plan until I had an idea. I took a picture of the licence plate and went to a cashier inside the grocery store. I told the cashier that I saw a tow truck around the car, like it was about to tow it, and that I guessed that it was because of the way it was parked (I thought about it, I wanted the owner to know somehow) And then, I go to make my purchase.

Less than a minute after (I told you guys it was a QUICK purchase), I go back to the cashier and pay for my purchase. Since it was the same one I saw a minute before, she starts giving me updates on the car situation, letting me know that everything was okay, no tow truck was there anymore. The cashier even pointed me who was the vehicle owner. 

Cashier : There was no tow truck you told me, right?

Owner : Nope. None. I guess it was okay, kind of a false alarm.

Me : Well, how disappointing.

PurplePeduncles,9,19,1qzihb,63,"This happened at the store I worked in and didn't involve me, but I figured the story was worth telling. On my mobile so excuse formatting (and long text, I've put in a TL;DR)

I was hired as a sales assistant in a new branch of a large footwear company, along with several other new employees. The store opened a couple of weeks ago and, for the most part, the new team all get along and everyone is friendly. However, the new supervisor (let's call him Pete) had already shown himself to be... not exactly the best supervisor. Put briefly, he got into arguments with the manager of the store that he trained in, childishly complained that he wanted to go home one evening when everyone was staying up late getting the shop set-up, and then disappeared without telling anyone when he was told that he needed to stay, and generally did not follow instructions or act professionally in store. 

On one of these occasions, our area manager was visiting, and this pretty much resulted in her telling our manager (we'll call her Amy) to ""get rid of him"". His next shift comes around, and he is called into the office for a 'meeting', and (even though our manager didn't want to as she has always gotten along with him) he is fired on the spot.

However, this wasn't the end of it for Pete.

First, he put in an appeal to get his job back. Fair enough, but seeing as the area manager herself told Amy to fire him, chances of that were slim.

A few days later, we spot Pete and his girlfriend walking around the shopping centre. You have to get a bus out to where we are, so everyone thinks this is a bit odd, but brushes it off. Later on his girlfriend walks into the shop, looks around, then leaves. No big deal. Until, that is, we're cleaning up and we find the notice for his replacement screwed up into a little ball and stuffed into a shoe. Very professional.

But wait, there's more. A little while after we find the notice, an angry-looking guy in his 40s strides up to me, and demands that he talk to the manager, naming her, saying they ""need a private chat"". He refuses to give a name. Amy comes out, and he insists they go into the stock room to talk. Fast forward a little bit, he leaves, and Amy reveals that the mystery man was none other than Pete's dad (Pete is 18 but has moved in with his girlfriend) who has demanded to know why his son had been fired because he was being blamed for something my assistant manager mistakenly did a few days prior (long story short, if you're going to comment on customers, wait until they've left the store and can't hear you...). Pete's dad threatens Amy with solicitors and appeals, but after explaining why Pete had actually been fired, he looks pretty embarrassed and left.

We figured it would end there, but nope, he had one last stunt to pull. Amy used to be the assistant manager in another store in the shopping centre we're in, and is still in contact with her old colleagues. A couple of days ago, she gets a text from one of them saying 'I've had someone called Pete hand in a CV today saying ""This is to replace Amy"" '. Reeeeal mature.

His appeal hearing is this Friday with our area manager, who has been made aware everything that has gone on. In this case, I really don't think any amount of petty revenge will help him get his job back.


TL;DR - Supervisor lost his job, appealed for wrongful dismissal, then ripped down the ad for his replacement and left it in the shop, sent his dad in to shout and my manager, then applied to 'replace' my manager's place at her previous job. Before his appeal.

The most recent one this morning was as follows:

""All he does is sit in there and fuck around on that god damned computer. Wish I could sit around and fuck off all day and get paid for it. Lazy fuck."" This is said out in the lab where he seems to forget sound rebounds and comes back into the front area where i work. I let it slide, as I don't need to worry about his grievances and just focus on my work. However, he didn't leave it be at that. Not ten minutes later as I am working on my second tray of samples for the morning, he comes in and snaps his fingers at me to go faster. ""get the lead out"", he has shit to do and wants off early. I grit my teeth and just continue on my way. But oh no my friends, I am not letting this slide.

After he leaves work today, and up until the end of the year, I am going to snap the pencil lead in all of his pencils at his work station, making it so he has to sharpen his pencils first thing every day for the rest of the year. Who needs to get the lead out now, Mr. Complains-a-lot?

crazypancakes,9,15,1r4yhp,50,"I am fully aware we bring this on ourselves, and the whole incident could be avoided if we are better at doing laundry, but here it is.

BACKSTORY: We have two kids; a two year old, and a seven month old. We both work, and haven't quite figured out how to balance looking after the kids and doing all the housework. We're doing OK, but there's always something that can be done; laundry specifically.

THE REVENGE: When my Mother-in-law looks after the kids, after the kids are asleep for nap time, my MIL will very kindly clean up a little bit and do laundry (very nice of her). However, whenever she puts our (my wife and I) laundry away, she ALWAYS puts it away in a place it doesn't go. At first, I put it down to the fact she doesn't live here, so probably has no idea which drawer we put things. But, I noticed that when she puts away underwear for example, even if I have a full drawer full of clean underwear, so it is pretty obvious that is its home, she will put my underwear with my shirts. 

I don't know if she knows I know. But I know. ",My Mother-in-law's petty revenge,65

My internet shuts off at midnight (please see: mother is insane), which means that when I get home, I have half an hour to rush through any homework that involves the internet, and then I have to finish the rest of it.  By then, it's about 2 or 3 am, and I get up at 5:30, so I usually just pass out.  

 I didn't get the dishes done.  My sister could've helped out, except that she's trying to maintain straight A's and get a scholarship, since my parents didn't save for our university at all.  So my mother decided that, since we didn't get dishes done every night, we are now no longer allowed to eat.  We may have one peanut butter sandwich a day, and a handful of carrot sticks.  

It's still my job to make dinner for my parents and youngest sister.  I should also mention that my mother is obese, and ""trying"" to lose weight.  So last night, dinner was supposed to be a low fat burrito.  And it was.  With extra sour cream, full-fat chese (two slices), two tortillas (lightly buttered.  She didn't even notice the taste), and extra meat.  

Desert was a small slice of sugar-free pumpkin pie.  With real, extra-sugary, home-whipped cream.

When I tried to get her keys last night, she gave me a ton of attitude about how I was messing up her day and wasting her time making her dig through her purse for keys at 11 pm at night.  

The reality was I had an appointment to get her Christmas presents installed.  A new stereo with bluetooth for Pandora and a remote starter, becaues it gets cold in Nebraska in the winter and she hates scraping.  She's been complaining about the remote starter for at least two years ago.

When I walked in, there was a girl drying her hands. Okay, no problem. I go to the bathroom and she's still drying her hands. The. *whole*. time. I get out, and wash my hands.

melkaynun,12,10,1qsxyj,43,"I go to school about 2 &amp; 1/2 hours away from my hometown. I like to go home some weekends to see my family just like any college student would. To get home I literally get on the highway in the city I go to school in and stay on the same highway until I get home. Most of the time the highway is two lanes, 70 miles an hour. I was in the left lane going about 78 (cruise control that bitch) and there was a car a little behind me in the right lane going probably 70-72ish.

There was definitely enough room between me and the car on the right for someone to pass into the left lane and get around the car if they wanted to. BUTTTTTT, this dillbeck car starts coming in hot (definitely over 80) in the right lane and starts riding this cars ass (EVEN THOUGH there was more than enough room for him to pass it). He starting flashing his brights, laying on the horn, he rolled down the window and flipped the driver off. 

You best believe that when i saw that he was going to FINALLY get over and try to pass the car I slowed down so that I was going the same speed as the other car and drove right beside the person so that the douche lord speed demon couldn't get around either of us.

He rode both of our asses until he got off the exit and I went back to my normal speed.

EDIT: (from comment cause i'm lazy) It would have probably been smart for me to say that I was in the process of passing the car that was on the right when this happened. there weren't any other cars around in front or behind me so I didn't feel the need to take off my cruise control so I took my time passing the car.

The_Forbidden_Toot,13,12,1r0gs1,42,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

Takalak,3,7,1r3707,44,"Sweet, sweet, petty revenge! I'm posting over my phone for the first time, so I hope nothing goes wrong. 

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did. He stood up and I think he said excuse me, but I had earbuds in and pretended I couldn't hear him. I leaned forward in the universal ""I'm getting off at the upcoming stop"" position but I held off on actually getting up until the last minute, making him stand and wait. Ha!

-AreYouAWizard-,5,9,1r1c3w,37,"  So the thing is that in my house, my mom makes us scrub the bottom of our shoes every night so that we don't track dirt all over our apartment. Among me and my brother, we share this chore and alternate on who does it every night.
  On to the story.
  Like most people, I really love to sleep. This particular night I had a lot of homework, and was just exhausted from five hours of homework and projects. I go to sleep and about fifteen minutes in my brother wakes me up by violently kicking my bed (we share a bunk bed, me being on the top bunk) from below. Why? I have no fucking clue, he's just being a little shit. This would not go unpunished.

biddoodles,11,11,1qqyob,39,"**The Preface:**
So I work in a locally owned Italian restaurant as a server and have been there over a year. I've proven to my bosses and managers that I can handle my own sections, etc. Fridays are normally our busiest nights as we have a list of reservations and just as many walk-ins. On this particular night I'm given the back section, which contains two 6-tops, two 4-tops, and one 2-top.(#-tops is how many people a table can seat for those unfamiliar) The back section is also right beside Dishland and the bus room where we dump our dirty dishes. Alright, enough preface. Onto the revenge.

**The Setup:**
I'm in the back section tonight and I get sat back-to-back, so my section fills up quickly. I'm basically in catch-up mode at this point trying to meet all the demands of my tables. A family of 6 walks in and sits at my table. The head of the table, lets refer to him as Comb Over, takes it upon himself to hastily tell me they need their drinks and order taken asap. Normally, not a problem, but on a busy night, yeah bit of a problem. I'm rather busy already having been sat so quickly, and try and run around to get them their drinks and take their order. Not to mention, we're backed up in the kitchen because the orders are coming in out the ass. Go figure the entire table orders a different drink, so I have to prepare 5 separate drinks. I take their order and they want something changed in every item they order, sauce on side, light sauce, they want something substituted, yadda yadda. Basically every server's pain in the ass group.

**The Annoyance:**
CO decides to be a big shot tonight and flag me down every time someone at his table needs something instead of waiting 5 minutes for me to come around. CO stops me for every little thing so I can't get all of these things in bulk. Need a new fork because CO dropped his, need more water, a 2nd and 3rd Shirley Temple, want more coffee, more sugar, more water, creamer, this that, Ugh! They're chugging their drinks like fucking camels too and I still have 4 other tables I'm trying to keep happy as well. I counted up in my head and CO stopped me about 16 times, all before they even get their entree(approx 25 mins) and I'm fed up. I'm trying to clear dishes off of one table and CO stops me yet again, hands full of dirty dishes, to get him more coffee creamer. I say I will and walk past him to dump the dishes off in the bus room beside them. I come back empty handed and CO locks eyes with me, probably assuming I had forgotten and throws his hands in the air with a look of irritation. I walk by him on my way to the kitchen pissed at this point and grab a water for another table and a hand full of fucking creamer. I walk right out and slam down the handful of creamer and strut off.

**The Revenge:**
Just after that, their food shows up. I walk back and pass it out, asking if they need anything else. Surprise surprise, not a single person has something they need and no one will make eye contact with me. I walk off to tend to my other tables and ignore them until the end of the meal. I see that they have 2 coupons out and i walk over to take care of them, them only talking enough to explain which dish to put on which check. A smirk hits my face because with coupons I get to add gratuity (it's stated on the bottom of the coupon so they know this before they use it). I run their cards and sneak off to the kitchen and return with another coffee creamer. With a huge forced grin and the fakest 'Thanks for coming' I could muster, I pass out both checks and for CO's check I place a lovely coffee creamer on the top of the ticket.

I wanted to laugh so hard when I went back and smirked to myself in the kitchen.

Needless to say they complained that I was the worst server they've ever had. My manager understood how they were so I didn't get in trouble. Her response: ""Everyone needs to work in retail and food service just once to understand what they put us through."" I hope CO comes back and dreads his decision when he sees that I'm the one who gets to serve them again.",Would you like cream with that comb over?,50

When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls.

I'd have had nicer stuff in my apartment, but both last year and the year before that when they were doing move-outs for the roommates that were not staying (we each rent only our rooms, and it's a 4 room apartment) the service people they sent in to clean the apartments did not perform as admirably as desired. 

The first year, they came into my locked room and completely trashed up the place, throwing all my belongings on the ground in the center of the room so they could paint it.

Today, he found out that everyone else in the group has decided to sign onto a lease for a house next year and left him out deliberately, because they've sided with the girl over this drunken argument they had.

aub51zzz,18,24,1qy3oa,23,"**Some brief background info:** 
I worked for a couple of years during high school at a fast food chain that served only fried chicken fingers and a few sides that were not exactly the healthiest. By no means is our food unhealthy enough to cause heart problems, but we are not exactly a ""health food"" restaurant. Our menu is small and somewhat limited, but people enjoy coming to our restaurant and enjoy our food. 

**The story:** 
It’s a slow day, and I am enjoying the shift working the drive-thru. When we are not as busy, it is easier for me to strike up conversation with our customers, and being able to talk to some of them really brightens my day. Of course, there are always a few exceptions. But I am having a fairly good day. 

At one point, a car pulls up to the speaker to order food. After saluting her with a suger-coated greeting, the customer speaks. “Hi, yes… Ummm… Do you have grilled chicken?”

It is not an uncommon request, but it is also one I am unable to fulfill. I regretfully respond, ""I apologize, ma'am, we only serve our chicken fingers fried.""

The woman gasps as if her life were just threatened. ""*What?!* So you only serve fried chicken?""

""Yes, ma'am, only fried,"" I reiterated. 

I can hear her chuckling over the headset. ""Well, it seems to me that you have no concern for those living a *healthy* lifestyle."" (Note: this is a **fast food** place.) 

""I can offer you unsalted fries as well as toast without the butter,"" I reply, doing my best to be helpful even though this lady seems pretentious. “For drinks, we also have-”

The customer interrupts me with a sound of pure disgust. “No. I don’t want your… your… Ugh.” She apparently does not have the right vocabulary in her mental arsenal to describe the food that repulsed her so.  “I just want a large diet soda.” 

This confused me slightly; I wouldn’t imagine a woman who seems to be a “health nut” to order any kind of soda. Maybe she was simply counting calories, but to me it was counter-intuitive to her previous disgust. 

She pulls to my window and paid for her 32oz drink, her angry, glaring eyes set fixedly on me. I hand her the soda, and before I could say another word the woman speeds off, obviously still perturbed. I am not too bothered, and the shift continues as usual. 

**The (*petty*) revenge:** Little did she know, I filled half of her drink with her requested diet soda, and the other half with regular. 

Enjoy the calories, bitch.



Edit: If I would have believed my revenge to be dangerous, I would not have done so. I have had gluten allergies brought to my attention, and I feel awful when there isn't really anything I can do. But this woman was obviously concerned for her health, which means she should go out to a fast food place. 

Also, diet soda is worse for you than regular. It just has less calories and less sugar. 

So to those of you claiming this was dangerous - I assure you it was not. This was a rare instance when I enacted petty revenge on a customer (I don't spit in food because that's sick.) 

But I will be filling a soda with half water or seltzer next time... That's genius!!

Morkant,7,21,1qr3bn,23,"So a few years back I worked at a fast-food restaurant in Canada. As an employee there I was required to work drive-thru on occasion which meant serving hundreds of people their food over the course of my shift. 


With hundreds of people coming through. And my shifts being later in the day (4-11 being the most common) I would try and be smiling and upbeat for every customer that came through. But sometimes you get that one that's so rude, you just need to stand up for yourself somehow.


So I'm working the drive-thru, it's mid-evening, about 7-8 o'clock and the rush has died down. The store is fairly empty and there's only a few of us left working (night shift doesn't get in until 10:30). I hear a beep at my headpiece and I answer a middle aged man's call for a pair of donuts. 


Grabbing the donuts I quickly trotted over to the drive-thru window and took his money whilst handing him his donuts in a little paper baggy. Thinking that was the end of it I smiled at him, and turned to resume mopping the floor as he drove off. 10 seconds later I hear a voice through the window (I'd left it open) and see the man is back. He'd reversed back into the drive-thru, only to end up a good 10 feet away from the window. Yelling angrily about how I'd gotten the wrong donuts he proceeded to throw the donuts (still in baggy) at full force through the window, forcing me to snatch them out of mid air before they hit the wall and went everywhere.


I don't think I made a mistake with his order, and either way company policy said I was going to replace it anyways, but there was no reason for him to be such an ass about it. Throwing away the old order, I went and got the 2 new donuts that he requested and walked back to the window to find him standing there, having gotten out of the car. With a massive grin on my face, I handed him the donuts and asked ""What? You didn't want to catch?"" ",We're Not Playing Catch?,44

BNugget,0,3,1r8juf,37,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting.

jmorlin,9,35,1qqfbe,16,"Last year was my freshman year of college and a close friend of mine from the fifth grade through highschool ended up in the same dorm building.  Familiarity breeds contempt, and I like to say that our friendship is built on a mutual hate. We argue, mock, and generally fuck with each other all the time but it rarely becomes heated enough to start a real fight. 

Well for whatever reason sometime last spring we fought over something and it became physical with me slapping him then being tackled by him. We were separated by mutual friends then went back to our own rooms to cool off. 

Over the next week or so we went back to aloud regual routine but I still wanted revenge.

One night a few of us were sitting around in his dorm room watching TV.  Right before leaving for dinner I made sure to be the last one out of the room and got the device out of my bag, turned it on, and his it under the radiator. After dinner we came back up to his room to play some Mario Kart.  Now at random intervals the device began to make high pitched beeping and buzzing sounds.  After a while everyone else in the room began to wonder what it was and started to look for it, but to no avail.  There were roughly 2 months left of school before summer break at this point and we would hang out in his room almost daily because he didn't have a roommate (no one had to get caught in the cross fire).  He quickly became infuriated at the beeping and buzzing and at least once dragged his mattress out to the lounge so he could sleep. He tore apart his room on multiple occasions looking for the source and even considered calling housing to see if they could fix the problem. The whole time I was really enjoying myself.  I was slowly driving him insane. In the end I mentioned it to one of our other friends so he would stop looking for the source, but he ended up ratting me out at the end of the year.

AnoruleA,16,18,1r6kqx,22,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,40

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,19,46,1r5ydj,15,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

oohfriedrice,3,14,1qqwlg,14,"**TL;DR: Fedora Wearing Douche Canoe causes the One Act Drama productions to have a huge amount of drama, so I tell him his essay is perfect even though it is a piece of shit with no main idea that didn't respond to the writing prompt.**

The yearly student directed one act drama productions began with a shit load of drama. After each director auditions everyone, all the directors fight for who they want to cast because it is un-ideal to cast one person in multiple shows. There is an unspoken rule of seniority. Note the word ""unspoken"". Directors who have directed before and are seniors have seniority and basically are allowed to cast whoever they want. Seniority is then given based on age, so if a senior director and junior director have a conflict over casting, the senior director gets who they want. Due to the dearth of males in drama, it was a fight to the death to cast the male you wanted. 

There are six directors: Awesome Girls (AG) who have directed twice before and are seniors, Drama Club President (DCP), Fedora wearing Ass Hat (FDAH) who caused this conflict, Girl who tries to mediate everything and fails, me, and Young Jew Sophmore (YJS). FDAH and his co-director (a senior) wrote their own one act while AG got theirs online. 

AG and FDAH want to cast the same male as their lead, but FDAH disregards the fact that AG has SENIORITY over him claiming his one act is the most important. Though AG present a perfectly valid argument about how it is their last year directing, FDAH says this is not a valid argument and says he should get said male. After 10 minutes of steam escaping from multiple peoples' ears, FDAH says he has to leave and study for a math test the following day and write an essay due the following day. He also says that he is content with casting (DCP) as his lead, relinquishing his hold on the male he had first wanted to cast.

DCP posts potential cast list online for everyone to see, and FDAH says he is casting the male actor he had given away to AG because ""he had yet to hear an argument that has persuaded him"". The guy does not get the unspoken rule of seniority; he just cares about himself.The resulting conversation resulted in a GINORMOUS timesink of 82 minutes, and I'm only at home for 180 minutes before internet shuts off. 

He further went on to say he was going to ask said male whose one act he wants to be in, which a) informs male about our inner troubles and b) puts him between a rock and a hard space. In order to justify his action, FDAH said "" If &lt;actors name&gt; wants to be in both casts,fine, if not, such is life"", yah FDAH thanks for screwing us over. Being that now the cast lists are far from complete, DCP proposes another meeting the next day. YAY, more time wasted in result of FDAH.

Not ten minutes after posting that he was taking the male actor, FDAH asks me if I can edit his essay as we are in the same literature class. Analysis of quotes from the book was needed in this essay to prove if the book should be banned or not, but sadly, FDAH did not get this memo. He used quotes from other sources that did nothing to prove his point. I told him his essay was perfect and that he would get A even though he did actually complete the essay prompt and had several items in his essay on the automatic zero list.

Shezzam,5,21,1r7r6e,0,"Eight years ago, my husband and I bought our first home together. He was earning a decent wage, but to do more than live pay check to pay check, I got a job at the same dealership my husband was a mechanic workshop foreman at. To avoid child care, I worked Wednesday nights to 7pm and Saturdays until 1pm.  I just wanted to take the edge off things like school fees and council rates. During winter months, I would get home well after dark, all I asked for was that the front porch light be left on. Our front door had no natural light, it was pitch black, and a tricky, dangerous pea gravel pathway (now gone).
 
This one Wednesday night, I got home about 7:30pm, as normal, but was busting for a wizz. No front light was left on, I couldn't see to get my keys into the lock. After knocking, then trying for about five minutes and nearly wetting myself, I finally got inside and ran to unleash the flood.
Wondering where everyone was, as it was so early, I crept through the house. I checked that the light was, in fact, off &amp; not blown. 

All three kids were asleep. The husband was naked &amp; ~~asleep~~ ~~passed out drunk~~ comatose on our bed, spread eagled like a starfish, in the universal husbandly sign for ""I want some lurving, please indulge me when you arrive henceforth"". 

Totally pissed at no light being left on, I made sure I put on two layers of jammies and slept in the kids room on their pull out bed, with my smallest girl. 
The next afternoon I asked him to ""change the light bulb that must have blown last night while I was at work"", he tried the light (lol), and then got busy ""changing the light"" for about half an hour.

Cut to a week later, I had said nothing more, but was dropping the kids off to him at his worksite on my way to the other site I was based at. The kids were watching tv &amp; I was saying hello to the 3 service advisors while the husband was clocking off, I told them all about it. 
Now, these boys know how to roll with a Shezzam punchline, and managed not to laugh until he walked in to the office, and one of them asked ""Hey mate your front light bulb blow?"".
He went bright red and asked ""No, Why?"" 
The boys all starting laughing and the husband realised that he'd been caught out, and publicly had his romantic moves shared with his mates. 
The light was on every night after that, but hey, so were my jammies. Starfish that one naked husband.

daniellelasvegas,119,386,1r28l6,1291,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

neenerneenerboo,69,486,1qw75b,1263,"Sorry this is long. But oh so sweet. 


This guy that went to my high school, Jimmy, was the absolute worst. He was the typical asshole jock—everyone let him get away with shit. But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes. I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way, so he thought we were even friends. 


My main beef with him was the way he treated girls. Though Jimmy wasn’t very attractive, he coasted on popularity, and our school was very small with more girls than boys. He mostly preyed on underclassmen (my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy) but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be, so I witnessed over and over again as he’d suck in one of my friends, who would be convinced that he’s changed for her and being genuinely nice this time, and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested. 


He dated one of my friends, Jane, who is the sweetest person in the world. She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break. Telling her she’s gaining weight, flirting with other girls in front of her, general toying of her emotions. You could tell she was super stressed out, and finally she broke up with him. Wahoo! 


But it didn’t end there. We had assigned seats in computer class, and I sat between Jimmy and Jane’s sister, Beth, who is equally sweet. On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends (close to Mr. Teacher’s desk so he could try to keep them in check) where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were. Right after the breakup, Jimmy talked about how he’s over it and already has “a few public school sluts lined up,” (lols, private school life—this was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you “met on vacation so she lives in a different city”) and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane, and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth, who was not a confrontational person. 


I plotted. Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence. Since he was put in the spotlight so often, it was easy to see that while he could get an A+ at getting girls to send him nudes, he struggled academically. So, I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else. I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer, pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pull-out keyboard (there was a lot of hidden room, they sat just out of view above my own keyboard.) 


Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual, but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment, he just could not get it right. This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password. He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr. Teacher, who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmy’s information just fine. “Maybe you had your password wrong?” he says, but Jimmy is insistent that he isn’t that stupid and something is wrong with the computer. 


I tormented Jimmy for weeks, pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes. He would put his mouse icon over a button, and then I’d slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it, infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something. Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible. His documents were full of typos. He would type a word, and I would just press one letter to throw him off, and then he’d try again, only for the same thing to happen. Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead, but right-clicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention. Open the task manager while he’s in a program. He’d look away, and I’d close a window or document, or just press backspace until he turned around. I was careful to be pretty inconsistent—when other people were looking, I’d back off to make him look crazy. Whatever he’d been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over. My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard. 


I started to punish him this way. Wandering eye? Wandering mouse while he’s trying to play a game. Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman? Oh look, his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged. Ignore new girlfriend because it’s funny? Unexpected shutdown, because losing unsaved work is funnier. One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy, and I put a number at the end of his new password, and the same thing when he confirmed the password. This new password then didn’t work, and he couldn’t reset it again without knowing the current password. Jimmy was going nuts, but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didn’t know how to use a computer. He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer. His assignments took longer, so he had less time to horse around with his friends. People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class, and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything. 


One time, when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didn’t even have his hands on anything, I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen. His eyes widen and he shouts, “Look!” interrupting Mr. Teacher’s lecture. I stop. “It was doing it! My mouse was moving and I wasn’t even doing anything!” We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmy’s delusions as he keeps yelling, myself and Beth included, although we were laughing on the inside, giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmy’s meltdown. 


“That’s it,” Mr. Teacher said, worn thin over Jimmy’s incompetence. “No one else is having problems with that computer. You’re just not compatible, I guess. Move to that one.” He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students, which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers. 


Jimmy protests, suggesting Mr. Teacher “just fix it,” but at this point, Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too. We weren’t bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class. But to my surprise, Jimmy still had problems. Almost all the stuff I was doing. He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks, but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers. One day alone in the computer room, I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr. Teacher comes in. He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse, which wiggled around on Jimmy’s screen. 


“Wifi,” he explained. 


Turned out, Mr. Teacher knew what I was doing all along. He hated dealing with Jimmy too, and distracting him meant less class disruption. But after his meltdown, Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his far-away friends. 


Tl;dr: Guy is a douche to my friend, plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him. He goes crazy and everyone talks about it. 

Edit for more info: We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere, our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach, and he was Jimmy's track coach, so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class, they joked around a lot. At our school, the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal. He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough. He was just a few years out of college, and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruption.

Jimmy really actually was bad with computers. At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black. He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer. I know that using Bluetooth doesn't always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school, so perhaps that's what the teacher meant--I am really not that great with that stuff myself. Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts.

One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

compuhyperglobalmega,58,147,1qzcpe,702,"Was sitting in massive surface street commuter traffic.  This was 6-lane road near several shopping centers and multiple intersections jammed with cars, very slow going.  My goal was in sight, however.  If I could just make it through the next light, I could hit the freeway onramp and get out of here.  As luck would have it, the light turned red just as the car in front of me crawled through the intersection.  Stuck for another 5 minutes.  My own irritation was interrupted by a loud honk from behind, and I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a middle-aged woman in a lifted Ford F250 gesturing wildly at me, as though I cost her the light.

I just smiled and prepared to ignore her, until I noticed the red lights of a fire truck and EMT heading our way from behind, trying to make their way through the traffic jam.  There were so many cars with nowhere to go, at one point they were forced to cut through the shopping center parking lot.  

While I’m watching this drama unfold, our light turned green, and F250 lady immediately began honking and waving her arms at me.  What she didn’t notice through her rage (but everybody else on the road did), was just as the light turned green, the EVs had swung into the opposing traffic lanes which had cleared out. It was obvious they were going to hit our intersection and swing back into our lanes which had cleared out ahead of the intersection during the red light.  The only thing I could do was sit tight, keep the intersection clear, and stay out of the way. 

I just kept watching in my rearview as the lady became more and more enraged, and EVs got closer and closer.  She was laying on the horn continuously just as the EVs blew by on the left and swung in front of us and went on their way.  The look of horror on her face as she suddenly realized that everyone nearby was staring at her like the asshole she was, was doubled when our light turned red again before we could get through, and I got to watch her cringe with embarrassment for five more minutes.",Emergency Revenge,849

Redsnork,53,132,1r3jsq,595,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

ewwiccc,29,118,1qy875,516,"So I'm on my way to my work building this morning at 8am and I'm walking about 5-6 feet behind some woman. Usually when someone gets to the doors to the building you can see who is behind you because of the reflection in the all glass entrance. Well this woman made eye contact with me (not to mention I was stepping pretty loudly to signal that I was behind her) so she knew i was there. She decides to open the door about 1.5 feet, just enough for her to slip in sideways and allow it to immediately shut on me. 

Slightly annoyed... I reached to open the door, and even had time to wait a second to hold it for another woman walking behind me. Woman #2 walked into the first floor office to the right. Then woman #1 drops her phone as shes rushing to the elevators in the lobby. I just casually walked into the last open elevator... I leaned against the wall of the elevator and watched the doors start to close. 

Well I heard some shouting to ""hold the elevator""...Right when there was about half a foot left till it was closed, I caught a glimpse of her angry face ... I smiled and as they closed i heard ""DOUCHE"".

nappyheadedho,56,110,1r0678,516,"My freshman roommate seemed to be a pretty decent guy at first, but it quickly became apparent that it would be a tough year after he started to get comfortable. I like to go to sleep fairly early for a college student (around 11 PM or so), and my roommate goes to bed who knows when. This wouldn't be a problem if he just quietly did his homework or listened to his music through headphones. This is the opposite of what he does.

He likes to keep the room light on and loudly play the same Spotify playlist on repeat of about 6 songs exclusively taken from Madden NFL video game soundtracks. He also sings along. 

Every night I wake up to this and, as nicely as possible, ask him to use his desk lamp and headphones. He always does at first, but about 15 minutes later the light comes back on and the headphones come unplugged. I don't understand. I tried talking to him about it during the day, but he was unapologetic. 

Two nights ago I decided I'd had enough. He didn't have a morning class the next day, and I had to get up at 7 for my morning class. I set my alarm for six thirty and fought through the noise for the last time.

When I got up, I opened my laptop and played [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EGKt8yONI) (which I actually happen to enjoy) at full volume. Needless to say, he wakes up very confused. ""Can you use headphones or something, man?"" I plug in my headphones for approximately 5 minutes and then unplug them. He woke up again, and this time he clearly got the picture. He just covered his ears with his pillow until I left.

ignisira,62,80,1qujkz,465,"A couple of years ago, I worked as a cashier at a grocery store. I was used to dealing with rude customers, but this lady certainly took the cake. 

She comes up with two full carts, a huge stack of coupons, and a bunch of bratty kids. I heaved an internal sigh, and started scanning everything. The entire time this woman kept her beady eyes on the screen, and questioned every single thing I did.

The whole time, she also complained about stupid, lazy cashiers, to her bratty kids who were mixing up all of the candy bars on purpose. This woman looked me straight in the eyes, and said, ""I know these things are hard for people who aren't college educated.""

I was working on a Bachelor's at that time, and I was just about seething. I scanned in some organic grapes, but for whatever reason, they scanned in incorrectly as regular grapes. This woman starts shrieking and yelling at me for being incompetent and scanning them wrong. I realized, with the huge amount she was buying, the mistake would save her five dollars. I could have let it go. But instead, I called up the manager.

At this very moment, the woman seems to realize her mistake. ""No, no, it's okay,"" she said. ""It's fine, you can just keep them as they are.""

""Nonsense!"" I said, in the sweetest voice possible. ""We want your full satisfaction.""

We waited ten minutes for the manager to come (it was busy), and waited five or ten more for the manager to fix the mistake, and enter in the correct, more expensive price. She glared at me the entire time, and it was delicious.

DarthPaki,62,117,1qrjwh,428,"A bit of background, I'm 6'2"" with fairly long legs and I choose aisle seats when flying so I can stretch them every now and then.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was flying back from Vancouver to London and had settled in nice and early.  I was all ready to sleep most of the flight (popped some NyQuil, plane was landing in the afternoon, no jetlag!).  Now this really short guy gets on in the seat in front of me, he must've been 5'0""/5'1"" max (not hating on shorter people, just making an observation for the story).  Everyone settles in and gets ready for the flight and I pass out.

&amp;nbsp;

Cut to about half an hour into the trip, plane had just taken off, and I'm woken up by this guy just slamming his seat all the way back onto my legs.  Captain hasn't even turned off the seatbelt sign (the universal indication for ""go for it"").  I lean forward and politely ask the guy, ""can you please move your seat back a bit forward please.  I'm tall and you're bruising my knees"".  His response?  ""Whatever man, I paid for this seat"".  @$$hole mode, engage.

&amp;nbsp;

I make myself comfortable, take the magazines out of the seat pocket, slouch down a bit, and extend my legs to get comfortable to comfortably sleep.  I can now literally feel his spine on my knees.  Great.  I can poke him.  Man I feel a bit uncomfortable... guess I'll have to readjust my position every few minutes.  Does that mean my knees keep digging into his back?  Too bad.  Even when I'm not moving I could feel him trying to find a comfortable position.  I'd quickly move my knees so that by the time he leaned back again my knees had found his spine again.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept it up for at least 2-3 hours, the guy was stubborn as a mule.  He asked me if I could not hit him in the back and my response?  ""Sorry, I paid for the seat, you know?""  The look on his face was so priceless I wish I could have saved it somehow and show it my future grandkids (on the way after I get married and have actual kids as well), just to show them how badly PopPop (would love that as a grandad name) screwed over a douche on a plane.

&amp;nbsp;

He moved his seat back all the way up and didn't say anything for the rest of the flight.  Peace.

n33dyourlov3,37,105,1r13h2,430,"A few months ago I worked as a cleaning lady in a large day care. This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work. After a month of harassment, embarrassment, and belittling, I decided to walk out early-mid shift leaving good ol Nessa to clean the mess all by herself.","Treat me like a dog, I quit half way through my shift!!",535
k-squid,32,108,1qytdq,398,"My first job was in a bowling alley/arcade. I originally worked at the prize counter, and then switched over to the food court. They're not the best stories of revenge, but they felt pretty good for 16 year old me.

The first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker. During my first week, he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees. If I had a problem and went to ask him for help, he would refuse to move if I didn't have every minute detail, leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer. There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock, something I had been told was a fire-able offense. He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed. When introducing me to other employees or regulars, he would always say, ""That's k-squid, the lesbian,"" because I had a short hair cut. He also would refer to me as ""retard"" or call anything I liked ""retarded"".

You may be wondering whether or not I went to management. I did. Multiple times. I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing, but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like, ""Yep, that's Prick for you!"" I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts, but there were none available. I was stuck working with Prick all the time.

Eventually, we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school. In May of his senior year. No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED. 

Wat. 

On this particular night, some of Prick's friends had come in to say hi and play games, and Prick started making fun of everything about me, his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense. Finally, Prick says, ""K-squid, you're such a fucking retard."" Without skipping a beat, I replied, ""Yeah? I may be a retard, but at least I won't have to work here for the rest of my fucking life."" He stared at me, slack jawed, while his friends were rolling with laughter. He never called me retarded again.

The second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick, and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice. A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at, and it seemed definite that I would be hired. (I was, in the end.)

Being that the bowling alley was my first job ever, I was a total ~~model employee~~ suck up. I'd be there early every day, stay late, do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question, and took shifts for people whenever they asked. After switching to the food court, it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from 2pm-10m, and then come to me at 7pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close, at 2am. I did this without complaint, and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under 18 working past midnight.

I had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance. I was promised that I would have it off with no issue. Lo and behold, I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday. I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend, so I would just have to work. I went to the GM, who told me there was nothing he could do. I had to find someone to cover both shifts. Of course, not a single person was willing to take my shifts. Even though I'd taken at least 3 shifts for each of them. I went back to the GM who told me, ""It's not my problem. I don't care.""

Defeated, I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled. I was so sick of being treated like complete shit, of being talked down to and taken advantage of. It was then that I decided my revenge. 

Cue to Saturday afternoon, 1:58 pm. I'm sitting comfortably in my PJs at home. The bowling alley, arcade, and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy. I called the food court and said I wouldn't be coming in. I'd quit. The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line. ""You can't quit now! It's the busiest night of the week! [Male coworker] is the only one we've got! [Food Court Manager] is out of town, and I know you couldn't find anyone else to work for you! What do you expect us to do?!"" I took a breath, steadied my voice and said, ""It's not my problem. I don't care, "" then hung up.",Two stories of Petty Revenge from my first job.,506

She runs a good part-time business and makes a tidy part-time profit.

So last Monday, she's at a busy intersection in town.  The lights are green, so off she goes, but the vehicles at the other side of the lights aren't moving.  She's trapped in her van in the middle of the intersection as the lights change again and she's blocking traffic.

It's completely her own fault.  She screwed up.  She should have checked ahead and made sure the way was clear.  She knows this.  How embarrassing.  She has to sit there cringing in the middle of the intersection waiting for the way to be clear so she can move.

I look over, there is a kid, about 8-9 who is throwing a screaming fit because he wanted some dog toy. This continues through out the whole store. Kid sees hamsters, can't have one, 5 minute tantrum. Kid sees turtles... you get the idea. 

I'm a little miffed that my nice quiet errand has been blasted by a brat. My 4 year old doesn't behave like that in the store, WTF is a 8-9 year old doing it for? My luck, I get behind them in the checkout line. 

This particular Petco has a bar full of self serve treats. They all look like cookies, and some smell really good. Bratty kid asks his dad for cookies. The dad says no. I watch as this kid shoves 3 or 4 of the cookies in his mouth when his dad wasn't looking. 

Now, I *COULD* have said, ""sir, I just saw your son put dog biscuits in his mouth..."" But I didn't. I waited until that little shit had chewed them up, really good. Just as he was about to swallow them I pipe up, ""Excuse me, I think your kid just ate a dog treat."" 

Kid spits it out yelling about how he was eating dog food. He's scraping his tongue, begging for some water. Of course, there is no water for sale in the store so he had to wait to rinse his mouth out...

YesYouCannot,103,121,1r7zub,427,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

lessthanthreesquared,23,74,1qzcxw,276,"A friend and I were traveling together, but had been assigned an aisle and window seat. We were hoping no one would be seated between us, but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left. My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seat—he said, ""sure!"" and started to get up, but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats, he refused politely and sat back down. Weird, but no big deal. We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments, so this guy's own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed us.

Generally, I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway: full reign of the armrest, keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum (air, lights, etc). He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area, and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones, but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough, and I figured I'd only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff. I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat, turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to, and settled in. Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff, and I thought it would be the end of that.

Once we were in the air, though, he threw his jacket over himself, spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friend's seat, and both of us kept handing back his sleeves, asking him to be more careful. He'd make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space, but every time he shifted it would happen again. I later found out he had also used my friend's armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels weren't changing, but when he was asked to stop did he apologize? Of course not. He was just generally a clueless idiot.

Here's the thing: clueless idiot thing aside, he *really wasn't that bad.* Until...

My personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably, and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air. He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window, so once I caught on to that, I shut it for the rest of the flight ""so I could sleep."" Thing is, I like to see the lights in the city when we land, so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend: I knew he would enjoy the show, but I, too, wanted to see the lights, and I felt an opportunity for petty revenge.

So I opened the window, and he jumped into action, craning his neck, moving his elbows into my space, trying to see better. So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best ""Wow, this is AMAZING"" face at my friend. Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us, but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing strip—too late. I leaned back in my seat, affecting his view of the other window, and shut my own window pointedly.

When we got off the plane, we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky, and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways. I could only grin.

Td8981,9,59,1qvg0w,270,"Just found this subreddit, and I just had to add on one of my own from a few weeks back.

I work in a pretty popular toy store in the mall, and for Halloween all the kids come around to trick or treat. Had two kids run up past the line, push the other kids out of the way, and then grab me to get some candy. I told them to wait their turn, and they stepped back, then pushed in front of the next kid. Parents are standing there smiling at them the whole time.

My patience has evaporated by this point, so I told them to hold up their bags, and I reached in like I was dropping in a piece of candy. In actuality, I stole a handful of candy from both of them, and gave it to the kids behind they'd pushed in front of.

You know how people don't get personal space and decide to push their cart THISCLOSE when you're in line? The lady behind me was like that. Maybe it was because I was giving the person in front of me enough room. Like a good citizen.

Anyhow, I'm bagging my own groceries and chatting with the cashier. Lady behind me pushes her cart toward me. I give her *the look* but she ignores me.

The cart comes further, and she's actually pushing the damn thing into me. I sigh loudly, in an attempt to point out, umm, I'm standing here. YOU CAN WAIT THIRTY GODDAMNED SECONDS TO PUSH YOUR CART HERE.

Nope. Nothing. She knows what she's doing. She just looks at me in that, ""I know what I'm doing but I also know you won't do anything about it"" look. I don't know what the fuck her problem is.

I scoot the front of the cart behind me for a little more room. She takes this as an invitation to CONTINUE PUSHING HER FUCKING CART INTO ME. At this point, the cart is halfway into the walkway and I'm squeezed between it and the counter. What in the actual fuck.

I still have to pay, but the cart is preventing me from reaching the credit card reader. I grab it and swing it full out into the walkway. I swipe my card and finish the transaction. As I'm walking out, I push the cart even further away from her.

The look on her face was priceless. It was the face of an entitled bitch who never got her shit taken from her.

babiesonacid,18,52,1r53lr,216,"I'm a teller for a financial institution. We have an automatic coin machine in the front lobby available for members (and non-members) to use.

My schedule includes every Saturday morning, and Saturdays are what I call ""coin days"". I'd say that 85% of transactions I do on Saturdays are cashing in coin tickets. No biggie, it's really easy and I anticipate the break from the 'normal' stuff.

Two weekends ago, the coin machine was busier than usual - always at least one or two people waiting to use it. A member comes in, sees there is someone using the coin machine, and decides to come to my teller window. He has a smug look on his face and a [mega jug](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ln0cac1q331qzwowd.jpg) in his hands. I greet him as I would any other member: ""Hi there, what can I do for ya?"" He slams the mega jug on the counter, which is full of change, smirks, and says in the most despicable tone: ""Have fun"".

I took a deep breath.. ""No, sir. We do have another branch with a coin machine on (street) that you can take it to, if you'd like.""

""Listen, I don't have time to drive all over town just to get my money. I want you to take my change to the back and count it out for me, and I want my cash in return.""

I should mention that, if this were any other day and a member had presented me with a not-so-ridiculous amount of change, then I'd have no problem counting it out for them.

wellingtonbear,27,44,1qzeqs,211,"I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at Officemax.

I worked the furniture department, and on all the desks, chairs, etc, I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department.  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didn't want the number of tags to match the actual inventory (we could order an item if we were out of stock) and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk.   I'd print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didn't actually buy.

So one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store.  Yelling, screaming, picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines, taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor, etc.  Just being a general terror, and the parents just completely ignoring her.

A different customer came in and bought a desk, so I went to the back and found the item, loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them.   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center, and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door.  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it, they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture, so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside, and they'd naturally continue to the next door.

I saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open.  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor.  As I was walking to where the switch was, that's when I saw it.. the brat was running out to meet her father, and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department.  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept, she threw them up into the air like confetti.

She ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad.  I was flabbergasted, and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit, sort them out, and find the appropriate desks.  Since the parents obviously didn't give a shit, all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldn't get back in.

Then it happened.  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it, and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register.  She stood up and yelled, ""mommy!"" and darted towards the door, which had just started to close.  With the censor off, it was not stopping as she approached.  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed, pinning it up against the door jamb.  

She immediately tried to fall, but for a good second and a half, the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled, then the door opened because it was obstructed, and dropped her right on her face.

FredFltStn,6,84,1qv0xv,204,"**BACKGROUND:**  This is a story from my Food &amp; Beverage/Retail management days at a large entertainment/theme park company.

**STORY:**  Years ago, my friend and I were both supervisors for a large entertainment/theme park company in Orlando. We both worked evenings (different locations), and would usually hit the bars for a properly chilled adult beverage after work. This was before everyone carried a cell phone, and because of our jobs, we were required to be available by phone anytime if someone needed to reach us. Sadly, they knew to call be bar if it was before closing time.

Eventually, I was moved to the early morning shift. Since my then wife also worked mornings, this was definitely better for us (but I REALLY missed closing down the bars with my buddies). After I started working mornings, my friend started to prank call my house. The calls usually came around 3am, after he had finished work and was enjoying the nightlife. Occasionally, I’d be serenaded by a drunken group still in full swing at the bar. 

After the calls, I’d inevitably have to listen to 20 minutes of bitching about my drunken asshole friends. One day, after receiving three drunken calls the night before, I finally snapped. Before I went to bed, I called one of my employees and told him that once they had closed (usually around midnight), he needed to forward all of the location phones, and I gave him my friends home phone number.

As I understand it, the calls started coming in around 4am, and the phone basically didn’t stop ringing until I removed the call forwarding, about 4 hours later. His wife was not pleased. Amazingly, the drunk dialing stopped that day.

dr_gigglefarts,10,37,1r1mlk,202,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper. Woops.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",239

They replaced a dance troop with a new lot.

One of them went to school with my girlfriend, now wife, she told me of her bullying and arrogance and how she made her live a bit more miserable than it should have been. A few others also suffered. I went to the same school and never noticed just how bad she was, but being a studious kid and two years older I never hung with that crowd.   

When I got to the studio that changed. The dancer recognized me and thinking I was a audience member and said some thing along the lines of ""Hi there, fancy seeing you here. I'm a performing here you know, I might get you into the green room later, you can collect autographs"" that's not a bad thing to say but it was said with was a certain tone of voice and twist of her lip that irritated and I suppose my wife had primed me to dislike her.

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect.

Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools.

gtrmu223,32,57,1qrq75,175,"I posted this to tales from retail originally, but they don't want it because I guess unless you're bitching about customers or fellow employees, they don't care. Whatever.


To start, I work for a major retailer that is known for very low prices and treating their employees like crap. You can figure out which one. I started there in the electronics department in June. In September I was transferred to the wireless department due to 3 people leaving from there in a 7 day time frame. This made me happy because it's not as busy up there and I like working with phones. Most of the time though you just get paid to sit around and do nothing. That'll make anyone happy!

Anyway shortly after I was moved up there electronics got a new assistant manager over the department. The person who was above it is still working at the same store, just over a different department. The old one was someone who actually listened to the associates and did what he could to fix their concerns. The new one just sees customers as dollar signs and when she gets a customer complaint, she berates the employee without listening to their side of the story. I had 3 complaints in 2 weeks since she's been there, but not one when the other guy was over the department. Needless to say her and I don't get along.

Now, our department manager used to be a fair person. She left for 2 months because she had blood clots in her legs. Since she's been back, she's been a different person. Very strict, very dictator like. I don't know if it has anything to do with the new assistant manager, but I wouldn't doubt it if it did.

Anyway enough back story. For the last month they've been fucking with my hours. There's usually 3 shifts for wireless in my store: opener, mid shift, and closer. It seems like whenever I'm scheduled for one of these shifts, and there's a second one scheduled, when they come in I always get sent back to electronics. Which is all and fine, but wireless hours are not as long as electronics hours. Not to mention they get mad at me for not completing my work despite the fact that I have to cover the breaks and lunch of whoever is in wireless. Classic case of overworked and underpaid. And let's not forget my hours have gone down to the point where I only have 25 hours a week now. Lucky if I ever see 28, VERY lucky if I ever see 35.

Here's the revenge part: This past Monday I got called by the place I first interviewed at when I moved to where I am now last December. I re applied and they want to interview me again. So I go, and 3 and a half hours after I interview they're offering me the job, which I immediately accept. The biggest reason? True full time hours (40 hours, not the retarded retail definition of full time), benefits, every Sunday off with another day during the week. I would've been an idiot not to accept it.

So I walked into my current work on Wednesday and gave them my notice, which was a satisfying feeling itself. What was even more satisfying was when the manager asked what my last day would be when I was putting my notice in writing. You should've seen the look on his face when I told him it would be the day before Thanksgiving. That is my ultimate revenge to them. You treat me like shit and screw me over? I will screw you right back.

While they're all forced to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday, I'll be enjoying dinner with my girlfriend's family and have a nice long weekend to rest and prepare for my new job on December 2nd.
Score one for the little guy!

TL;DR: My work fucks me over on hours. I retaliate by getting a full time job and making my last day the day before Thanksgiving so I don't have to work that day and Black Friday.

So, my mom's been bugging me to take her to see Catching Fire (the sequel to the Hunger Games), I'd never even seen the first, but I agreed, watched The Hunger Games, and picked her up and took her to the movies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm such a good boy.).

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

They don't. They get more and more obnoxious every 10 minutes, and I have turned around and told them to be quiet (nicely), someone several chairs DOWN from me yells for them to be quiet, and someone a couple rows BACK asks them to be quiet.

I give it one more ""**Shut. Up.**"", to no avail.

....and then it fucking happens. Problem number 3: I zone out for 10 fucking seconds thinking ""JUST SHUT UP!"", miss some huge announcement in the movie, and I'm **lost**. I have no idea what just happened, or why the music got all sad, or what was just said.

I don't get mad easily, but I'm pretty god damn mad at this point. I briskly jog to the managers desk and I simply say

&gt; ""Look, I missed a huge plot point because of these guys. They shut up briefly, and then resume talking. I'm missing even more of the action right now. You will come tell them to be quiet, and 5 minutes later, they'll resume again. Please, don't make me come back out here.

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

LochnessLurky,13,50,1r0cz0,141,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service.

Redsnork,9,28,1r3gpz,135,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,163
semen_hurricane,24,30,1qx2lb,103,"TL; DR:  Gay porn boomerangs

This is a little more ""fun"" than most posts on here as it contains no real malice or anger, but I think it's funny nonetheless.

I had a roommate in college, let's call him Bob.  Bob's a great guy and we got along great, living together for about 3 years in college.  For various reasons, I moved around a lot after college and ended up moving back in with Bob for about a year and a half.

During this time, Bob decided to start messing with my computer.  Bob is a bit of prankster by nature.  Mostly it was minor stuff that was mildly annoying (picking the bathroom lock and pouring cold water on me in the shower, hiding and trying to scare the shit out of me when I come around a corner, etc).  I am really not prankster, but I will only take so much before I get revenge.

Bob wasn't great with computers beyond the basics like web surfing, typing, etc, but I think I know the day that he learned out how to change desktop backgrounds because I came into my room to find a naked dude, hand on his manhood, as my desktop background.  Bob was hiding out and giggled when he saw me discover the prank.  I rolled my eyes, changed the background back, and did what I needed to do on my computer.  I probably should have set a password on my computer at this point, but who wants to do that?

Anyway, I come back later in the day to find the same picture as my background.  Bob laughs.  I change it back again, silently making a note to think of a revenge plan.

Bob traveled a fair amount for his work, but it did not always require his work laptop, so he often left it at home.  Shortly after I found a naked dude as my background, he went out of town for work and I had decided how I was going to get revenge.

I opened up his laptop to discover he had set a password.  His girlfriend (who also lived with us) happened to be around and she helpfully gave me the password (she did her best to stay out of our pranks on one another so she assumed she could avoid blowback by helping me) and I set about doing the deed.

Cut to a couple days later when Bob comes home.  He opens up his laptop and clicks on IE to do some surfing.  A gay porn video immediately starts and I start laughing.  He scowls at me and says sarcastically something to the effect of ""that's funny"" and then tries to open IE again.  Same result.  

He tries various other shortcuts on his desktop only to find that I have helpfully reset all of his shortcuts to point at the gay porn video that I had downloaded and hidden on his hard drive.  After watching the first few seconds of the video the fourth time, he starts whining about it being his work computer and how I need to fix it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't want to get into trouble.

Being the nice guy I am, I fix it.  He didn't mess with my computer again.  And I think he was annoyed with his girlfriend for throwing him under the bus.  Not my problem.

gotcatstyle,6,21,1qu754,101,"I work part time at a restaurant. There's this one regular, ""Earl,"" who's a dude in his 60s-70s and is clearly of the mind that because he's a regular he does not need to consort with the lowly waitstaff. He's very friendly and chatty with the manager, who's been working there for years. However, my typical interactions with Earl go as follows:

*enter Earl*

Oscar_Says_Jack-Ass,16,25,1qsv0a,97,"About two weeks ago, we lost 2 chickens to raccoons.  We had not had any issues with animals in several months and so I got a bit lax when it came to locking up the chickens at night.  Unfortunately, two of our best layers were killed.

Last night I went to lock the chickens up, but it was already dark outside so I really couldn't see into the coop.  I noticed that one of the chickens looked like it was not on its normal roost so I went and got a light to investigate further.
Well, I discovered that there was a raccoon hiding out in one of the nesting boxes, so I set a trap at the entrance to the coop and after some yelling and banging, I was able to get the raccoon to run out and into the trap.

By this time, I was feeling pretty smug.  I had trapped the stinky, murderous raccoon, and was deciding its fate.  It was being pretty aggressive and I decided to take my flashlight and give the raccoon a poke (it's pretty small and fit between the wires of the cage).  Well, the raccoon was having none of that, and it bit the end of the light and pulled it into the cage.  Of course, at this time I was pissed that the dumb raccoon was going to waste my batteries because I certainly wasn't going to be able to get the light back until the morning when it was time to evict the critter.

This morning I went out and discovered that in his act of petty revenge, the raccoon had completely destroyed the flashlight.  There were a few chunks strewn about the cage and I found the batteries and the bulb.  I'm not positive, but I think the raccoon had a little smirk on its face...

marvin,11,20,1r3fov,96,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

just_a_spoonful,7,33,1r7pgf,93,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

She tries to stuff it under the seat but unfortunately it didn't fit so she just left it in the aisle. For the first half of the ride she played Candy Crush quietly on her tablet which was fine by me but the second half of the ride she got a phone call and then proceeded to bitch at the other person on the end. She was really loud and complaining that whatever she was being asked to do and how she was studying and it stressed her out yada yada

What was she complaining about? About feeding chickens, about how she wanted a new chicken coop and that no one was feeding her chickens. She was yelling at the other person about how they're lazy and all they do is go to work and eat. She kept going in circles about how it stressed her out and how she wanted to speak to her mother. People sitting around us were also staring and shaking their heads. I usually nap during my bus rides but she was too loud and moved while she spoke.

When we arrived I was finally happy to be able to go home but she proceeds to go through her texts on her phone and her bag is blocking the aisle and people behind us can't get off. She's so absorbed in her texts that people saying excuse me and trying to shuffle past her bag didn't phase her.

I wanted to tell her to move the fuck out of my way but then I decided to get petty. My book bag was on my lap the entire ride so I moved my book bag with as much force I could muster after a cramped 2 hour bus ride towards the my left side where she was sitting.

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us.

The last time I flew was around a year ago from Atlanta to Memphis. I know, almost not a real flight; you spent more time being groped than actually in the air. Whatever. 

Anyway, I'm 6'3""+ and about 280-290 lbs, with a football lineman build. I'm also black, remember this part. 

We start flying, blah blah. I've got my music going, I'm knee-deep into the seat before me, and the dude in front of me starts trying to push his seat back. I say trying because it failed each time, and I was just sitting there. 

I felt bad for the guy at first since he probably wanted to relax and nap. That sentiment lasted until he started pounding my knees vigorously by means of plane seat, as if it'd help him bust a quickie. I heard him mutter something about entitled fat black people, and then he started back again. 

Now I'll never be skinny, and never have been. But I feel like I look decent; got some fat and some muscle, and it's like that (and that's the way it is. Unh!). For the black part, I'm pretty sure entitlement is rather separate from race. After the umpteenth time, I readjusted myself, ensuring he could go nowhere. I heard his frustation.

bassboyjoe,12,15,1r3dao,70,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

A friend, lets call her Jane, comes up to me and she looks a bit upset and fairly pissed off. I ask what's up and Jane tells me that some guy had just been talking to his friends and essentially told them that he had gotten with her one time, clearly trying to impress them.

This never happened, she doesn't know the guy, none of my mates with me there did either.

So she asks me if I wouldn't mind just pretending to be her boyfriend and having a chat with him. I'm pretty pissed off with what this dick's been saying so I think I'll go have a talk. I'm not a confrontational person, I always try to defuse situations, I'm not the sort of guy to go over and smack him in the face; but honestly I was angry enough that if refused I was ready to threaten him at the very least.

In any case, this guy could probably take me on, if you look at it from the logic of a bigger drunk guy. But as soon as I say those words the guy pales, goes completely still and starts stammering out an apology and takes back everything he said.

And man it felt so good seeing him shit himself like that, almost felt sorry for the dickhead.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off. This Jeep now comes barreling down the street as I was halfway over the crosswwalk. They honked the horn at me a bunch of times, banged on the windows and (in the few seconds it took them to drive by) were just general asshats. 

Normally I wouldn't give a fuck but after a long ass day I was tired and my bullshit tolerences were at an all time low. I would have just carried on my merry way home, longingly thinking of the warm shower and hot food that awaited me. 

But no.

They had turned around to come back my way to do it all over again. It being honking and yelling and banging. Again.

Yes the gross orange one that those twatwaffles had been in.

Ambrosia1989,14,22,1qxcii,65,"This story is barely a thing, but I amused myself a lot with it.

I was going to the grocery store just for a quick purchase. In the parking lot, parked in front of me, I spotted a white car who's parked on two parking spots (the like between the two was going almost perfectly under the middle of the car). I saw cars parking like that often, but this time, it was grinding my gears at the highest point. 

My first idea was to leave a note saying ""You park like an asshole"" and leave, but I was out of paper. I was about to give up my plan until I had an idea. I took a picture of the licence plate and went to a cashier inside the grocery store. I told the cashier that I saw a tow truck around the car, like it was about to tow it, and that I guessed that it was because of the way it was parked (I thought about it, I wanted the owner to know somehow) And then, I go to make my purchase.

Less than a minute after (I told you guys it was a QUICK purchase), I go back to the cashier and pay for my purchase. Since it was the same one I saw a minute before, she starts giving me updates on the car situation, letting me know that everything was okay, no tow truck was there anymore. The cashier even pointed me who was the vehicle owner. 

Cashier : There was no tow truck you told me, right?

Owner : Nope. None. I guess it was okay, kind of a false alarm.

Me : Well, how disappointing. 

And then I left while both the cashier and the car owner didn't seem to understand what was going on. Back to my car, I saw that the asshole parked her car correctly.

There are several towers, and I live in the smallest and farthest tower, which also is the least occupied, so the parking around my tower entrance generally isn't a problem. 

However, the complex's A/C machinery is right up against the spots for the tower, so it can be difficult to open your driver door if someone parks too close to the line. 

This douche with a Cayenne GTS has been making it difficult to park the last week, so I've been waiting for the right amount of inches to pull this off. 

He parked today a little to close, but just enough for me to get out with no issues; however he won't be able to get in without figuring out which apartment my car belongs to and me pulling out.

The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

PurplePeduncles,9,20,1qzihb,59,"This happened at the store I worked in and didn't involve me, but I figured the story was worth telling. On my mobile so excuse formatting (and long text, I've put in a TL;DR)

I was hired as a sales assistant in a new branch of a large footwear company, along with several other new employees. The store opened a couple of weeks ago and, for the most part, the new team all get along and everyone is friendly. However, the new supervisor (let's call him Pete) had already shown himself to be... not exactly the best supervisor. Put briefly, he got into arguments with the manager of the store that he trained in, childishly complained that he wanted to go home one evening when everyone was staying up late getting the shop set-up, and then disappeared without telling anyone when he was told that he needed to stay, and generally did not follow instructions or act professionally in store. 

On one of these occasions, our area manager was visiting, and this pretty much resulted in her telling our manager (we'll call her Amy) to ""get rid of him"". His next shift comes around, and he is called into the office for a 'meeting', and (even though our manager didn't want to as she has always gotten along with him) he is fired on the spot.

However, this wasn't the end of it for Pete.

First, he put in an appeal to get his job back. Fair enough, but seeing as the area manager herself told Amy to fire him, chances of that were slim.

A few days later, we spot Pete and his girlfriend walking around the shopping centre. You have to get a bus out to where we are, so everyone thinks this is a bit odd, but brushes it off. Later on his girlfriend walks into the shop, looks around, then leaves. No big deal. Until, that is, we're cleaning up and we find the notice for his replacement screwed up into a little ball and stuffed into a shoe. Very professional.

But wait, there's more. A little while after we find the notice, an angry-looking guy in his 40s strides up to me, and demands that he talk to the manager, naming her, saying they ""need a private chat"". He refuses to give a name. Amy comes out, and he insists they go into the stock room to talk. Fast forward a little bit, he leaves, and Amy reveals that the mystery man was none other than Pete's dad (Pete is 18 but has moved in with his girlfriend) who has demanded to know why his son had been fired because he was being blamed for something my assistant manager mistakenly did a few days prior (long story short, if you're going to comment on customers, wait until they've left the store and can't hear you...). Pete's dad threatens Amy with solicitors and appeals, but after explaining why Pete had actually been fired, he looks pretty embarrassed and left.

We figured it would end there, but nope, he had one last stunt to pull. Amy used to be the assistant manager in another store in the shopping centre we're in, and is still in contact with her old colleagues. A couple of days ago, she gets a text from one of them saying 'I've had someone called Pete hand in a CV today saying ""This is to replace Amy"" '. Reeeeal mature.

His appeal hearing is this Friday with our area manager, who has been made aware everything that has gone on. In this case, I really don't think any amount of petty revenge will help him get his job back.


TL;DR - Supervisor lost his job, appealed for wrongful dismissal, then ripped down the ad for his replacement and left it in the shop, sent his dad in to shout and my manager, then applied to 'replace' my manager's place at her previous job. Before his appeal.

Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

I work as a Data Entry/Computer Tech guy for my dad's oil lab. We do various fuel testing, oil analysis and such for vehicle engines, fuel depots and our local air base and airport. Not the best job in the world but it pays the bills with a decent amount left over for fun money.

Now, there is one particular co-worker of mine, who as of late, has had a major stick up his ass and for the life of me I cannot figure out why. He always seems to be groaning or complaining about something or other in the lab (i.e. it's too cold in the garage bay area; it's too hot in the lab area;, that kinda stuff) However, recently he has taken to talking nasty to one of my other co-workers behind my back in regards to how quickly I do my own work and get the sample data in the computers and then out into the lab technicians. The most recent one this morning was as follows:

""All he does is sit in there and fuck around on that god damned computer. Wish I could sit around and fuck off all day and get paid for it. Lazy fuck."" This is said out in the lab where he seems to forget sound rebounds and comes back into the front area where i work. I let it slide, as I don't need to worry about his grievances and just focus on my work. However, he didn't leave it be at that. Not ten minutes later as I am working on my second tray of samples for the morning, he comes in and snaps his fingers at me to go faster. ""get the lead out"", he has shit to do and wants off early. I grit my teeth and just continue on my way. But oh no my friends, I am not letting this slide.

After he leaves work today, and up until the end of the year, I am going to snap the pencil lead in all of his pencils at his work station, making it so he has to sharpen his pencils first thing every day for the rest of the year. Who needs to get the lead out now, Mr. Complains-a-lot?

* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

biddoodles,11,14,1qqyob,37,"**The Preface:**
So I work in a locally owned Italian restaurant as a server and have been there over a year. I've proven to my bosses and managers that I can handle my own sections, etc. Fridays are normally our busiest nights as we have a list of reservations and just as many walk-ins. On this particular night I'm given the back section, which contains two 6-tops, two 4-tops, and one 2-top.(#-tops is how many people a table can seat for those unfamiliar) The back section is also right beside Dishland and the bus room where we dump our dirty dishes. Alright, enough preface. Onto the revenge.

**The Setup:**
I'm in the back section tonight and I get sat back-to-back, so my section fills up quickly. I'm basically in catch-up mode at this point trying to meet all the demands of my tables. A family of 6 walks in and sits at my table. The head of the table, lets refer to him as Comb Over, takes it upon himself to hastily tell me they need their drinks and order taken asap. Normally, not a problem, but on a busy night, yeah bit of a problem. I'm rather busy already having been sat so quickly, and try and run around to get them their drinks and take their order. Not to mention, we're backed up in the kitchen because the orders are coming in out the ass. Go figure the entire table orders a different drink, so I have to prepare 5 separate drinks. I take their order and they want something changed in every item they order, sauce on side, light sauce, they want something substituted, yadda yadda. Basically every server's pain in the ass group.

**The Annoyance:**
CO decides to be a big shot tonight and flag me down every time someone at his table needs something instead of waiting 5 minutes for me to come around. CO stops me for every little thing so I can't get all of these things in bulk. Need a new fork because CO dropped his, need more water, a 2nd and 3rd Shirley Temple, want more coffee, more sugar, more water, creamer, this that, Ugh! They're chugging their drinks like fucking camels too and I still have 4 other tables I'm trying to keep happy as well. I counted up in my head and CO stopped me about 16 times, all before they even get their entree(approx 25 mins) and I'm fed up. I'm trying to clear dishes off of one table and CO stops me yet again, hands full of dirty dishes, to get him more coffee creamer. I say I will and walk past him to dump the dishes off in the bus room beside them. I come back empty handed and CO locks eyes with me, probably assuming I had forgotten and throws his hands in the air with a look of irritation. I walk by him on my way to the kitchen pissed at this point and grab a water for another table and a hand full of fucking creamer. I walk right out and slam down the handful of creamer and strut off.

**The Revenge:**
Just after that, their food shows up. I walk back and pass it out, asking if they need anything else. Surprise surprise, not a single person has something they need and no one will make eye contact with me. I walk off to tend to my other tables and ignore them until the end of the meal. I see that they have 2 coupons out and i walk over to take care of them, them only talking enough to explain which dish to put on which check. A smirk hits my face because with coupons I get to add gratuity (it's stated on the bottom of the coupon so they know this before they use it). I run their cards and sneak off to the kitchen and return with another coffee creamer. With a huge forced grin and the fakest 'Thanks for coming' I could muster, I pass out both checks and for CO's check I place a lovely coffee creamer on the top of the ticket.

I wanted to laugh so hard when I went back and smirked to myself in the kitchen.

Needless to say they complained that I was the worst server they've ever had. My manager understood how they were so I didn't get in trouble.

Then plane takes off and we can now readjust our seats and play with our electronics. Remember when we had to turn off our electronic before take off. Kids have it easy! Anyways, my seat does not push back. I'm like, what the fuck! I keep pushing back and nothing. So I'm pissed, but I don't complain to the flight attendants. I start to gaze out my window, and at the corner of my eye I see this asshole behind me holding the seat forward so that I can't tilt it back. I'm furious because I wanted to catch zzz on the flight. But I don't want to make a scene. I get up to go to the restroom and I see this 6ft. 280lb dude grinning from the corner or my eye. I'm even more pissed! I come back and I accept the situation. We'll not to long after my friend needs to go to the restroom. Unfortunately for him no one can push my seat forward anymore. So I pushed my seat all the way back on him.

I also work with five other guys from another company that like to fool around a lot. I'm always game for some shenanigans, so long as I am aware of it. Well, this morning I get to work and start getting ready to move some equipment, so I go to grab my rope, where a scene of pure horror met my eyes. My ~50ft rope is now about 3 feet long and FULL of knots. Even Alexander the Great would have given pause looking at this thing. There were so many knots it took me 20 minutes to finally get it untangled. But it didn't end there. Every time it would turn my back throughout the day, I'd come back to find at least 2 or 3 knots in it again. It was even braided at one point!

It took me all day to try and find something to do to get back at them (This is a dangerous area in the middle of nowhere so it couldn't be anything unsafe or risk damaging equipment).Finally it hit me as I was leaving: they had some sodas in their trailer!

jayriley,11,7,1r1cso,34,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass.

I made my own submission to the contest today, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSeR5wrQUU8), giving what I think to be a pretty good tour of my apartment.

I'd have had nicer stuff in my apartment, but both last year and the year before that when they were doing move-outs for the roommates that were not staying (we each rent only our rooms, and it's a 4 room apartment) the service people they sent in to clean the apartments did not perform as admirably as desired. 

The first year, they came into my locked room and completely trashed up the place, throwing all my belongings on the ground in the center of the room so they could paint it. Apparently they thought that my room was an abandoned apartment or something. Several things were damaged, but the apartment complex apologized and later paid for the damages to some of my belongings.

The very next year, during the same time when move-outs were happening, they left my door unlocked and several of my personal belongings were stolen. Nothing came of that however.

aub51zzz,18,26,1qy3oa,21,"**Some brief background info:** 
I worked for a couple of years during high school at a fast food chain that served only fried chicken fingers and a few sides that were not exactly the healthiest. By no means is our food unhealthy enough to cause heart problems, but we are not exactly a ""health food"" restaurant. Our menu is small and somewhat limited, but people enjoy coming to our restaurant and enjoy our food. 

**The story:** 
It’s a slow day, and I am enjoying the shift working the drive-thru. When we are not as busy, it is easier for me to strike up conversation with our customers, and being able to talk to some of them really brightens my day. Of course, there are always a few exceptions. But I am having a fairly good day. 

At one point, a car pulls up to the speaker to order food. After saluting her with a suger-coated greeting, the customer speaks. “Hi, yes… Ummm… Do you have grilled chicken?”

It is not an uncommon request, but it is also one I am unable to fulfill. I regretfully respond, ""I apologize, ma'am, we only serve our chicken fingers fried.""

The woman gasps as if her life were just threatened. ""*What?!* So you only serve fried chicken?""

""Yes, ma'am, only fried,"" I reiterated. 

I can hear her chuckling over the headset. ""Well, it seems to me that you have no concern for those living a *healthy* lifestyle."" (Note: this is a **fast food** place.) 

""I can offer you unsalted fries as well as toast without the butter,"" I reply, doing my best to be helpful even though this lady seems pretentious. “For drinks, we also have-”

The customer interrupts me with a sound of pure disgust. “No. I don’t want your… your… Ugh.” She apparently does not have the right vocabulary in her mental arsenal to describe the food that repulsed her so.  “I just want a large diet soda.” 

This confused me slightly; I wouldn’t imagine a woman who seems to be a “health nut” to order any kind of soda. Maybe she was simply counting calories, but to me it was counter-intuitive to her previous disgust. 

She pulls to my window and paid for her 32oz drink, her angry, glaring eyes set fixedly on me. I hand her the soda, and before I could say another word the woman speeds off, obviously still perturbed. I am not too bothered, and the shift continues as usual. 

**The (*petty*) revenge:** Little did she know, I filled half of her drink with her requested diet soda, and the other half with regular. 

Enjoy the calories, bitch.



Edit: If I would have believed my revenge to be dangerous, I would not have done so. I have had gluten allergies brought to my attention, and I feel awful when there isn't really anything I can do. But this woman was obviously concerned for her health, which means she should go out to a fast food place. 

Also, diet soda is worse for you than regular. It just has less calories and less sugar. 

So to those of you claiming this was dangerous - I assure you it was not. This was a rare instance when I enacted petty revenge on a customer (I don't spit in food because that's sick.) 

But I will be filling a soda with half water or seltzer next time... That's genius!!

Morkant,7,23,1qr3bn,21,"So a few years back I worked at a fast-food restaurant in Canada. As an employee there I was required to work drive-thru on occasion which meant serving hundreds of people their food over the course of my shift. 


With hundreds of people coming through. And my shifts being later in the day (4-11 being the most common) I would try and be smiling and upbeat for every customer that came through. But sometimes you get that one that's so rude, you just need to stand up for yourself somehow.


So I'm working the drive-thru, it's mid-evening, about 7-8 o'clock and the rush has died down. The store is fairly empty and there's only a few of us left working (night shift doesn't get in until 10:30). I hear a beep at my headpiece and I answer a middle aged man's call for a pair of donuts. 


Grabbing the donuts I quickly trotted over to the drive-thru window and took his money whilst handing him his donuts in a little paper baggy. Thinking that was the end of it I smiled at him, and turned to resume mopping the floor as he drove off. 10 seconds later I hear a voice through the window (I'd left it open) and see the man is back. He'd reversed back into the drive-thru, only to end up a good 10 feet away from the window. Yelling angrily about how I'd gotten the wrong donuts he proceeded to throw the donuts (still in baggy) at full force through the window, forcing me to snatch them out of mid air before they hit the wall and went everywhere.


I don't think I made a mistake with his order, and either way company policy said I was going to replace it anyways, but there was no reason for him to be such an ass about it. Throwing away the old order, I went and got the 2 new donuts that he requested and walked back to the window to find him standing there, having gotten out of the car.

BNugget,0,5,1r8juf,34,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!).

I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy.

Familiarity breeds contempt, and I like to say that our friendship is built on a mutual hate. We argue, mock, and generally fuck with each other all the time but it rarely becomes heated enough to start a real fight. 

Well for whatever reason sometime last spring we fought over something and it became physical with me slapping him then being tackled by him. We were separated by mutual friends then went back to our own rooms to cool off.

Right before leaving for dinner I made sure to be the last one out of the room and got the device out of my bag, turned it on, and his it under the radiator. After dinner we came back up to his room to play some Mario Kart.  Now at random intervals the device began to make high pitched beeping and buzzing sounds.  After a while everyone else in the room began to wonder what it was and started to look for it, but to no avail.  There were roughly 2 months left of school before summer break at this point and we would hang out in his room almost daily because he didn't have a roommate (no one had to get caught in the cross fire).  He quickly became infuriated at the beeping and buzzing and at least once dragged his mattress out to the lounge so he could sleep. He tore apart his room on multiple occasions looking for the source and even considered calling housing to see if they could fix the problem. The whole time I was really enjoying myself.  I was slowly driving him insane. In the end I mentioned it to one of our other friends so he would stop looking for the source, but he ended up ratting me out at the end of the year.

AnoruleA,16,20,1r6kqx,20,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,40

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,19,44,1r5ydj,20,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times. That what you get for keeping me up last week. I did it for me; I liked it.","""This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch!""",64
heykidsgetoffmylawn,2,13,1r3ko8,16,"Yes, I petty revenged my cat. Don't judge.


I was in the bathroom, doing the dookie pokey, and my cat kept meowing at me, even though his food bowl in the spare bedroom was full.   


Apparently, he wanted to eat his food in the bathroom, as this is where the food is stored, and must have wanted some peace and quiet whilst he ate. *I* wanted peace and quiet while I did my business, but I couldn't get it, as he wouldn't stop meowing at the door. My previous meal was several large burritos. You can picture the fumage. Fine. Two can play this game.

Once I had dropped a few friends off at the pool, I filled another cat food dish and placed it on the floor for the cat, and opened the door. The cat ran in, and started eating. I closed the door, thereby trapping the cat in the ass-scented room. 

Enjoy your dinner, kitty.

oohfriedrice,3,13,1qqwlg,16,"**TL;DR: Fedora Wearing Douche Canoe causes the One Act Drama productions to have a huge amount of drama, so I tell him his essay is perfect even though it is a piece of shit with no main idea that didn't respond to the writing prompt.**

The yearly student directed one act drama productions began with a shit load of drama. After each director auditions everyone, all the directors fight for who they want to cast because it is un-ideal to cast one person in multiple shows. There is an unspoken rule of seniority. Note the word ""unspoken"". Directors who have directed before and are seniors have seniority and basically are allowed to cast whoever they want. Seniority is then given based on age, so if a senior director and junior director have a conflict over casting, the senior director gets who they want. Due to the dearth of males in drama, it was a fight to the death to cast the male you wanted. 

There are six directors: Awesome Girls (AG) who have directed twice before and are seniors, Drama Club President (DCP), Fedora wearing Ass Hat (FDAH) who caused this conflict, Girl who tries to mediate everything and fails, me, and Young Jew Sophmore (YJS). FDAH and his co-director (a senior) wrote their own one act while AG got theirs online. 

AG and FDAH want to cast the same male as their lead, but FDAH disregards the fact that AG has SENIORITY over him claiming his one act is the most important. Though AG present a perfectly valid argument about how it is their last year directing, FDAH says this is not a valid argument and says he should get said male. After 10 minutes of steam escaping from multiple peoples' ears, FDAH says he has to leave and study for a math test the following day and write an essay due the following day. He also says that he is content with casting (DCP) as his lead, relinquishing his hold on the male he had first wanted to cast.

DCP posts potential cast list online for everyone to see, and FDAH says he is casting the male actor he had given away to AG because ""he had yet to hear an argument that has persuaded him"". The guy does not get the unspoken rule of seniority; he just cares about himself.The resulting conversation resulted in a GINORMOUS timesink of 82 minutes, and I'm only at home for 180 minutes before internet shuts off. 

He further went on to say he was going to ask said male whose one act he wants to be in, which a) informs male about our inner troubles and b) puts him between a rock and a hard space. In order to justify his action, FDAH said "" If &lt;actors name&gt; wants to be in both casts,fine, if not, such is life"", yah FDAH thanks for screwing us over. Being that now the cast lists are far from complete, DCP proposes another meeting the next day. YAY, more time wasted in result of FDAH.

Not ten minutes after posting that he was taking the male actor, FDAH asks me if I can edit his essay as we are in the same literature class. Analysis of quotes from the book was needed in this essay to prove if the book should be banned or not, but sadly, FDAH did not get this memo. He used quotes from other sources that did nothing to prove his point. I told him his essay was perfect and that he would get A even though he did actually complete the essay prompt and had several items in his essay on the automatic zero list.

Chahles88,9,14,1r2n67,16,"I took my younger siblings and my cousins to DQ. They got ice cream, I order one of their frozen coffee drinks. They didn't blend it enough, so there were pea sized ice chunks in it that would clog the straw every time I tried to take a sip. I brought it back and asked them to blend it some more, and showed them the chunks. 

The lady gets all huffy and says she SHOULD be charging me for another, because they can't put that one back into the machine since I drank from it. Instead we agree that she will just make me another one that is properly blended. 

She makes another one, but worse this time. Like you can SEE that it clearly isn't blended. I point this out. She says That's how its supposed to be. We argue. She's not budging and her coworkers would not help me either. It was undrinkable. Finally I give up. The kids are done with their ice cream and I don't need the extra sugar. I walked over to the table, pulled the top off my coffee abortion, and quickly tipped it upside down onto the table, such that everything was still in the cup, but would be impossible to clean without moving the cup and spilling it everywhere. The lady watched me do this. I'm not sorry.","Screw me once, That's fine. Screw me twice...My Dairy Queen adventure",30
