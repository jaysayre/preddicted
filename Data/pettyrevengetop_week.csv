daniellelasvegas,119,,394,1r28l6,,1337,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.





Edit: words",Almost push me onto the tracks? Good luck grabbing your desired seat.,1731,pettyrevenge

teuker,164,,426,1r5efr,,1066,"Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field. Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

""Firstname (she LOATHED being called anything except Dr. Lastname),

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

--Teuker""

I never saw her face after she got the emails (I've done this for the last two semesters!), but it warmed my heart to know that I was able to inconvenience her in just the smallest of ways.",Call me a misogynist? Good luck uploading your syllabus without me,1492,pettyrevenge
gottadance,115,,256,1r2c95,,1019,"My A-level biology teacher told me she refused to assign me a coursework project because I missed the lesson where the coursework was arranged. I had told her beforehand that I'd being absent to go to my brother's funeral. She shouted at me for 5 minutes, saying I wasn't her responsibility, that I didn't take my education seriously and I'd have to get zero for the coursework element which meant losing 20%. Every time I opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got angrier. I went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how she'd treated me and agreed I'd done nothing wrong. 

My biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that, so I swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers. She got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing. Even if I had got caught, the ensuing meltdown was well worth it. 

I started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so I told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work. She had to explain to the next teacher that he couldn't use one panel of the board because she used the wrong pens. She spent the entire lunch break getting it off.","Teacher shouts at me for going to my brother's funeral, I swap her pens for permanent markers.",1275,pettyrevenge
YourFederalOverlord,52,,215,1rg4z6,,814,"When I was in middle school, many years ago, I had a Digital Arts teacher who's job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly.  She did not do that at all, instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class.  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.  

It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page (though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly) and she never did end up going to the World Series.

YesYouCannot,204,,218,1r7zub,,734,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

Redsnork,61,,143,1r3jsq,,644,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

riotryan,49,,115,1rbgg4,,614,"This happened over 20 years ago, but it's probably my best example of petty revenge. I was 20 years old and worked at a fast food restaurant. It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

""And you didn't even want a free burger and fries?""

""No way. That food will kill you.""

So last Monday, she's at a busy intersection in town.  The lights are green, so off she goes, but the vehicles at the other side of the lights aren't moving.  She's trapped in her van in the middle of the intersection as the lights change again and she's blocking traffic.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

They don't. They get more and more obnoxious every 10 minutes, and I have turned around and told them to be quiet (nicely), someone several chairs DOWN from me yells for them to be quiet, and someone a couple rows BACK asks them to be quiet.

I give it one more ""**Shut. Up.**"", to no avail.

....and then it fucking happens. Problem number 3: I zone out for 10 fucking seconds thinking ""JUST SHUT UP!"", miss some huge announcement in the movie, and I'm **lost**. I have no idea what just happened, or why the music got all sad, or what was just said.

I don't get mad easily, but I'm pretty god damn mad at this point. I briskly jog to the managers desk and I simply say

&gt; ""Look, I missed a huge plot point because of these guys. They shut up briefly, and then resume talking. I'm missing even more of the action right now. You will come tell them to be quiet, and 5 minutes later, they'll resume again. Please, don't make me come back out here. I've already missed the excitement in the beginning of the movie, don't make me miss more.""

Sure enough, he comes in, shuts them up. Sure enough, they start talking again. 2 people beside me stand up and turn around, and before they can even say anything.... the manager is there with his hand up in true ""I've got this"" fashion, and escorts all the little chatter boxes out.

I walked out with a couple people (who were presumably going to concession), so no one knew of my heroic actions, but I will rest well knowing I avenged my fellow movie goers, anonymous or not. That applause when you little assholes got escorted out was for me, and I know it, and my momma knows it!

Oh and, if you talk in movies, **FUCK YOU**.","Please, don't make me come back out here.",282,pettyrevenge
dr_gigglefarts,10,,44,1r1mlk,,224,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper. Woops.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",268,pettyrevenge

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect. For the last week, it's been normal to expect  2-3 worksheet packets (overall 5-10 pages) and a quiz almost daily. Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools. Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.

So, this afternoon I find myself sitting behind this jackass and, lo and behold, he's chatting away like it's his living room.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

And surname name:

LovesEwoks,72,,66,1ri9iq,,386,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,50,1rbsaq,,189,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,178,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

Redsnork,9,,37,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,203,pettyrevenge

I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,151,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.

I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.

k-squid,13,,18,1ra14h,,137,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

Please be kind to your fellow theater patrons. :)",Revenge on annoying movie patrons.,155,pettyrevenge

I put these playlists on discs and exchange them with friends pretty frequently. A 2 and a half year relationship down the shitter prompted the creation of one such playlist which I then burned to a disc.

BNugget,7,,27,1r8juf,,128,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

She never said anything about it and even if she had, she had no bearing on my grade in the ""assistant"" class. ",Assistant Principal Gets Unwanted Calls,155,pettyrevenge

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,113,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant, while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the company's head researcher. Great evening. It's nice to be a grad student.",Insult me on my birthday three months ago? No free food for you.,137,pettyrevenge

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us.

Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us.

We reached a red light. We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us. We stopped far enough back that they couldn't do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gestures.

I didn't want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote (Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for, but am supposed to share. I recognize this flaw, and I do not care).

Cawkii,29,,24,1rdk0e,,91,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

bassboyjoe,16,,18,1r3dao,,89,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

jagadiosa,3,,29,1r18dk,,61,"I work for a very large company as an IT Field agent and was tasked with installing a new system for my company which had an office inside of an EXTREMELY large Tech company that makes (hint) Processors.  The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.  I felt bad for my friend who was innocent in all this, but I could not miss this chance to let this manager catch some of my shit for once.

crazypancakes,9,,22,1r4yhp,,58,"I am fully aware we bring this on ourselves, and the whole incident could be avoided if we are better at doing laundry, but here it is.

BACKSTORY: We have two kids; a two year old, and a seven month old. We both work, and haven't quite figured out how to balance looking after the kids and doing all the housework. We're doing OK, but there's always something that can be done; laundry specifically.

THE REVENGE: When my Mother-in-law looks after the kids, after the kids are asleep for nap time, my MIL will very kindly clean up a little bit and do laundry (very nice of her). However, whenever she puts our (my wife and I) laundry away, she ALWAYS puts it away in a place it doesn't go. At first, I put it down to the fact she doesn't live here, so probably has no idea which drawer we put things. But, I noticed that when she puts away underwear for example, even if I have a full drawer full of clean underwear, so it is pretty obvious that is its home, she will put my underwear with my shirts.

Takalak,3,,10,1r3707,,54,"Sweet, sweet, petty revenge! I'm posting over my phone for the first time, so I hope nothing goes wrong. 

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did. He stood up and I think he said excuse me, but I had earbuds in and pretended I couldn't hear him. I leaned forward in the universal ""I'm getting off at the upcoming stop"" position but I held off on actually getting up until the last minute, making him stand and wait. Ha!

Bitch-girl is sitting with her back to two of those windows, so around noon a lot of sun comes through and falls on her computer screen making it hard for her to see. So she has taken possession over those two windows stopping much of the sunlight from coming into the office (and limiting my view of the outside world, of which I long ever so much for).

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,42,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

jayriley,12,,12,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,26,1r6kqx,,30,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,56,pettyrevenge

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F.

Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times. That what you get for keeping me up last week. I did it for me; I liked it.","""This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch!""",90,pettyrevenge

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty.

So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

It's completely her own fault.  She screwed up.  She should have checked ahead and made sure the way was clear.  She knows this.  How embarrassing.  She has to sit there cringing in the middle of the intersection waiting for the way to be clear so she can move.

There's a man standing on the side of the road with his lovely wife.  He's outraged! ""STUPID BITCH!"" he yells.  His wife looks at him a little surprised.

My Mum the pensioner knows she screwed up.  There is currently nothing she can do to rectify the situation other than wait it out.  It's pretty embarrassing.

So she turns at looks at the outraged man and takes a big deep breath.  ""CUNT!"" she yells.

Man's wife looks startled, then starts giggling.  Man is apoplectic!  His eyebrows are going in all directions!  ""SHITHEAD!"" he yells.

""PRICK!"", Mum the pensioner yells back.

Wife is now openly laughing at her husband.  Husband is turning all sorts of colours then abruptly storms off.  Wife follows along snuffling and snorting and pausing only long enough to share a look of camaraderie with my Mum the pensioner.  Mum calmly drives off when the way is clear.

So we had to share a room and I didn't even like the chick. I was the angsty, artsy type and she was the prep.  We just clashed!
So, my parents refused to get me a stereo that had a CD player on it because they thought CDs were just a passing trend.  It just wasn't a logical birthday or christmas gift for me. I had finally saved up enough baby sitting money to buy my own stereo and I didn't want to share it with my sister.   I'd come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station.  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her.   
One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest.  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote, you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself.  It had to be unmuted by the remote control.  Once I figured this out, I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it.",Took the remote with me.,590,pettyrevenge

This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work.

Two weekends ago, the coin machine was busier than usual - always at least one or two people waiting to use it.

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

just_a_spoonful,13,,46,1r7pgf,,154,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up. I left it that way and went to the game. I thought nothing else about it.

While I was at the game, I locked my keys in my pickup. So, rather than try to break into my truck or get a ride to my apartment and call maintenance (for an after-hours service fee).

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic. 

TL:DR - bitch made my uni years pretty lonely and tedious, so I ignored the hell out of her when she was assigned seats next me at graduation. ",Make my time at uni miserable? I'll ignore the crap out of you at graduation.,105,pettyrevenge
colespudzo,19,,32,1rbflb,,82,"Some context: for 3rd-5th grade, I went to a public school for ""gifted"" children. That meant that we were all super intelligent, but also massive smartasses. And there were 500 in us and adjacent grades.
***The Story*:** Back in 3rd grade, We had a vice principal that we all really liked. Sadly she had to leave after that year and in 4th grade, we got a new VP. This woman was a classic terrible teacher. you could tell she hated children, not to mention that she was terribly impatient and unforgiving. Due to the smart ass-ness of everybody at my school, she hated almost every single kid there. This meant she was constantly being mean to us, and we hated it.We hated something as much as our 4th grade hearts could possibly hate something. So we rebelled. We formulated, we conspired, and we postulated. our deviously ""gifted"" brains thought of the best possible way to exact our revenge: every moment we were in eyesight of our vice principal, we would point at the ceiling. Thats all. we wouldn't make a big deal of it, we would just casually hold our pointer finger upwards. And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling. She was fuming. she didnt even give us a reason why. but a few of us brave souls persisted over the next few weeks. We paid no mind to her threats and we kept pointing up until eventually she sent like 15 of us to the principals office.

pick_me_apart,6,,15,1r6jed,,83,"I live in a college dorm. About a month ago, my roommate (we lived on the 6th floor of the building) and then-best-friend decided he no longer wanted to talk to me. The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically). Teacher pulls them apart, the jackass gets taken outside and consoled by a teacher, while my friend gets an In School Suspension.

So later, me and my other buddy decided to take advantage if his  uncontrollable rage. In science class, at the end of the period, we would all pass our folders to the end of the room, where me and my friend sat, to be put away. When the guy's folder came to us, I wrote ""Bitch Slapped"" in the interior where he could clearly see it.

Next day, he gets his folder back, his hand shoots up, and he starts raging about how somebody wrote something mean in his folder. Teacher gets all pissed off too and demands to know who did it. Me and my friend can barely contain our laughter.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off. This Jeep now comes barreling down the street as I was halfway over the crosswwalk. They honked the horn at me a bunch of times, banged on the windows and (in the few seconds it took them to drive by) were just general asshats. 

Normally I wouldn't give a fuck but after a long ass day I was tired and my bullshit tolerences were at an all time low. I would have just carried on my merry way home, longingly thinking of the warm shower and hot food that awaited me. 

But no.

They had turned around to come back my way to do it all over again. It being honking and yelling and banging. Again. 
I did the mature thing and ignored them. 
But luck would shine upon me as not 20 minutes later, whose shitty jeep do I come across? 

Yes the gross orange one that those twatwaffles had been in.

With nary a person in sight. I sprang into action and quickly and quietly walked up to the drivers side wheel. Making sure i wasn't seen I reached down and stole the valve cap/air pressure cap for the tire. Then walked around and did the same thing to the rear passengers.

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return.

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.

 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general.

I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*.

She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.

This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

She did not do that at all, instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class.  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.  

It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page (though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly) and she never did end up going to the World Series.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

Redsnork,61,,144,1r3jsq,,640,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away.

Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.


I waited, waited patiently, until the moment was right. The clock ticked on: in 15...10...5 minutes, class would end. It was then that I took my revenge. When she wasn't looking, I ""borrowed"" a pencil from her spare pencil cup.

KiranPanesar,33,,58,1r5e44,,190,"So I'm a Computer Science student at university. There's this one guy in my class who has talked through pretty much every lecture so far, no matter how many times people politely ask him.

So, this afternoon I find myself sitting behind this jackass and, lo and behold, he's chatting away like it's his living room.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

I whip out my iPad and go to his website and sign up for his service, using my legal first name: 

    shut up in class'); DROP TABLE users; --

And surname name:

    and sanitise your damn inputs'); DROP TABLE items; --


(I saw the table names he was using over his shoulder) 

He spent the rest of the lecture (roughly 90 minutes) unsuccessfully trying to figure out why his login script didn't seem to work, and then where all his data went.

The deadline is tonight midnight (~8 hours). I wonder if he'll figure it out and get enough data in his system in time...

Tl;dr: Talk through every one of our lectures and get an SQL injection on your main coursework.

EDIT: Just to address the opinion that this was 'too far'. It's not like he'll get zero for this project. I didn't delete all of his coursework or anything horrible like that. It'll take him a couple of hours to figure it all out at most. Just a bit of sweat for all the disturbance he's caused.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,180,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

I'm 18 and out of school and she's 15 so it makes total sense that I can have multiple ear piercings and go out partying with exchange students while she can't- she's too young! Well, she got annoyed at how happy I was away from home that she blocked me on all social media, not before sending me horrible messages, and has been completely petty to me.

She agrees to Skype then won't, is aggressive to any type of contact I try to make, and is acting like an entitled brat. But she will also visit me in Taiwan in 2 weeks with my father. (She was actually *complaining* about this for a while!)

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant, while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the company's head researcher. Great evening. It's nice to be a grad student.",Insult me on my birthday three months ago? No free food for you.,134,pettyrevenge

On our way home my friend that was driving switched lanes in front of one of those assfucks that try to speed up before you can get into their lane, but she had the faster car and got over.

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us. They proceed to pass is, barely avoiding hitting us, and try to brake check us (horribly, if I may add). Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us. Each time we tried to pass they'd move over a few inches (seriously the lanes are so fucking small) and the driver had to slam on her brakes.

We reached a red light. We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us. We stopped far enough back that they couldn't do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gestures.

I didn't want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote (Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for, but am supposed to share. I recognize this flaw, and I do not care).

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

Said coworker (we'll call her Melanie) was getting a lot of folks with alcohol. As you can imagine, she was calling for a lot of 99s.

Seafood called her register and told her in a not-so-nice way to stop calling her 99s, because they were interfering with the game which was playing over the speakers. Puzzled, Melanie called the service desk to see what she should do. The nice lady at the service desk replied: ""Call them louder, call them longer."" And so she did. Even the people who were able to take 99s were getting in on it with much pleasure, calling for her 99s themselves many times, especially during important announcements on the game.

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling. She was fuming. she didnt even give us a reason why. but a few of us brave souls persisted over the next few weeks.

When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically).

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head.

I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return.

Okay, so I walked into the bathroom to pee really quick between classes. Note that it's a small bathroom, only a couple stalls, 1 sink, and 1 air dryer.

When I walked in, there was a girl drying her hands. Okay, no problem. I go to the bathroom and she's still drying her hands. The. *whole*. time. I get out, and wash my hands. This bitch is STILL drying her hands. After realizing she wants her hands as dry as the Sahara, I shake my hands once as hard as possible, and storm over to the door.

So bitch-co-worker is still on my ass on every little thing, so I started doing something else to annoy her. Our office has sloping walls with allot of windows. Bitch-girl is sitting with her back to two of those windows, so around noon a lot of sun comes through and falls on her computer screen making it hard for her to see. So she has taken possession over those two windows stopping much of the sunlight from coming into the office (and limiting my view of the outside world, of which I long ever so much for). So I’ve started opening the blinds a couple of times a week in the morning, just a little, just waiting for noon to come, so the sun will shine it’s sweet rays straight down on her computer screen, forcing her to stand up, get up on the tip of her toes (did I mention, that she is short) to close the blinds.

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,45,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

jayriley,12,,14,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break.

You know how people don't get personal space and decide to push their cart THISCLOSE when you're in line? The lady behind me was like that. Maybe it was because I was giving the person in front of me enough room. Like a good citizen.

Anyhow, I'm bagging my own groceries and chatting with the cashier. Lady behind me pushes her cart toward me. I give her *the look* but she ignores me.

The cart comes further, and she's actually pushing the damn thing into me. I sigh loudly, in an attempt to point out, umm, I'm standing here. YOU CAN WAIT THIRTY GODDAMNED SECONDS TO PUSH YOUR CART HERE.

Nope. Nothing. She knows what she's doing. She just looks at me in that, ""I know what I'm doing but I also know you won't do anything about it"" look. I don't know what the fuck her problem is.

I scoot the front of the cart behind me for a little more room. She takes this as an invitation to CONTINUE PUSHING HER FUCKING CART INTO ME. At this point, the cart is halfway into the walkway and I'm squeezed between it and the counter. What in the actual fuck.

I still have to pay, but the cart is preventing me from reaching the credit card reader. I grab it and swing it full out into the walkway. I swipe my card and finish the transaction. As I'm walking out, I push the cart even further away from her.

babiesonacid,18,,61,1r53lr,,260,"I'm a teller for a financial institution. We have an automatic coin machine in the front lobby available for members (and non-members) to use.

My schedule includes every Saturday morning, and Saturdays are what I call ""coin days"". I'd say that 85% of transactions I do on Saturdays are cashing in coin tickets. No biggie, it's really easy and I anticipate the break from the 'normal' stuff.

Two weekends ago, the coin machine was busier than usual - always at least one or two people waiting to use it. A member comes in, sees there is someone using the coin machine, and decides to come to my teller window. He has a smug look on his face and a [mega jug](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ln0cac1q331qzwowd.jpg) in his hands. I greet him as I would any other member: ""Hi there, what can I do for ya?"" He slams the mega jug on the counter, which is full of change, smirks, and says in the most despicable tone: ""Have fun"".

I looked at him incredulously. ""Sir, there's a coin machine over there.."" *points*

He scoffs. ""But there's someone using it, and I'm in a hurry this morning. I need this counted out. Can't you just take it to the back and count it there?""

I took a deep breath.. ""No, sir. We do have another branch with a coin machine on (street) that you can take it to, if you'd like.""

""Listen, I don't have time to drive all over town just to get my money. I want you to take my change to the back and count it out for me, and I want my cash in return.""

By this time, the person who was at the coin machine was done and waiting in line to cash in their ticket, and yet another member came in with their change and is now using the machine.

""Sir, I'm sorry, but with that amount of change I would really need you to use the coin machine, and I'd be happy to take your ticket when you're finished."" I should mention that, if this were any other day and a member had presented me with a not-so-ridiculous amount of change, then I'd have no problem counting it out for them.

So, my mom's been bugging me to take her to see Catching Fire (the sequel to the Hunger Games), I'd never even seen the first, but I agreed, watched The Hunger Games, and picked her up and took her to the movies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm such a good boy.).

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

They don't. They get more and more obnoxious every 10 minutes, and I have turned around and told them to be quiet (nicely), someone several chairs DOWN from me yells for them to be quiet, and someone a couple rows BACK asks them to be quiet.

I give it one more ""**Shut. Up.**"", to no avail.

....and then it fucking happens. Problem number 3: I zone out for 10 fucking seconds thinking ""JUST SHUT UP!"", miss some huge announcement in the movie, and I'm **lost**. I have no idea what just happened, or why the music got all sad, or what was just said.

I don't get mad easily, but I'm pretty god damn mad at this point. I briskly jog to the managers desk and I simply say

&gt; ""Look, I missed a huge plot point because of these guys. They shut up briefly, and then resume talking. I'm missing even more of the action right now. You will come tell them to be quiet, and 5 minutes later, they'll resume again. Please, don't make me come back out here. I've already missed the excitement in the beginning of the movie, don't make me miss more.""

Sure enough, he comes in, shuts them up. Sure enough, they start talking again. 2 people beside me stand up and turn around, and before they can even say anything.... the manager is there with his hand up in true ""I've got this"" fashion, and escorts all the little chatter boxes out.

I walked out with a couple people (who were presumably going to concession), so no one knew of my heroic actions, but I will rest well knowing I avenged my fellow movie goers, anonymous or not.

dr_gigglefarts,10,,43,1r1mlk,,225,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",268,pettyrevenge

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect.

Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools. Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

And surname name:

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up. I left it that way and went to the game. I thought nothing else about it.

While I was at the game, I locked my keys in my pickup. So, rather than try to break into my truck or get a ride to my apartment and call maintenance (for an after-hours service fee). I stayed the night with the head coach so I could go exchange film with the next opponent's coach and had my girlfriend bring me my spare truck key when she was coming to visit on Saturday. I spent the day Saturday breaking down film and then went out to eat with my girlfriend. I got back to my apartment at around 7pm. When I got to the door, I could hear ""Man in the Box"" still playing. I had forgotten all about it, so it had played around the clock for about 27 hours.

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

She never said anything about it and even if she had, she had no bearing on my grade in the ""assistant"" class. ",Assistant Principal Gets Unwanted Calls,159,pettyrevenge

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically).

Raiith,12,,13,1r3t0v,,72,"So, this past monday (which happened to be an exhausting 14 and a bit hour day for me between school and work) while walking home I had the pleasure of encountering a car full of assholes. This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off. This Jeep now comes barreling down the street as I was halfway over the crosswwalk. They honked the horn at me a bunch of times, banged on the windows and (in the few seconds it took them to drive by) were just general asshats. 

Normally I wouldn't give a fuck but after a long ass day I was tired and my bullshit tolerences were at an all time low. I would have just carried on my merry way home, longingly thinking of the warm shower and hot food that awaited me. 

But no. 

These fuckers came back. 

They had turned around to come back my way to do it all over again. It being honking and yelling and banging. Again. 
I did the mature thing and ignored them. 
But luck would shine upon me as not 20 minutes later, whose shitty jeep do I come across? 

Yes the gross orange one that those twatwaffles had been in.

With nary a person in sight. I sprang into action and quickly and quietly walked up to the drivers side wheel. Making sure i wasn't seen I reached down and stole the valve cap/air pressure cap for the tire. Then walked around and did the same thing to the rear passengers. 

I then continued on my way, cap in hand until I came to a ditch 5 minutes from my house. I threw them in the darkest crevice I could find.

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

THE REVENGE: When my Mother-in-law looks after the kids, after the kids are asleep for nap time, my MIL will very kindly clean up a little bit and do laundry (very nice of her). However, whenever she puts our (my wife and I) laundry away, she ALWAYS puts it away in a place it doesn't go. At first, I put it down to the fact she doesn't live here, so probably has no idea which drawer we put things.

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did. He stood up and I think he said excuse me, but I had earbuds in and pretended I couldn't hear him.

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,45,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give.

Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*.

She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.

I just called and spoke to one of the workers there who said that the other winners won because they did the extra credit things (filming on Texas State campus and incorporating the apartment's mascot, Miko) which yes was in the rules, but did not say how much extra credit would be awarded.

[Here are the rules they posted.](http://i.imgur.com/4EDwE1S.jpg)

I asked the worker on the phone how much the extra credit was worth then if it was able to full in for almost 1000 more views than the second and third place winners, and he said he did not know. He stated that he had been given the chance to view all the videos and say which one he felt should win, and that was part of how they determined it. He said he would pass along my feelings to some of the higher-ups when they got back from lunch etc.","Posted last week about my apartment doing a video contest for most views, winner getting $400.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times. That what you get for keeping me up last week. I did it for me; I liked it.","""This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch!""",91,pettyrevenge

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

I manage to look and get the make and model right as they dive in to the car. I reach to grab something, anything, to help me with at least getting a better description. Right as he is shutting the door his hat falls from his head and I nab it up before they booked it. Upon return I call my boss, the cops, and my assitant manager to get the story told. Afterwards I check the hat price on ebay for shits.

Redsnork,61,,144,1r3jsq,,640,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

""And you didn't even want a free burger and fries?""

""No way. That food will kill you.""

One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest.  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote, you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself.  It had to be unmuted by the remote control.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,180,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

You better believe we managed to get that chain out on time, all hands on deck and pushing other orders down the cue. You also better believe that I wrapped every individual spool of chain with enough cling film and packing tape to choke a moose. For security reasons, of course.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

just_a_spoonful,13,,46,1r7pgf,,154,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up.

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I didn't want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote (Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for, but am supposed to share. I recognize this flaw, and I do not care).

She was a little absent minded sometimes, so when she was in class one day, I took the remote and stuck it in the microwave. Then I left. Happy Hunting! She eventually found it and told me later how she must have done it when she was getting her lunch together or something.

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

**TL;DR Squirrel got into my Dad's bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch, we saw a squirrel fall off, and laughed, really hard....**

The cashiers who are not old enough to scan alcohol and tobacco products call for 99s (for example: ""99 on four, please!"") Well, today was game day for OSU and we were getting a lot of traffic. Said coworker (we'll call her Melanie) was getting a lot of folks with alcohol. As you can imagine, she was calling for a lot of 99s.

Seafood called her register and told her in a not-so-nice way to stop calling her 99s, because they were interfering with the game which was playing over the speakers. Puzzled, Melanie called the service desk to see what she should do. The nice lady at the service desk replied: ""Call them louder, call them longer."" And so she did. Even the people who were able to take 99s were getting in on it with much pleasure, calling for her 99s themselves many times, especially during important announcements on the game. The customers, once having the situation explained to them, thought it was absolutely hilarious. The fun lasted about 45 minutes. Seafood never called back.

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

This woman was a classic terrible teacher. you could tell she hated children, not to mention that she was terribly impatient and unforgiving.

We formulated, we conspired, and we postulated. our deviously ""gifted"" brains thought of the best possible way to exact our revenge: every moment we were in eyesight of our vice principal, we would point at the ceiling. Thats all. we wouldn't make a big deal of it, we would just casually hold our pointer finger upwards. And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling.

The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically). Teacher pulls them apart, the jackass gets taken outside and consoled by a teacher, while my friend gets an In School Suspension.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off.

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi.

jayriley,12,,14,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

Everything was going swimmingly, as usual the fast lane was 10+ the speed limit and going by the other 3 lanes. I was so happy. Enter commander shitbird. This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

teuker,164,,430,1r5efr,,1063,"Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field. Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

""Firstname (she LOATHED being called anything except Dr. Lastname),

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

Every time I opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got angrier. I went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how she'd treated me and agreed I'd done nothing wrong. 

My biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that, so I swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers. She got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing. Even if I had got caught, the ensuing meltdown was well worth it. 

I started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so I told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work.

She did not do that at all, instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class.  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

Redsnork,61,,144,1r3jsq,,640,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

riotryan,49,,112,1rbgg4,,618,"This happened over 20 years ago, but it's probably my best example of petty revenge. I was 20 years old and worked at a fast food restaurant. It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

dr_gigglefarts,10,,43,1r1mlk,,225,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper. Woops.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",268,pettyrevenge
echofy,13,,48,1reouh,,219,"I'm a college student living in a house with two other girls. We have a simple chore chart that rotates weekly. One of my roommates almost never does her chore, and this week I decided I'd had enough of taking out overflowing trash bags when it was my week to do dishes.

Tomorrow, the chart rotates so she'll be on dishes. I ran the dishwasher yesterday but decided to let the clean stuff sit in there for a while, forcing everyone to instead dump their plates in the sink. Tonight, I emptied the dishwasher but I left all the dirty plates, cups, and utensils in the sink. Now she's going to have to empty the sink and put everything in the dishwasher.

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect. For the last week, it's been normal to expect  2-3 worksheet packets (overall 5-10 pages) and a quiz almost daily. Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools. Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.

So, this afternoon I find myself sitting behind this jackass and, lo and behold, he's chatting away like it's his living room.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

And surname name:

He spent the rest of the lecture (roughly 90 minutes) unsuccessfully trying to figure out why his login script didn't seem to work, and then where all his data went.

The deadline is tonight midnight (~8 hours). I wonder if he'll figure it out and get enough data in his system in time...

Tl;dr: Talk through every one of our lectures and get an SQL injection on your main coursework.

EDIT: Just to address the opinion that this was 'too far'. It's not like he'll get zero for this project. I didn't delete all of his coursework or anything horrible like that. It'll take him a couple of hours to figure it all out at most. Just a bit of sweat for all the disturbance he's caused.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,180,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

So, I like to make playlists for specific situations like working out, long drives at night, rainy days, etc. My favorite type of playlist to make is the breakup comp. I put these playlists on discs and exchange them with friends pretty frequently. A 2 and a half year relationship down the shitter prompted the creation of one such playlist which I then burned to a disc. 

...which I then got her to [autograph.](http://i.imgur.com/T57goMa.jpg) I thought the heart was a little much, but whatever. She was pissed that I even asked.

After that, I framed it along with the [track list.](http://i.imgur.com/86x0Sj4.jpg)

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

She never said anything about it and even if she had, she had no bearing on my grade in the ""assistant"" class. ",Assistant Principal Gets Unwanted Calls,159,pettyrevenge

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant, while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the company's head researcher. Great evening. It's nice to be a grad student.",Insult me on my birthday three months ago? No free food for you.,134,pettyrevenge

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us.

Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us.

We reached a red light. We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us. We stopped far enough back that they couldn't do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gestures.

I didn't want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote (Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for, but am supposed to share. I recognize this flaw, and I do not care).

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

**TL;DR Squirrel got into my Dad's bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch, we saw a squirrel fall off, and laughed, really hard....**

Said coworker (we'll call her Melanie) was getting a lot of folks with alcohol. As you can imagine, she was calling for a lot of 99s.

Seafood called her register and told her in a not-so-nice way to stop calling her 99s, because they were interfering with the game which was playing over the speakers. Puzzled, Melanie called the service desk to see what she should do. The nice lady at the service desk replied: ""Call them louder, call them longer."" And so she did. Even the people who were able to take 99s were getting in on it with much pleasure, calling for her 99s themselves many times, especially during important announcements on the game.

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically).

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.

I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

crazypancakes,9,,18,1r4yhp,,63,"I am fully aware we bring this on ourselves, and the whole incident could be avoided if we are better at doing laundry, but here it is.

BACKSTORY: We have two kids; a two year old, and a seven month old. We both work, and haven't quite figured out how to balance looking after the kids and doing all the housework. We're doing OK, but there's always something that can be done; laundry specifically.

THE REVENGE: When my Mother-in-law looks after the kids, after the kids are asleep for nap time, my MIL will very kindly clean up a little bit and do laundry (very nice of her). However, whenever she puts our (my wife and I) laundry away, she ALWAYS puts it away in a place it doesn't go. At first, I put it down to the fact she doesn't live here, so probably has no idea which drawer we put things. But, I noticed that when she puts away underwear for example, even if I have a full drawer full of clean underwear, so it is pretty obvious that is its home, she will put my underwear with my shirts.

Takalak,3,,9,1r3707,,52,"Sweet, sweet, petty revenge! I'm posting over my phone for the first time, so I hope nothing goes wrong. 

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did. He stood up and I think he said excuse me, but I had earbuds in and pretended I couldn't hear him. I leaned forward in the universal ""I'm getting off at the upcoming stop"" position but I held off on actually getting up until the last minute, making him stand and wait. Ha!

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,45,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

jayriley,12,,14,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room.

I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

I wake up to him cleaning and start to help

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I'd come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station.  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her.   
One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest.  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote, you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself.  It had to be unmuted by the remote control.  Once I figured this out, I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it.",Took the remote with me.,590,pettyrevenge
n33dyourlov3,40,,115,1r13h2,,444,"A few months ago I worked as a cleaning lady in a large day care. This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work. After a month of harassment, embarrassment, and belittling, I decided to walk out early-mid shift leaving good ol Nessa to clean the mess all by herself.","Treat me like a dog, I quit half way through my shift!!",559,pettyrevenge

Two weekends ago, the coin machine was busier than usual - always at least one or two people waiting to use it.

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",268,pettyrevenge

I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet).

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

just_a_spoonful,13,,46,1r7pgf,,154,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

Mr. high beams got stuck behind the bus (with no chance of switching lanes thanks to the traffic) while it had to wait for traffic to clear so the bus could to turn left, while I was able to merge right and get on with my day.",Flash your high beams at me? Get stuck behind the bus!,200,pettyrevenge
LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up. I left it that way and went to the game. I thought nothing else about it.

While I was at the game, I locked my keys in my pickup. So, rather than try to break into my truck or get a ride to my apartment and call maintenance (for an after-hours service fee).

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch.

***The Story*:** Back in 3rd grade, We had a vice principal that we all really liked. Sadly she had to leave after that year and in 4th grade, we got a new VP. This woman was a classic terrible teacher. you could tell she hated children, not to mention that she was terribly impatient and unforgiving. Due to the smart ass-ness of everybody at my school, she hated almost every single kid there. This meant she was constantly being mean to us, and we hated it.We hated something as much as our 4th grade hearts could possibly hate something. So we rebelled. We formulated, we conspired, and we postulated. our deviously ""gifted"" brains thought of the best possible way to exact our revenge: every moment we were in eyesight of our vice principal, we would point at the ceiling. Thats all. we wouldn't make a big deal of it, we would just casually hold our pointer finger upwards. And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling. She was fuming. she didnt even give us a reason why. but a few of us brave souls persisted over the next few weeks. We paid no mind to her threats and we kept pointing up until eventually she sent like 15 of us to the principals office.

pick_me_apart,6,,15,1r6jed,,83,"I live in a college dorm. About a month ago, my roommate (we lived on the 6th floor of the building) and then-best-friend decided he no longer wanted to talk to me. The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically). Teacher pulls them apart, the jackass gets taken outside and consoled by a teacher, while my friend gets an In School Suspension.

So later, me and my other buddy decided to take advantage if his  uncontrollable rage. In science class, at the end of the period, we would all pass our folders to the end of the room, where me and my friend sat, to be put away. When the guy's folder came to us, I wrote ""Bitch Slapped"" in the interior where he could clearly see it.

Next day, he gets his folder back, his hand shoots up, and he starts raging about how somebody wrote something mean in his folder. Teacher gets all pissed off too and demands to know who did it. Me and my friend can barely contain our laughter.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off.

But no.

I did the mature thing and ignored them. 
But luck would shine upon me as not 20 minutes later, whose shitty jeep do I come across? 

Yes the gross orange one that those twatwaffles had been in.

With nary a person in sight. I sprang into action and quickly and quietly walked up to the drivers side wheel. Making sure i wasn't seen I reached down and stole the valve cap/air pressure cap for the tire. Then walked around and did the same thing to the rear passengers.

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did.

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi.

 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general.

I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up.

She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.

RotatingMaleCow,21,,26,1r0xcu,,23,"A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane. Everything was going swimmingly, as usual the fast lane was 10+ the speed limit and going by the other 3 lanes. I was so happy. Enter commander shitbird. This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass. For a whole 25 fucking minutes commander shitbird was my bitch and going 15 mph slower than he was previously.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

Redsnork,61,,144,1r3jsq,,640,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

""And you didn't even want a free burger and fries?""

""No way. That food will kill you.""

As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,180,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

You better believe we managed to get that chain out on time, all hands on deck and pushing other orders down the cue. You also better believe that I wrapped every individual spool of chain with enough cling film and packing tape to choke a moose. For security reasons, of course.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

just_a_spoonful,13,,46,1r7pgf,,154,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

Mr. high beams got stuck behind the bus (with no chance of switching lanes thanks to the traffic) while it had to wait for traffic to clear so the bus could to turn left, while I was able to merge right and get on with my day.",Flash your high beams at me? Get stuck behind the bus!,200,pettyrevenge
LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up.

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant, while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the company's head researcher. Great evening. It's nice to be a grad student.",Insult me on my birthday three months ago? No free food for you.,134,pettyrevenge

On our way home my friend that was driving switched lanes in front of one of those assfucks that try to speed up before you can get into their lane, but she had the faster car and got over.

Now these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things. We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes. The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us. They proceed to pass is, barely avoiding hitting us, and try to brake check us (horribly, if I may add). Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us. Each time we tried to pass they'd move over a few inches (seriously the lanes are so fucking small) and the driver had to slam on her brakes.

We reached a red light. We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us. We stopped far enough back that they couldn't do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gestures.

Whenever I would come home, the roomie would have been watching tv, and the remote was always on her side of the room instead of placed back on the microwave stand in neutral territory when she was done. I didn't want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote (Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for, but am supposed to share. I recognize this flaw, and I do not care).

She was a little absent minded sometimes, so when she was in class one day, I took the remote and stuck it in the microwave. Then I left. Happy Hunting!

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

**TL;DR Squirrel got into my Dad's bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch, we saw a squirrel fall off, and laughed, really hard....**

The cashiers who are not old enough to scan alcohol and tobacco products call for 99s (for example: ""99 on four, please!"") Well, today was game day for OSU and we were getting a lot of traffic. Said coworker (we'll call her Melanie) was getting a lot of folks with alcohol. As you can imagine, she was calling for a lot of 99s.

Seafood called her register and told her in a not-so-nice way to stop calling her 99s, because they were interfering with the game which was playing over the speakers. Puzzled, Melanie called the service desk to see what she should do. The nice lady at the service desk replied: ""Call them louder, call them longer."" And so she did. Even the people who were able to take 99s were getting in on it with much pleasure, calling for her 99s themselves many times, especially during important announcements on the game. The customers, once having the situation explained to them, thought it was absolutely hilarious. The fun lasted about 45 minutes. Seafood never called back.

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

This woman was a classic terrible teacher. you could tell she hated children, not to mention that she was terribly impatient and unforgiving.

Thats all. we wouldn't make a big deal of it, we would just casually hold our pointer finger upwards. And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling.

The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically). Teacher pulls them apart, the jackass gets taken outside and consoled by a teacher, while my friend gets an In School Suspension.

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,45,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

-AreYouAWizard-,6,,11,1r1c3w,,41,"  So the thing is that in my house, my mom makes us scrub the bottom of our shoes every night so that we don't track dirt all over our apartment. Among me and my brother, we share this chore and alternate on who does it every night.
  On to the story.
  Like most people, I really love to sleep. This particular night I had a lot of homework, and was just exhausted from five hours of homework and projects. I go to sleep and about fifteen minutes in my brother wakes me up by violently kicking my bed (we share a bunk bed, me being on the top bunk) from below. Why? I have no fucking clue, he's just being a little shit. This would not go unpunished.
  As I mentioned earlier we have to share the chore of scrubbing our shoes and I say to my dear brother: ""Hey, I'll do the shoes tonight."" Of course he lets me do it. Now is where my evil plan takes place.

jayriley,12,,14,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

RotatingMaleCow,21,,26,1r0xcu,,23,"A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane. Everything was going swimmingly, as usual the fast lane was 10+ the speed limit and going by the other 3 lanes. I was so happy. Enter commander shitbird. This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times.

My boyfriend said she's staying with us in the bed tonight because she's lonely. Fuck that. She usually sleeps downstairs with his brother's dog. She's just being a brat.

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting. At any rate, within a year, I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made money--doing course management for the IT team of my university. But I still harbored a grudge at being maligned

One of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate. It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty. Once I learned the system, I saw my path of revenge--I cross-listed this professor's courses (which never were cross-listed in the first place) with a test course, meaning that every time she tried to upload, she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help. So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respond:

""Firstname (she LOATHED being called anything except Dr. Lastname),

It's rather odd that you had this error, but I have been able to fix this problem for you. You may go ahead and upload your syllabus.

She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break.

A member comes in, sees there is someone using the coin machine, and decides to come to my teller window. He has a smug look on his face and a [mega jug](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ln0cac1q331qzwowd.jpg) in his hands. I greet him as I would any other member: ""Hi there, what can I do for ya?"" He slams the mega jug on the counter, which is full of change, smirks, and says in the most despicable tone: ""Have fun"".

I looked at him incredulously. ""Sir, there's a coin machine over there.."" *points*

He scoffs. ""But there's someone using it, and I'm in a hurry this morning. I need this counted out. Can't you just take it to the back and count it there?""

I took a deep breath.. ""No, sir. We do have another branch with a coin machine on (street) that you can take it to, if you'd like.""

""Listen, I don't have time to drive all over town just to get my money. I want you to take my change to the back and count it out for me, and I want my cash in return.""

By this time, the person who was at the coin machine was done and waiting in line to cash in their ticket, and yet another member came in with their change and is now using the machine.

""Sir, I'm sorry, but with that amount of change I would really need you to use the coin machine, and I'd be happy to take your ticket when you're finished."" I should mention that, if this were any other day and a member had presented me with a not-so-ridiculous amount of change, then I'd have no problem counting it out for them. Not today, and definitely NOT for this guy.

He huffed, and before he walked off to get in line, I mustered up the most pleasant tone I could and said: ""If you need any assistance with it, just let me know! Have fun!""","""Have fun.""",321,pettyrevenge

So, my mom's been bugging me to take her to see Catching Fire (the sequel to the Hunger Games), I'd never even seen the first, but I agreed, watched The Hunger Games, and picked her up and took her to the movies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm such a good boy.).

Anyways, we get stuck in the first row. The first. I told her we could come back, and she said ""No please! I want to see it!"". Alright, whatever, I can deal with that.

You probably already know what problem number 2 is. Yep, the ""we're going to talk the whole movie"" crowd are directly behind us. Whatever, fine, as long as they keep it down to a low roar, I'm happy.

They don't. They get more and more obnoxious every 10 minutes, and I have turned around and told them to be quiet (nicely), someone several chairs DOWN from me yells for them to be quiet, and someone a couple rows BACK asks them to be quiet.

I give it one more ""**Shut. Up.**"", to no avail.

....and then it fucking happens. Problem number 3: I zone out for 10 fucking seconds thinking ""JUST SHUT UP!"", miss some huge announcement in the movie, and I'm **lost**. I have no idea what just happened, or why the music got all sad, or what was just said.

I don't get mad easily, but I'm pretty god damn mad at this point. I briskly jog to the managers desk and I simply say

&gt; ""Look, I missed a huge plot point because of these guys. They shut up briefly, and then resume talking. I'm missing even more of the action right now. You will come tell them to be quiet, and 5 minutes later, they'll resume again. Please, don't make me come back out here. I've already missed the excitement in the beginning of the movie, don't make me miss more.""

Sure enough, he comes in, shuts them up. Sure enough, they start talking again. 2 people beside me stand up and turn around, and before they can even say anything.... the manager is there with his hand up in true ""I've got this"" fashion, and escorts all the little chatter boxes out.

I walked out with a couple people (who were presumably going to concession), so no one knew of my heroic actions, but I will rest well knowing I avenged my fellow movie goers, anonymous or not. That applause when you little assholes got escorted out was for me, and I know it, and my momma knows it!

dr_gigglefarts,10,,43,1r1mlk,,225,"Long time fan of pettyrevenge, thought I would share.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

Bad move lady.

So I pack up, smile, apologize again and wait outside to let her do her business. As I'm standing there, I hear her drop a loud f-bomb.  BINGO! I WIN BITCH! She continues swearing and flushes and I quickly put on my headphones. By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper. Woops.

As she walked out I gave her the biggest smile I could muster and told her to have a great day. Her face, priceless. Enjoy your soggy behind lady and think twice before yelling at the cleaning crew.","Fine, no tp for you",268,pettyrevenge

I'm pretty sure she's trying to pad our grades, but when she gives us so much to do that we can't finish it all it has the opposite effect. For the last week, it's been normal to expect  2-3 worksheet packets (overall 5-10 pages) and a quiz almost daily. Yesterday we had two quizzes, a six page packet, and two other 30-question worksheets. 


She switched our seats for the third time in a month today, and once we'd all sat down she handed out another quiz, packet, and individual worksheet. Then she started talking about how people in her calculus class were getting A's on her tests, so she needed to make them harder. That's a principle employed by SOME colleges/law schools. Not a phenomenon I'd expect to see in a high school. At this point, everyone in the class was sick of her shit, but no one had the balls to do anything about it. It was time for me to strike.

So, this afternoon I find myself sitting behind this jackass and, lo and behold, he's chatting away like it's his living room.

Looking over his shoulder, I see he's working on his large coursework task for this module (50% of the grade) – an online shopping website where users can sign up, add items to their basket and checkout. I also notice that the version he's working on it **live** online (i.e., accessible from any computer on the Internet). 

Seeing as he doesn't really pay attention in class and his site looks insanely bad, he probably isn't all too hot on his security. I figure now is the perfect time to get revenge.

And surname name:

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

**P.S.** To those who wonder if other innocent users got infected.
I prepared for this. I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer. Complained that it ran slowly to library staff. Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc.

We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes.

While I was at the game, I locked my keys in my pickup. So, rather than try to break into my truck or get a ride to my apartment and call maintenance (for an after-hours service fee). I stayed the night with the head coach so I could go exchange film with the next opponent's coach and had my girlfriend bring me my spare truck key when she was coming to visit on Saturday. I spent the day Saturday breaking down film and then went out to eat with my girlfriend. I got back to my apartment at around 7pm. When I got to the door, I could hear ""Man in the Box"" still playing. I had forgotten all about it, so it had played around the clock for about 27 hours.

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

She never said anything about it and even if she had, she had no bearing on my grade in the ""assistant"" class. ",Assistant Principal Gets Unwanted Calls,159,pettyrevenge

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

I had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant, while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the company's head researcher. Great evening. It's nice to be a grad student.",Insult me on my birthday three months ago? No free food for you.,134,pettyrevenge

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch.

jagadiosa,3,,30,1r18dk,,60,"I work for a very large company as an IT Field agent and was tasked with installing a new system for my company which had an office inside of an EXTREMELY large Tech company that makes (hint) Processors.  The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

BACKSTORY: We have two kids; a two year old, and a seven month old. We both work, and haven't quite figured out how to balance looking after the kids and doing all the housework. We're doing OK, but there's always something that can be done; laundry specifically.

THE REVENGE: When my Mother-in-law looks after the kids, after the kids are asleep for nap time, my MIL will very kindly clean up a little bit and do laundry (very nice of her). However, whenever she puts our (my wife and I) laundry away, she ALWAYS puts it away in a place it doesn't go. At first, I put it down to the fact she doesn't live here, so probably has no idea which drawer we put things.

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head. 

Why the fuck didn't they move next to each other to talk? I was the 4th or 5th person to board the streetcar so they had time, from when passengers exited to passengers entering, to change seats. No , the wanted to shout at each other across the isle and over my head. Obnoxious arseholes.

The revenge: I shifted to the edge of me seat, forcing the men to lean forward and try to talk around me. I pulled out my large 700mL water bottle and drank it slowly, blocking their eye contact. I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return. 

The final bit of karma was when three man child sitting next to me had to get off the same stop I did. He stood up and I think he said excuse me, but I had earbuds in and pretended I couldn't hear him. I leaned forward in the universal ""I'm getting off at the upcoming stop"" position but I held off on actually getting up until the last minute, making him stand and wait. Ha!

The_Forbidden_Toot,14,,14,1r0gs1,,45,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi.

When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give.

When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small). She turns around and sees my almost nude body in all of it's glory-that's not the best part though. The way I was positioned, I'm pretty sure she saw my balls. She looked really surprised and a bit flustered. She got dressed quickly and left in a rush. I didn't plan that last part, it just worked out that way.

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha!

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times. That what you get for keeping me up last week. I did it for me; I liked it.","""This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch!""",91,pettyrevenge

daniellelasvegas,119,,396,1r28l6,,1340,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review.

YesYouCannot,204,,217,1r7zub,,735,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

riotryan,49,,112,1rbgg4,,618,"This happened over 20 years ago, but it's probably my best example of petty revenge. I was 20 years old and worked at a fast food restaurant. It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

""And you didn't even want a free burger and fries?""

""No way. That food will kill you.""

He screamed at me to take my food to the break room. I was never told to eat in the dining room again.

Needless to say, I lasted only a couple more weeks after that.

She grows vegetables hydroponically, harvests and packs them and on Mondays she fills her van with crates of vegetables and delivers them to local restaurants and lunchbars.  She runs a good part-time business and makes a tidy part-time profit.

So last Monday, she's at a busy intersection in town.  The lights are green, so off she goes, but the vehicles at the other side of the lights aren't moving.  She's trapped in her van in the middle of the intersection as the lights change again and she's blocking traffic.

It's completely her own fault.  She screwed up.  She should have checked ahead and made sure the way was clear.  She knows this.  How embarrassing.  She has to sit there cringing in the middle of the intersection waiting for the way to be clear so she can move.

I'd come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station.  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her.   
One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest.  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote, you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself.  It had to be unmuted by the remote control.  Once I figured this out, I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it.",Took the remote with me.,590,pettyrevenge

While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog.

During the summer I work at a state park in my home town as an assistant park ranger and some days I had to work the morning shift which starts at 7am. The first thing I'm supposed to do, bright and early, is clean up the bathhouses/restrooms. There are two entrances, one on either side, men and women. Since I only have an hour till the park opens and I'm a guy, it makes sense to clean the women's side first and get it done with, that way I can clean the men's side with no rush. 

Anyways, I unlock the door and put my yellow plastic chain up with a sign attached essentially saying that the bathrooms are closed, we're cleaning, we'll be done shortly. As I'm wrapping up cleaning the toilets, the sinks, the showers, picking up trash and going about the rest my duties, hehe, I hear a lady call into the bathroom, (the park I work at is a beach and has numerous entrances that only the locals really use and know about, so it wasn't uncommon to run into a few early morning joggers or whoever) I stick my head out and notice a hefty older women in her 50s-60s about to take down my top notch security system. Holding up my hand and pointing to the sign I politely apologize and say that the park hasn't yet opened and that I'm still cleaning but would be done in a few moments. I instantly notices the expression on her face turn sour and she starts yelling at me, explaining that her entry fees (really?) are my source of income blah blah blah and that because she is a local she shouldn't be turned away. She then starts complaining that I'm not doing my job fast enough and then demands to be let in.

By interrupting me and pretty much forcing me to stop what I was doing so she could plant her fat ass on a toilet that I had just god damned cleaned.. she unknowingly kept me from restocking the toilet paper.

LovesEwoks,72,,69,1ri9iq,,387,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient.

murrhurr,24,,53,1rbsaq,,184,"Back in 2007, RuneScape was one of the largest free-play MMOs. It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit. 

RS was blocked at school, so kids often went to the library to play in their free time. I was one of those kids. I couldn't really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus. Lol...

So I'd see this kid at the library also playing RS. He was pretty high-leveled at the time (80ish), and had light-blue rune armor--the best in the free game. I would choose the computer next to him and log-on to my character. I'd talk to him and he seemed friendly enough. He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up. As a noob (I was level 35 at the time), I gladly took on this offer. 

However, as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams. I would attend the library regularly, and after about a week of gaining my trust, the guy offered to trim my adamant armor. Of course, since he was so helpful to me before, how could I refuse!

In RuneScape, like other MMOs, players trade items through a specific screen. So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor, which was expensive for a noob like me. A friend loaned me some money to buy it, which was about 30,000 coins or 30k. Even though it cost so much, I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to him.

We completed the trade, and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor. He said depending on your crafting level, it can take a few minutes, because you had to trim each part by itself. He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom. I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return. Meanwhile, his avatar on the screen beside me stood still. Then it auto-logged (meaning the game automatically logged-out his account after a period of inactivity). 

Now it had been over 10 minutes since he left. I wondered what took him so long. After waiting a bit longer, I went to check up on him. Checked the male bathrooms on both floors. He wasn't there. It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit. 

Well, *I* wasn't going to have that. Lucky for me, there was a particular computer this kid always used, probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something. I hatched a plan. 

You see, in a game as popular as RuneScape was, there were ""private servers"", many of questionable quality. These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications, like 50X normal XP rate and player commands that, in the real game, only admins (JMods) could use. 

One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game. You could tell it was a scam, because many of the accounts advertising it were high-level--meaning that other curious players checked out the site, and got their main accounts hijacked with malware. No pro player would actually advertise a private server--they were already far ahead in the real game. I was gonna infect this kid with malware.

My plan was simple. I went on the kid's computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape. Then I typed in the URL of the private server website. I did as much fishy shit as I could--clicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way. At this point, I figured the computer was fucked, but functional. On the outside, everything seemed normal. Until it was too late. 

I wanted to test if the computer was infected now. I logged onto the disposable account and logged off. I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password. I hopped back to the uninfected computer, and logged onto my main account. It was in Varrock, a popular trading city for players and spammers. Now to play the waiting game. I added the disposable account name to my friends list, so I could be notified when it logged in. Sure enough, five minutes later, my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL. Satisfied, I logged off and went home. 

When the kid came back the next day, I confronted him. I asked him why he left without trimming my armor. Guy said, ""Oh dude, I forgot. I'm real busy."" Of course you're not busy, you're in middle school. Guy was pulling lies from his ass. I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor, actually. He didn't seem to care. Fair enough.

I took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer. That's all I needed to see. I said I had to leave, guy still didn't seem to care--too busy killing other players in the wilderness.

I wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight. I went home and disobeyed my parent's rules to not play RuneScape. To my delight, I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL. My plan was a success. The neat thing is that these bots could spam 24/7 until they were muted and/or banned--that was a bonus. I only needed to ensure he couldn't access his account. 

I returned to the library the next day. Guy was furious. I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldn't logon to his account--password was changed. He didn't have recovery questions, so his account was pretty much fucked. I don't know what happened after that, but I hope his main was banned for botting. 

**TL;DR:** I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items. No regrets. =)

Blackmaille,26,,57,1r4zlw,,180,"I work for a wholesaler, measuring and cutting chain, packing orders, securing payments, the whole bit. We're in the middle of our busy season right now, and a number of our larger customers will place bulk orders; orders that are rather huge, but take about 2 months to arrive at my warehouse. 

I got one of these orders in yesterday, and one of my bulk customers has ordered over 200 meters of chain. I send them an email notifying them that the shipment is in as soon as I get in the office in the morning. We don't cut chain until payment is secured and the customer notified.

This customer calls me at 3pm, and tells me they need their order AT THEIR DOOR for Friday. I look at my clock, and tell them that isn't possible as I only have an hour to measure out 200 meters of chain before my mail pick up. They respond:

""What, can't you just stay late and get my order out on time?""

I was literally floored for a moment. This customer is always a pleasure to work with, and I will literally bend over backwards for them. Now they're accusing me of being lazy?

You better believe we managed to get that chain out on time, all hands on deck and pushing other orders down the cue. You also better believe that I wrapped every individual spool of chain with enough cling film and packing tape to choke a moose. For security reasons, of course.

I hope they enjoy the extra 10 min they're going to be spending opening each spool of chain.

Redsnork,9,,36,1r3gpz,,166,"A few years ago, I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop. I never abused my power, except for this one time:

A good friend of mine came up to me one day at school, raging mad. Her brother, who was autistic, had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade. They would call him names, make fun of his strange interests, and talk about him behind his back.

Later that week, at our weekly Boy Scout meeting, I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had. They had made a list of quotes said by my friend's brother. I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friend's brother were in my troop, and more importantly, under my power.

I had an agenda for the meeting, something about celebrity eagle scouts, but I immediately ditched it as I formed my plan.

I called the meeting to order, and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas. I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards, and that anyone that didn't pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip. (This entailed digging holes for people to shit in, and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we left.)

I pretended to be nice by ""allowing"" people to form their own cleaning groups. Naturally, the boys that harassed my friend clumped together.

As soon as everyone was split up into groups, I divyed up areas where each group had to clean. I gave the bullys the bathroom. Now, this wasn't a nice, modern bathroom. The lights were dim, the tiles were coming up, and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small, cramped room. The group of about four boys came to me and complained. I tried to ignore them, but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster. I told them that if they tried to report me, I would tell him what they had been writing on the board. After that, they didn't say anything.

Everyone else got their jobs done in about half an hour, but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meeting.

Before I closed the meeting, I pulled the bullys aside. I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again, I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran out.

The boys looked scared, and not a single one of them said anything in response.

The next day, I told my friend what I had done. On the verge of tears, she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brother.

Later on, I ended up meeting him, and invited him to a boy scout meeting. I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop, and let him make the first s'more during the program that night. I'll never forget the smile on his face, or the scowls of the bullys, as he made his first s'more.

Eventually, word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done. He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it. I admitted to everything. He ended up being a friend of the boy's mom, and was familiar with what their family had to go through. He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL, but told me to ""keep on looking out for those who need it.""",Make fun of my autistic friend? Clean the toilets!,202,pettyrevenge

just_a_spoonful,13,,46,1r7pgf,,154,"I was driving to work this morning on a 4 lane road (2 lanes going north, 2 lanes going south). I was in the left lane and a school bus was stopped in the right lane making a stop to let kids on. Where I live, if a school bus is stopped with its blinking lights to pick up kids, EVERYONE has to stop, regardless of the direction that the bus is going in. So, being in the left lane, I stopped. The car behind me didn't like that I was stopped and flashed its high beams at me.

Just as the bus was ready to start moving again, it put on its turn signal to get into the left lane (in front of me) so I stopped to let it merge. Again, car behind me doesn't like that I'm still stopped so he flashed his high beams yet again.

I'm pretty used to knowing the morning bus routs because I leave at the same time every morning and I know that the bus that I just let get in front of me makes a quick left turn into a neighborhood right after it merges into the left lane.

So, just as the bus merges in front of me, I quickly switched over to the right lane before a huge line of traffic was going to pass.

LochnessLurky,14,,54,1r0cz0,,152,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

dankenascend,20,,24,1rahn2,,154,"When I was 23, I was coaching at a school in Huntsville, AL and living in a 1 bedroom apartment in a sketchy part of town. My downstairs neighbors were always loud. There was either a party or a fight almost every day. On a particular Thursday night, I was kept up all night by loud rap and fighting. Stomping around didn't seem to deter the behavior, so I went to work on almost no sleep. Between the end of the school day and the game, I went back to my apartment to eat and pick up my clothes. In an attempt to get them back, I detached the speakers from my stereo and laid them face down on the floor. I put in Alice in Chains and put the CD on loop with the volume way up. I left it that way and went to the game. I thought nothing else about it.

jaimystery,7,,31,1r9f1y,,138,"This happened a couple of months ago but I thought of it again today because I added to my petty revenge plot

I don't go to the movies very often for . . . reasons.  The last time I ventured into theaters, it was a somewhat popular movie, the place was packed and I ended up sitting on the top row (which I hate but oh well).

2 minutes before the previews start, 4 women come in and end up sitting in my row - I moved down for them (argh  I hate not sitting on the aisle) which was my first mistake because the witches proceeded to talk during the previews.  Which, okay.  It's just the previews so I sigh and just ignore them.

Then the movie starts and the woman next to me puts her handbag on her lap and props her cell phone inside and proceeds to check her phone while the movie is playing. 

It's super distracting since the light and hand movements are in the corner of my eye and about 20 minutes in, I ask her - in a whisper - if she could please turn off the phone.  She does but a few minutes later, she starts commenting to me about the film like we're friends.

DOUBLE DAMN ARGH - I want to watch the movie. I don't want to freaking discuss it while I'm watching it and does this woman have any couth at all?  She finally stops when I stopped responding but I've missed some key points in the movie.

My revenge has been petty and long lasting.  During one of her forays into checking her phone, she typed a quick email and included her phone #.  Since that day and at least once a week, as I run across websites with a ""contact us"" page that includes a phone number, I fill it in with her phone number and a fake funny (at least to me) name.

Today some construction company will need to call Fanny Bullswatter. Last week it was Sucre M Diche.   I have her phone # jotted down near our reception area so  when I get telemarketing calls,  tell them they need to contact Melana Hoarster at Rude Movie Lady's Phone number.   Maybe RML will keep her phone turned off in the future so she doesn't have to deal with all the calls.

k-squid,13,,17,1ra14h,,135,"I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater, and thought I'd post one of my own!

My boyfriend and I used to live in a college town. While there, my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater. In reality, it was just really old, and they were only able to get second run movies. As a result, there were barely ever many customers. On a weeknight, the average amount of customers would be around 30-40 for two sets of three movies. My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owner's son [We'll just call him OS] screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touched.

Anyway, we were watching the end of Movie A, which was running a bit late. OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B (it was running after Movie A) to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it. Surprisingly, people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in. That night, a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly, making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats. Already sick of them, I turned around and said, ""Excuse me, we're still watching this movie. You're only supposed to come in here if you're going to be quiet."" They quieted down, and I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong.
Any time something funny happened in Movie A, a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding. The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent, even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle. I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that, and one of them spit back, ""You need to learn to respect your elders! We're only laughing at how dumb this movie really is!"" To which I replied, ""It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourself.""

The movie was over soon after that, so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater. OS was going home, leaving my boyfriend to start his shift. I started plotting my revenge immediately. Movie B was more of a serious movie, and that only helped my plan along. After my boyfriend started up Movie B, I went up into the projection booth. As luck would have it, the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater, so I didn't have to worry about ruining the show for anyone else.

For those of you unfamiliar with projection booths, they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies. This way, the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such. At the shitty theater, the windows were basically plexi-glass that you could easily remove. I took out one of the pieces and waited. Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie, I'd poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion. From up there, my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater. The lights were off in the booth, so these assholes couldn't even see me. I saw one get up a couple of times, but I remained in the booth, faking laughing at least every 15 minutes or so. 

When the movie was over, and they left, my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear. He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere, but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldn't show him exactly where I was. He said they didn't seem to recognize him in the light, so they didn't even connect him with me.

BNugget,7,,29,1r8juf,,130,"When I was in middle school, there was a particular assistant principal who was known for being a pain. Even the teachers were afraid of her.
 
She rubbed me the wrong way on 2 separate occasions. First, there was a group of about 5 guys who shared a table at lunch. 2 of the idiots got into a fight, so she came to our class to tell us all that those 5 guys were getting assigned seats at different tables. I stood up to her and said only the responsible people should be punished, not the remaining 3 people who weren't involved. Her response: ""They can defend themselves. I don't need to hear from their spokespeople."" Way to be fair, old bag.

Second, I worked in the office answering phones and my first weeks there I made the mistake of buzzing her office to let her know someone was on the phone to speak to her. She told me, condescendingly, never to buzz her always her secretary. She's a middle school assistant principal (of which we had 3), not exactly a CEO who is really busy and can get away with acting entitled. Her secretary was actually a really nice lady and really busy, I didn't want to bother her for something so petty (all she would do is relay the call to the AP anyway!). She was the secretary for the whole department, not exactly Ms. AP's personal assistant.

My revenge: anytime someone called for that particular AP (usually angry parents), I transferred the call directly to her. I did not buzz her with the standard courtesy ""Mr. Smith is calling for you should I take a message?"" and I did not forward it to her secretary unless I knew the principal was actually busy. So every time I had a phone call for her, and I knew she was just sitting in her office, it would ring at her desk and she would have no choice but to answer or have a voicemail waiting. Even if she didn't answer, I bet it interrupted her train of thought and made her stew.

marvin,11,,24,1r3fov,,110,"Okay, so here I'm truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum: A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago. Not even gonna bother with a throwaway.

So I'm a Masters student, responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers. These events are usually somewhat lavish, where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take 30-60 of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner, drink lots of beer and socialize. What can I say, the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment. I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentations.

So, for a bit of backstory: I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago. Good food, plenty of free beer, good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved. Anyway, it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute (she's not even a programmer, let's call her Claire) had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest company's expense. Whatever. No one cares, if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this, they've just saved the $30,000 they would have spent on a headhunter. So anyway, as the night draws to a close, me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling. (This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning). At this point, ""Claire"" notices me and says derisively ""so, do you always spend your birthdays picking up other people's trash?"" while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up. I back away, make this small finger-waving gesture and say ""nuh-uh, no trash pickup service for you, young lady!"". (How did she even know it was my birthday?) I make another mental note that this girl is no good, pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I know.

So anyway, back to this November afternoon. Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students. I've carefully monitored the guest list this time, seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target. But we still have two open spots, an hour before the presentation starts. I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying ""hey, can Claire join us for the presentation since there's still room for more?"" I carefully weigh my options. This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for. But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway. This is when I remember the incident three months ago. I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back: ""Sorry man, I need to cover my ass on this one. She's not a programmer."" and get the reply ""Sure thing"".

Cawkii,29,,22,1rdk0e,,93,"After watching a video on YouTube, it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too. TL;DR at the bottom for anyone that doesn't want the build up.

My Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree. We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study window.

After a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn, and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders, probably thinking he wants some too. 10 minutes go by and I look out again, to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung. My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using. The wire isn't very thin, about as thick as a pencil. I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after 5 minutes of betting, we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hose.

The next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders, I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now. But oh no. My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel, as long as it doesn't, well kill them, the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons, and I don't blame him...

I go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up, thinking that he's going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away, oh no he wasn't. I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up, with a nice evil smile.

2 days go by without any sightings of a squirrel, until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize, another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in, but lathered up with the same engine grease he used...

5 minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire, one foot, two hands, then as he leaves the safety of the branch, THUMP!, he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash, me and my Dad are in tears and laughing, and we have a toast to engine grease!
(The height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only 10 foot or less, I am sure he got away ok, although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on. In that case he put chicken wire all around the ball.)

**TL;DR Squirrel got into my Dad's bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch, we saw a squirrel fall off, and laughed, really hard....**

toxicockatoo,11,,36,1rbthg,,90,"A coworker of mine is about 15 years old and cashiers. The cashiers who are not old enough to scan alcohol and tobacco products call for 99s (for example: ""99 on four, please!"") Well, today was game day for OSU and we were getting a lot of traffic. Said coworker (we'll call her Melanie) was getting a lot of folks with alcohol. As you can imagine, she was calling for a lot of 99s.

Seafood called her register and told her in a not-so-nice way to stop calling her 99s, because they were interfering with the game which was playing over the speakers. Puzzled, Melanie called the service desk to see what she should do. The nice lady at the service desk replied: ""Call them louder, call them longer."" And so she did. Even the people who were able to take 99s were getting in on it with much pleasure, calling for her 99s themselves many times, especially during important announcements on the game. The customers, once having the situation explained to them, thought it was absolutely hilarious. The fun lasted about 45 minutes. Seafood never called back.

bassboyjoe,16,,21,1r3dao,,84,"So there is this girl (lets call her Jenna) that was on my course at university. For whatever reason, after the first year in the summer she decided she didn't like me, and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this, all in quite unsavoury terms. A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me (being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women) had absolutely no idea, and thus didn't respond to her advances. 

For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group, which was a big deal to me. I didn't get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary. As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls. 

Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldn't find out until it was too late or when I didn't have the money. So most evenings I would come home from uni, cook dinner and it eat it in my room, on my own. 

She blocked me on facebook (which in itself I couldn't give a crap about) but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials, which meant I couldn't see anything she posted or events she created. 

I tried my best to ignore it, and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up, however I still never felt like I belonged there, which is a horrible feeling when you're a couple of hundred miles from home.

Anyway after our final exams we all hit the pub. I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing. Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years. This must have seemed a good idea to her, but it was just an insult to injury for me. 

Graduation day comes round (today) and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses. I find my seat in the cathedral, one seat into a row. Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me? Yep, you guess it, Jenna. She is on the end of the row. 

I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me, or mention how nervous she was. There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet. Multiple times she tried to converse with me, and multiple times I ignored that bitch. At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt. 

Might not have been much, but it made me feel fantastic.

This woman was a classic terrible teacher. you could tell she hated children, not to mention that she was terribly impatient and unforgiving. Due to the smart ass-ness of everybody at my school, she hated almost every single kid there. This meant she was constantly being mean to us, and we hated it.We hated something as much as our 4th grade hearts could possibly hate something. So we rebelled. We formulated, we conspired, and we postulated. our deviously ""gifted"" brains thought of the best possible way to exact our revenge: every moment we were in eyesight of our vice principal, we would point at the ceiling. Thats all. we wouldn't make a big deal of it, we would just casually hold our pointer finger upwards. And of course, our soul-sucking VP hated it. she got up in front of the entire school just to say that we were now forbidden for pointing at the ceiling. She was fuming. she didnt even give us a reason why. but a few of us brave souls persisted over the next few weeks.

The reason is a long story in itself; basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirting/cheating. When I found out he was judging me for this (he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends), I asked him why he hadn't talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend. He said that he didn't like the choices I was making (???) and thought I wasn't a good person. Anyway I couldn't handle living with him after that, knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person, so I requested a room change. Now I live on the second floor of the building. 

Today when I was coming back from class, I saw him waiting for the elevator. I took the stairs up to the second floor (toward my room) and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor. So, either the elevator got to him later than it should have, or on his way up, the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator, and he had to wait probably 10-15 seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room.

In middle school, there was this girl I knew. She was really smart (Knew Korean and got straight A's in a school where it took a kid fifteen minutes to find Russia on a map) and really pretty, but she was also cripplingly shy and would spend all free time in a hallway or somewhere just sitting there.

There was also this guy who was kind of a weird dick. He used to do shit like tell my friend she had nice...parts, and snitch on everyone for everything, even if whatever rule they were breaking affected no one in any way. He also had serious anger issues, if you told him anything slightly insulting, even if you were clearly just messing with him, he would flip out.

Anyway, this one day we were in music class, and shy girl sits down in the guy's assigned chair. He is is not amused. He tells her to get out of his chair, and when she doesn't do so in time, angrily pulls the chair out from under her, dumping her onto the floor.

My buddy had kind of a crush on the girl, and he sits behind the guy, so he reaches up and slaps him in the face. He starts crying and tries to punch my friend (rather pathetically). Teacher pulls them apart, the jackass gets taken outside and consoled by a teacher, while my friend gets an In School Suspension.

So later, me and my other buddy decided to take advantage if his  uncontrollable rage. In science class, at the end of the period, we would all pass our folders to the end of the room, where me and my friend sat, to be put away. When the guy's folder came to us, I wrote ""Bitch Slapped"" in the interior where he could clearly see it.

Next day, he gets his folder back, his hand shoots up, and he starts raging about how somebody wrote something mean in his folder. Teacher gets all pissed off too and demands to know who did it. Me and my friend can barely contain our laughter.

This car was a gross color of orange and a Jeep. Full to the brim with what seemed like half drunk teenagers. 

While walking home after aformentioned long ass day, as one can imagine I was tired and really wanted to kick my steel toes off. This Jeep now comes barreling down the street as I was halfway over the crosswwalk. They honked the horn at me a bunch of times, banged on the windows and (in the few seconds it took them to drive by) were just general asshats. 

Normally I wouldn't give a fuck but after a long ass day I was tired and my bullshit tolerences were at an all time low. I would have just carried on my merry way home, longingly thinking of the warm shower and hot food that awaited me.

I did the mature thing and ignored them. 
But luck would shine upon me as not 20 minutes later, whose shitty jeep do I come across? 

Yes the gross orange one that those twatwaffles had been in.

With nary a person in sight. I sprang into action and quickly and quietly walked up to the drivers side wheel. Making sure i wasn't seen I reached down and stole the valve cap/air pressure cap for the tire. Then walked around and did the same thing to the rear passengers.

The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.

Setting: A streetcar (think electric bus/train), single seat on left, double seats on right if you faced the front

Situation: I got on the streetcar and these two grown adult men in their 40s or older, were sitting across the isle from each other. 

One was sitting in the single seat on the left, the other was in the window seat on the right, leaving the inner isle seat free. I took that seat.

These two imbeciles proceeded to continue to have a loud conversation with each other over my head.

I pulled out my phone and moved it around every time they tried to make eye contact. Basically, I was being obnoxious in return.

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi.

jayriley,12,,14,1r1cso,,32,"It was Saturday night. Late, like around 3ish. I was winding down and relaxing, watching tv. My roommate and his lady friend for the night came in. When his lady friend for the night came in she didn't acknowledge my presence, much less say hi to me. How are you not going to say hi to me when you come into MY room? Rude, but I'll let it slide, don't really care. Then they started talking loudly, got into bed loudly, and watching tv loudly. They did this even though it was obvious I was watching something on tv, and I probably wouldn't be able to hear what I was watching on tv over their loudness. I decided to let it go and just go to sleep. But I couldn't because the tv was so loud.  After they got in bed together, they started having some stupid conversation. It was obvious that the lady wanted to have sex with my roommate, from the way she was talking to him. It honestly was pitiful. Fortunately they fell asleep before that. 


 I decided to get back at them for ruining my tv time, as well as being loud and rude in general. My school is in a relatively cold area(It's literally 23 degrees F as I'm typing this) and our heater/AC doesn't fully work for some reason, only blows cold air. I saw that they hadn't fallen asleep totally underneath the covers. I turned the air to the maximum cold setting, as low as it would go. ""Hopefully they'll get a cold before the night is over"", I thought to myself. I slept completely under my covers so I would stay warm. I thought that would be it for my petty revenge. 


I stirred around noon-ish and woke up. Since I had been curled up in a ball under the covers all night I decided to stretch out, so I took almost all my covers off and laid down flat on my bed, face up. I sleep nude, so I left a small bit of a bed sheet to barely cover up my shlong. *Barely*. A few minutes later my roommate's lady friend for the night gets out of bed and walks a few paces, so she's basically at the foot of my bed(our room is very small).

AnoruleA,19,,23,1r6kqx,,32,"**Background**

Behind my house there is a short, narrow alley, and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live.  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days (one night) and she needed a place to park.  Since road construction was preventing my friend (and everyone else in my neighborhood) from parking in the street, I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spaces.

**Conflict**

When me and my friend were watching a movie in my room, I heard people talking outside my window.  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friend's car, so I popped outside to explain the situation.  Immediately they were on the offensive, and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was, in fact, not our place to park.  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces, even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work, school, and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied.  NEVER in the half-year I've lived here.  *Whatever*, I thought, *there's no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anyways*.

It was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car ""Tenant parking only"" with permanent marker.  Yeah, I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray, but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper?  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property, and he said he was the one who wrote the message.  This was a grown man, probably in his sixties, who did it.  We exchanged some insults and I left.

This is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge.  I can handle irrational people - I expect as much from strangers anyways.  But ever since then (this happened a month ago) the people who live there have started double-parking, which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there.  YEAH, YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES, HUH?  THAT'S WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK?  Fucking assholes.  I do have my own car, but I park it in my driveway; during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friend's car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways.  But, apparently they didn't take it.  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situation.

**The Revenge**

Since I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day, I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces.  This usually amounts to two a day.  So far, no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see.  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them, and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer.",How dare you write on my friend's car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

RotatingMaleCow,21,,26,1r0xcu,,23,"A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane. Everything was going swimmingly, as usual the fast lane was 10+ the speed limit and going by the other 3 lanes. I was so happy. Enter commander shitbird. This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, 15 miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass. For a whole 25 fucking minutes commander shitbird was my bitch and going 15 mph slower than he was previously. I was so happy in that moment I could have vigorously masturbated but I did't want to miss a minute of his misery.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSeR5wrQUU8) was my submission, which granted did not do what they had hoped it would be obviously... But still managed to get way more views than everyone else. I just called and spoke to one of the workers there who said that the other winners won because they did the extra credit things (filming on Texas State campus and incorporating the apartment's mascot, Miko) which yes was in the rules, but did not say how much extra credit would be awarded.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

Acct4NonHiveOpinions,27,,70,1r5ydj,,21,"I live in the party dorm in my school, but I'm up on the third floor, so most of the noise doesn't make it this far up. Maybe they get so drunk they can't climb the stairs; I don't know, but everything's usually confined to the first floor. On top of that dorm party night is typically Wednesdays, so the really crazy stuff only happens once a week. My room is diagonal from a larger room with four people in it. It was converted from a little study room last year, so I'm kinda disappointed about not having that anymore, but hey, I don't hold it against the residents. The school just needs the extra dorm space.

What I do hold against them is the noise. I don't mind that they party too, the more power to them, but we do have a few hall rules, which include no noise that can be heard in the hall after 12:30, and a no partying on Thursday night rule, just so there's a least one guaranteed night of peace. Now I guess I'm a bit of a square because I like to go to bed at around 10 and get up at 6, so I'm often trying to sleep while the noise is in full swing, but I respect that they're within the bounds of the rules and all. I've practically gotten used to it; I'm a heavy sleeper, so once I fall asleep their noise doesn't bother me anymore, and I'm regular enough that my internal clock has adapted the system. I do, however, always look forward to Thursday nights; they're a peaceful reprieve and I take advantage of the quiet to read a little and make sure I get to sleep right at 10.

Last Thursday, however, the RA of the floor was out in the hospital with food poisoning, so the diagonal four person room decided that it'd be a great idea to have one of their loudest nights yet, complete with loud bass-pounding music, screaming, stomping on the floor, sacrificing virgins, the works. It was window-shaking godforsaken loud enough from my room, so I pity the people adjacent to their room, and especially right beneath them. They kept at it well into the night, and I didn't get to sleep until around 3 or so in the morning. From what my roommate tells me, they kept going much later than that.

I've been stewing over this for a week now and finally got my opportunity to enact revenge twenty minutes ago. I've been working on an essay and just hanging out with my door open when I hear the Breaking Bad intro down the hall. Sure enough, it's coming from the four person room. After listening for a while, it's clear they've only recently started the series. I grab a pen and paper, sneak over to their door, write ""*Walt lets Hank die*,"" and I slide it under. I knock, then quickly slink back into my room and close the door. As soon as I get it shut I hear a ""God DAMN it!"" followed by more shouting and the door slamming a few times. That what you get for keeping me up last week. I did it for me; I liked it.","""This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch!""",91,pettyrevenge
