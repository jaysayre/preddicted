Techsupportvictim,241,678,1r5j3f,1696,Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution The scene My retail that also does tech support for our stuff store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know he had set up man vows never to lie to wife again My job is done ,Never lie to your wife,2374,TalesFromTechsupport,6064,1,top_week

FredFltStn,175,406,1r22gy,1200,A few years ago I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop The app was actually written is basic if that tells you anything As you can imagine support was a bitchWe had a user that was having a strange issue with printing Every time he tried to print something from my application  copies came out of the printer This only happened when printing from my app When printing from Microsoft office everything was fine and dandy  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolutionThe guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC The PC had been recently refreshed so when the desktop support team couldnt figure out the issue they passed the ticket back to hardware and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time No luck on a fix and the ticket was passed back to Desktop supportActually the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times but had been unable to resolve the issue and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks It finally made it to my queue leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wakeI visited the user onsite and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on As the ticket said he could print fine from all of the other apps but printing a single page from my app resulted in  copies He must have had  sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copiesMy app actually printed through the LPT port I checked the setup and everything seemed fine The app was designed to send directly to the printer and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app so I knew that couldnt be the problem I checked the printer and it seemed normal I was seriously stumped and had tried just about everything I could think of Out of options I started playing with the printer again and going through the various menus It had been a long time since Id messed with one of the older LaserJets After about  minutes I blundered across the issue In one of the menus his printer had been manually set for  copies The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting so they would always print the selected number of copies My app just sent the basic info to the printer so the printer used the build in print menu when printingWe had easily spent more than  man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing not to mention a case of paper Modern tech at its finest Thanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Thousands of dollars and dozens on man hours trying to fix a printing issue,1606,TalesFromTechsupport,22463,822,top_week

Rhywden,119,113,1r99ob,629,This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a mediumsized students dormitory  connected clientsPhysical layout consisted of  houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches thus providing  Mbit connections So one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door Internet is downFirst thing to check Local issue Tried connecting to the router remotely  no dice Not only is the Internet down but the whole network Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than Ill ever learnHowever he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error Uplink  fine No errors in the logs Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active onesWe tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything TCPdump didnt show any incoming traffic on our network facing cardUntil by pure chance or maybe desperation we rebooted the switches Because the network suddenly came to life again and ground to a halt mere seconds laterOkay time for another reset this time with TCPdump to watch whats happening And thats when we saw it A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros yes even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port and just one single xF somewhere And it flooded the network for the short time it workedWe then worked out what had obviously happened Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they appeared to still be working I kid you not if you didnt watch them closely youd notice nothing  it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didnt change over time as it usually would in a live networkThe solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again That way we discovered the culprit  who wasnt home at the time of course He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download had bluescreened which obviously didnt agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could,The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport,197,1,top_week

curriedavenger,49,121,1rbq0v,549,Follow up story to thishttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsrbhnotsofineprintAs I said before I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customersNow like most service departments the technicians dont work weekends but the retail department is open  days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up  no real issue it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekendsIt was a busy Sunday which was unusual for this particular store and staff were handling customers  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store  no big deal its where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section so the staff think nothing of it  Nothing until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock roomTurns out one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friends laptop and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store before their friend had class on Monday  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for within reason it didnt matter to management when the work was doneHe starts pulling on the door which is locked by keycard access  He then starts knockingThe technician a lovely lady in her midtwenties was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement  Having seen this guy she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the doors windowThe man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperationIs she fucking ignoring meThe customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out  I thank him and move over to stop this guys impatience from escalating  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help withYou guys need to sort this out  Im here to pick up my wifes laptop and your staff are all ignoring me  That one out back is on the fucking phone  Im parked in a loading zone and I cant waitI apologise and say I will get things moving  I look up the guys job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next from about ten days ago  We only heard back from her on Wednesday four days ago to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered installed and the system testedI know that but obviously Im here now and Im not leaving without itNow I have two options  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard which arrived on Saturday with the other parts or I could tell this guy that technicians dont work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service twice the regular hourly charge for the entirety of the job with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash if she agrees to do itThis is bullshit  I can see her back there  Right now I am looking at her right now he said as he pointed at her  She was on the fucking phone  You should prioritise your customers in the store for fucks sale  What kind of outfit is thisAt this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today and I explain why that was not going to happen Technicians do not work on weekends His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked The girl in the back was not working today and I could fasttrack the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon at no extra charge if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machineThis took the better part of fifteen minutes  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit  He leaves the store in a huff  Two minutes later he returnsI need to use your phone  My cars been towed  And you WILL be paying for itYeah we didnt pay for it,Giant toddler makes noise,670,TalesFromTechsupport,0,0,top_week

curriedavenger,34,53,1rbh79,317,I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store  We specialised in Apple products and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customersOne day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working as she cant check her email  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard requiring the computer to be formally booked into our onsite service system to arrange for parts and service  I informed her of our labour prices explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed withinHaving agreed to that I begin getting her details to be entered into our system  She gives me her phone number but when I ask for an addressYou dont need that actuallyNow how she expects to know what I need I didnt understand and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront  particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed so we cant really take prior payment since we dont know what the extent of the repairs will beI dont want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyersI explain that our service centres database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there  I also explain that without a billing address our checkin software will not process the repairShe reluctantly agrees and I print out the form for her to sign  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand despite having a pen in front of her anyway and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request  the ones pertaining to contact details  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to this particular service job and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entityI ask her what she is doing  I dont want to be harassed by telemarketersI ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with not that I can negotiate different terms but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her under this very contract is to speak with her in respect to this repair job and show her the wording that says just that  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of termsJust get it doneShe slides the service agreement towards me grabs her handbag and walks out  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it given that I have not yet signed off on it  The computer is in limbo and I cant do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed  However I do have her phone number  I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned  As it was not currently working it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up unless she requests that we hold onto it  Naturally she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us  I inform her that there is a storage fee of  per day until the service request is completedShe starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that its grabbing the attention of our other customers even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all dayA few hours later she storms into the store with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson  a  year old girl  about how we are extorting her  I step in and apologise for making her come back and get the new agreement printed out  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement asis or leave with her computerShe then goes quiet and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hitand starts sobbing  Sobbing and reading the terms she had earlier deleted  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something especially as she cried over the contract and continued to sob as she signed it  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a wordHer husband was an asshole too but thats a story for later,Not so fine print,370,TalesFromTechsupport,0,0,top_week
curriedavenger,14,46,1rbmxm,303,Sometimes you gotta feel bad for a guyThis was a slow day in the computer shop so its just me and the manager Mick in our small branch on university campus  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive  I say its possible but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and its likely to be expensiveAn hour later a guy that is the picture of middlemanagement rocks into our store out of breath and sweaty presenting a password protectedencrypted USB keyThis is itMick and share a glance at each otherIm the guy that called you earlier shouts the customer  You know about the data on the drive he pleadsMick takes a look at the drive and notes its a secure drive that encrypts the data on itWhat happened I askTurns out that the customers boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties  Because the customer was a contractor he was liable to lose his job over thisMick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering it would appear as gibberish since it was encryptedThe customers nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you takes the drive and leavesA couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer  a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me  He mentions the drive and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractors sister  This contractors laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmins friends very unhappy and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect  which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most peopleSysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive having been told it contained information pertaining to the universitys staff and payroll ie highly sensitive data for a protosystem to undergo testing with  While the actual project was real the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss Sysadmins friend Greg  Of course this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractors work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met  Greg couldnt actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractors inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himselfGreg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing  A simple task but importantIn spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone and data redundancy was an obvious step  At least until the rest of the storyThe contractor having forgotten the password destroying the supposedly only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced  When Greg found the drive a few days later plugged into the contractors computer FFS the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data  Understandably his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonestyAt this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughterI mean for fucks sake the password was the guys full name and extension number,Some things are worth remembering,349,TalesFromTechsupport,0,0,top_week

in giving everybody even the dumb ones service with a smile and our customers were generally quite happyIm a brand new hire only been there a day or so  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers and a shiny new neverbeforeused phone extension has been assigned to me  Its also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or anotherSo my phone rings the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasnt from a queue this caller punched my extension directly  The caller is a middleaged sounding womanMe This is EDC first name how can I help youCaller  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot first and last name at company  she knows my name and extensionMe  Yes it is  What can I do

Navy and hes on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library remember she has a Mac and Im almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire meMe face firmly planted on desk    uhhh  thats not really my department  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computerCaller  Well my son used to fix my computer but now hes in the Navy so he cant fix my computer for me facepalm but Ive been reading my Windows

impressed with my IM ignoring customers  bad but seemed to understand my explanation  We both felt bad for the woman but theres not much we could do to help we couldnt afford to sit on the phone for hoursThe woman called back two weeks later seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone her first cell phone ever  The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a severalminutelong voicemail  I forwarded it to

slowly on their system and they needed it to be quickerJava is not a fast language Its great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them The powers that be bosses decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer VP who happened to start work on this very dayVP claimed to have  years of experience developing C He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prizeSo on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door EWD we just got a ticket from VP Apparently he cant access the development serverHuh I set him up and tested his account on Friday Forward it and Ill take a lookA few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and Im a little surprised It reads something to the amount ofi dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do hereIm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see whats amiss After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems I email him explain that Im the admin and ask if he can give me more information about the problem I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go A few minutes later I get the next emailhaha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss BB and have HIM fix this shitNow Im starting to get a little annoyed I email him back that Ill be over soon and deliberately waste  minutes looking at pictures of cats Feeling calmer I set off to figure out whats wrong only to find him about  feet away standing at the door to the server room Our server room like any server room should be is locked and airconditioned It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users Only the Head Techie HT the bosses and I have keys to this room anyone else must access it remotely Some use terminal editors directly into the server some pushpull with git all are welcome to use ftp but none are allowed in the roomI walk over to VP to explain this but as soon as he realizes who I am he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voiceIve been standing outside this door for  fucking minutes I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck inThe guy is practically shouting in my face Im shocked but quickly recover VP we dont go in there except for maintenance You can access it remotely using vim or git but no oneI DONT GIVE A SHIT IVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASSBy this point people have come out of their offices to see whats going on BB appears on scene and tells me to take  and let him sort it out I hear him calming VP as I walk offAt this point Im pissed It takes a lot to piss me off but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth After about a minute My Boss MB walks in and closes the door He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless so I just throw it out there years my ass How could someone develop for  years and not know how to edit code remotely What are they even doing over at otherCompanyI dont know I also dont know what BB is going to do about it That fella sure has a temperWe talk for a few minutes and theres a knock at the door BB VP and HT walk in VP has the most loathesome smirk Ive ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier BB looks as happy and clueless as everBB Ooooookay then Now that were all fine and dandy lets talk There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but theyre really easy fixes and heres what were going to do Were going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server VP also wants more monitors so were also gonna put a video card in it too EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because its his workstation And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind usBB is beaming MB and HT both look numb and I probably do too VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand Nothing personal buddyBB Great If anyone needs me Ill be in my officeBB and VP head out leaving HT MB and I doing our best someoneshotmydog faces We discuss it agree its ridiculous and they eventually leave to go carry it out I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new jobtldr we gave a new employee the wrong workstation and he was understandably upset,The day I realized I was going to quit my last job Warning Language,268,TalesFromTechsupport,164,1,top_week

theunusualsuspect,15,21,1r9cpz,177,So this was maybe a year ago but I just havent sat down to right about itI used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits They also resold T circuits and things of that nature On top of that they also provided pointtopoint wireless access VOIP webhosting and emailProviding support for resold internet really isnt as bad as you think  especially considering I was T and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center Simple stuff And VOIP never really caused any issuesWhat did cause issues was email We actually hosted our own email server I couldnt tell you what we used off the top of my head right now but it was linux based all of our software was And thats fine  it was free and simple Only it wasnt updated regularly or everSo eventually we arrive to the day in question As you may have guessed we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted Well we started receiving a series of interesting emails After a quick google search it turns out its a very basic SQL injection used to essentially retrieve the password for an email account Thing is if you grab the right one say our network administrators email password well thats when the trouble can start especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins Or so I thought  its actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using Ill get into that in a minuteSo me and my coworker inform our network admin He takes a look and bans the IP abusing the form That was it Fantastic We have no idea whats been accessed I inform everyone I can and they assure me our network admin will take care of it And that is that as they sayWell not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam Our internal email accounts and our customer email accounts It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs Im talking verizon yahoo charter  it was just unbelievable So as our network admin is looking for a solution me and my coworker investigate on our ownNow i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right Well guess what Email is hosted via that server as well Which isnt that big of a deal What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHINGSo how it works if youre unfamiliar is as followSSH into our server we allowed the access And from there all you had to do was keep ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts Oh and you didnt need a password to get into them YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT One other thing  sudo commands freely fucking available And theres our god damned problemSo now were a god damned ISP that when I check was responsible for  of the entire spam coming across the internet Thats a shit loadOf course this was immediately brought up to our network admin and the owner I dont know how to emphasize absolute and total despair but they DIDNT FUCKING BELIEVE US You know what they blamed it on Spoofing FUCKING SPOOFING Sorry it still infuriates meThey tried implementing solutions but nothing really panned out  which you know is because someone had unfettered access to our shit It was a constant fight until the day I quit My coworker quit the same day It was interestingI have a whole mess of other stories that Ill eventually get around to but this was just the one that stands out to me,SQL injection Ill just block the IP,198,TalesFromTechsupport,41,1,top_week

RoninSpartan,17,30,1r251v,119,So have I got a tale for you One that has just happened fairly recently A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accusedA little background first though I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a workstudy picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had The offer to take on this position was made because of the server crashing of course the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures and them having  other IT personnel  of whom were under utilized but one ridiculously overpowered network adminThroughout this year after my hire I was able to implement a backup scheme with twotiers attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website learn about Server  to prepare the network to shift from a NovellGroupwise environment to a Windows NetworkingExchange environment and do most if not all of the grunt work of a workstudyThe storyNow because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services However there was one I had acquired administrative access to in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys Shortstuff leaving for another department within the college He had been dealing with the network admin for about  years and just got totally sick of it This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms events and such This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule sometimes it would get too busy to check or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didnt want to see it last minuteSo I read the manual about two months ago shortly after obtaining admin access and found out how to create IT work order notifications tested with one of the other users that book events for the college Success Now we and by we I mean I didnt have to manual check for work orders we were alerted at least  days in advance It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out although no one had mentioned it until last weekI had tried to figure out what could have happened I know I hadnt deleted anything and only added in that notification rule for IT I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldnt find where they might have been since I didnt see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules It puzzled me so I asked Shortstuff what could be going on he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset Ha well I didnt have access so I asked the network admin to look into it He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped I started to think what the hell could have happenedThe IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule or if I might have done something to that system I told him No I didnt delete anything I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert Come to find out yesterday the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime The IT director later that morning had walked into my office because of a FilePrint Server Cluster I was tasked to create I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else I was pissed I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything I looked at my IT director and was shocked So even though I didnt do anything I get my admin access taken away He just replied with Oh and stepped outIt was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry Shortstuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well he said to check the text he had just sent I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well In the huff and puff state the network admin was in without any notice or proper authorization took both my access and Shortstuffs administrative access from that systemWe decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didnt lose their administrative access This was directed toward us that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone elseMe and Shortstuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway when comes along Ladyblonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal She asked about what had happened and we let her know Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization and she uttered I think I might have done that She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought by removing those notification rules she was only removing herself from them I had an intense moment of joy and confidence for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all This was the last straw for Shortstuff and he is going to use it on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years to take down the network admin Later that evening just before I left to head home I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster He then mentioned about us not being at fault but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help Ladyblonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake without us telling her to We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his not just this one but many assumptions and wrongful accusationsWill keep you all informed of the result  Update I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such She has just recently started working here a few months back Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong he gave her a call She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending He stated about me He doesnt know what he is doing He went in the system and screwed something upGODOFIT  network adminUpdate  So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with He replied with This has happened in the past to Shortstuff before and I had talked with GODOFIT about it previously It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACEShortstuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GODOFIT will be on the Presidents desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw Shortstuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend  Shortstuff put up with GODOFITs shit for  years I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience We are supposed to have that meeting shortly this will definitely be a point that is brought uptldr strip my admin access and wrongfully accuse me youre going down mofo Edit they hired me cause they needed another IT guy to

deshe,24,41,1ri4te,172,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I

that guy Listen all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming oh my god I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all

Cloudedguardian,38,21,1rcp13,95,Hi TFTS Ive been a lurker for over a year now and Im certainly no IT girl but I think this still counts and that youll all get a kick out of this I am known by my local friends as The Smart One and as such when one of my local friends had a tech issue Im often asked if I could sort it out for them Its often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button if not just turning it on and off againWell one day the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand Lets call her Red Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook as I had a rather nice laptop that Id gotten for graduation that I had to quote Done some cool crap with Well shes my friend and I like learning about computers so I figured I could give it a shotRed pulls out her Notebook turns it on and logs on before clicking Firefox to load up her internet My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up Im doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this and start asking the obvious questions To me anywayMe Well have you cleared out your cache recently It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your systemRed My whatNow I knew that there was a possibility I wasnt using the correct terms as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me Dad always called what I was thinking of The Cache and so I didnt know what else to call itMe Errr its like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web Some sites are especially bad for it and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them Cheezburger for instance Theres a program you run to clean it out let me see if you have onHere Reds Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off Oh no theres a button on that fox browser thing that does thatI blinked trying to figure out what she was talking about Then I realized that she was talking about the Data management window that you can bring up I resisted facepalming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused Me Errr no I think thats the browser cache Im talking about a different one on the computer itself sorry I might not be using the proper termsGranny Well I dont think clearing the computer is necessary the browser fixes that stuff Reds probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all upAt this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace As I struggle to get anything to load Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down As I searched for an anticirus a cleaner anything I said it was a possibility before giving up and asking her what antivirus she had She said she didnt know what I meantMe Like uh Norton or McAfee Red Oh No I aint got that WhyMe Well I think you might have a virus Theyre really easy for your computer to pick up if you dont have a proper antivirus Its probably whats gumming up your systemRed Ohhh What are you doingI was at that very second looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton I explained as such and Red told me bluntly not to I looked at her with a look of uttermostMe WutRed I downloaded somethin like that a little while ago and it just made things worse So dontI figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones and tried to explain that I think I lost her in the second sentence so I gave up and just said that it wasnt a Proper antivirus but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people She still wouldnt let me download it As she took her Notebook back with me conceding defeat I suggested that if she didnt want to download the free one she could always go to Staples and buy Norton I added that it was what I had and would clean repair and kill all the virus and it was very simple to use It was megaonsale at the moment and wouldnt be a bad idea She told me shed think about it but it was a lot of moneyAbout a week later my sister Black and I seen Red with a brand new laptop I asked her what happened with her Notebook and she said that since it was so slow shed just gone and bought a new one I blinked Me So it wasnt a virus Cleaning it didnt help Well that suRed Oh no I didnt clean it or nuthin I just chucked it and bought a new one insteadMe Wut Black Please tell me you didnt throw that Notebook in the trashRed Nah its too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash My friend actually wanted it if you can believe it So I let her have itMe Ddid you at least get Norton for your new computer Like does your new laptop have some sort of an antivirusRed Nah it doesnt need that junk Its all fast and new Im not gonna have any problems with this baby at allBlack You are going to become this stores best buckin friend aintcha AhouTLDR  Friend buys new laptop for over  rather than spending  on an antivirus,More Dollars than

IsilZha,29,19,1rghh8,97,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

TechGuy,35,8,1r518r,82,I have a small IT business in Austin One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N wireless router I had been to her house once before and met Bella her Great Dane she was friendly and pretty relaxedClient tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in She assures me that the dog is fine and to go inI open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps I didnt want to invade her territory without announcing myself first She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle it is yapping at me At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the factI set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat as the home owner suggested As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth This dog is huge and would fuck me up easilyI do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesnt pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing She get closer and I try to go around her She moves to block me so I back up and she gets closer We are just standing there her growling as I think Im about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but when I stop petting she starts growling Im sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on She doesnt really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave The client just moved into the house so she doesnt know anyone but says she is min away and headed my way She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her Yeah right This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with herIm petting Bella who now has her muzzle in my crotch as I scratch her ears If I screw with the pooch my balls are done Now Im like fuck it and call  and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave So Im just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next min petting her every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT mandog petterFinally an officer shows up Im just hoping that he doesnt walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bellas attention and finally make it outI go and talk to the officer to explain what happened he was really nice about it all and Im glad he saved my ass and Bella didnt meet her demise that day I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs He says Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog I really wasnt thinking about that at all when I said it I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit I owe him one for sureThe home owner shows up and the officer leaves Im speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is yo and normally they live to maybe  or  years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down that this is why she behaved that way She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave I really didnt feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for SaturdayI have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they dont bother me at all but Bella was old dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy My new policy is to never enter anyones home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jawsNever againHome owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside I didnt want her to know that I blamed her for the incident she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon She told me that she is having the

Gambatte,30,6,1rg6w8,72,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the

someone who has never spent time here in our trenches someone who would be totally lost the officer spat on the packed dirt floor  youre escorting a user Godspeed sonI work grunt level support for the uni I attend Mostly my duties include answering phones fixing peoples moble wireless settings and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support  However during the summers some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers New purchases are imaged added to a domain and have special software deployed based on where its going Old relics leaving service  are KillDisced scavenged for parts and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling Its not a bad gigIn order to maintain some degree of CYA when computers arrive to be outprocessed and recycled we keep them for  days before wiping them This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine it can still be recovered Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience Too bad that Most of the time is not  All of the timeThis particular incident began with me arriving caffeine in thermos book in hand for another day of processing I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen noting the paperwork According to the paperwork I can wipe it  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights  I used to sing Daisy Daisy while i worked but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath I laughed and said  no im just grunt support I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed Professor Derpingtons computer yet I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me Then as if it were fate I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on lo and behold its Derpingtons Not boss I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press goWell the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so dont kill it yetOk should I get his files off for himNo he says he needs them ASAP Hes coming here to get themI double take Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map  The idea of a Bambieyed professor navigating our wire strewn technological reliquary of a faculty is novel if not terrifying Soon the professor arrives luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before I walk him through several rooms each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files I step away for while I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime based on the volume of the fans Sir are you done I move to turn the monitor back on I can shut it down and walk you to the exitNO WAIT he reaches out to stop meI reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight The windows file transfer dialog with its loading bar animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive Hold onGB of files are being movedfrom a folder labeled NOT PORNMy discovery happens in an instant and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again that is private Students should not be rooting through professors filesyes sir my mistake I begin walking out  Give me a call when your finished I round the corner and keep walking I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away I double over and laugh for a while eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington Lord of Not Pornia So what happens now he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data He demands that he wants to witness the wiping for security reasons I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was GB of Not porn wasFor Science But he stood by for  minutes as killdisc did its magic I escorted him out and he thanked me and

Kataclysm,28,2,1r2eke,45,I work in IT Ive been involved professionally for going on seven years now and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on  I cant tell you how many times Ive explained to people the importance of having a secure password changing it regularly updating ALL account passwords when youre compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed and stressing the importance of not using a universal passwordI dun fed upFlash back to about  months ago My personal Walmartcom account was accessed without my knowledge and around  worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics The timing was pretty awful for this because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills with accompanying late fees as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund After the two weeks of hell ordering new debit cards because at the time I wasnt sure exactly HOW I was compromised I decided it better to be safe than sorry and generally being completely broke with  kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasnt a heck of a lot of fun I ended up getting the charges reversed This mistake cost me around  I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time I used a unified password system  password to rule them all My old password was a mere six characters long alpha only They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random but still not complex enough I trusted Walmartcom to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease so I didnt have to spend that  seconds remembering my information and typing it inLooking back I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer because I never shop on Walmartcom But hey lesson learned passwords changed computers nuked and reloaded from orbit Its the only way to be sure problem resolved During this time of extreme paranoia while I suspected everything and anything I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different much more complex passwords  digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum I was feeling pretty secure I felt nobody was going to get the best of me againExcept I forgot one account A rather important one tooMy PaypalFast Forward to this last Monday morning Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls complaints and general incompetence I check my personal email on my personal laptop and see a few emails from PaypalKenneth Harrison accepted your payment Timestamp at  AM Im pretty sure I was asleep during this time Or at least trying to sleep Son of a  Followed by another email from PaypalImportant We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal accountWell good for you nice to see you didnt put a stop to it Thanks loads all you did was limit my account didnt ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through Thats just brilliantSo I look at the first email and turns out this individual so kindly transferred  to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors because they did a great job of screwing me overI dutifully log into Paypal and immediately update my password from my old insecure one which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account Shame on me I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction Still waiting hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kindSo now again all my funds are tied up for at least another  days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays This is completely my own fault preventable and I hope this is received as I meant it a cautionary tale for other IT workers The rules are not just for others they are for us as well and when we are caught not following proper procedures not only is it extremely embarrassing it can make us look bad to our clients should they discover our hypocrisy,When changing account passwords dont forget to change ALL of them,47,TalesFromTechsupport,16563,12076,top_week

Techsupportvictim,241,674,1r5j3f,1700,Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution The scene My retail that also does tech support for our stuff store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know he had set up man vows never to lie to wife again My job is done ,Never lie to your wife,2374,TalesFromTechsupport,6064,1,top_week

FredFltStn,175,408,1r22gy,1193,A few years ago I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop The app was actually written is basic if that tells you anything As you can imagine support was a bitchWe had a user that was having a strange issue with printing Every time he tried to print something from my application  copies came out of the printer This only happened when printing from my app When printing from Microsoft office everything was fine and dandy  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolutionThe guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC The PC had been recently refreshed so when the desktop support team couldnt figure out the issue they passed the ticket back to hardware and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time No luck on a fix and the ticket was passed back to Desktop supportActually the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times but had been unable to resolve the issue and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks It finally made it to my queue leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wakeI visited the user onsite and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on As the ticket said he could print fine from all of the other apps but printing a single page from my app resulted in  copies He must have had  sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copiesMy app actually printed through the LPT port I checked the setup and everything seemed fine The app was designed to send directly to the printer and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app so I knew that couldnt be the problem I checked the printer and it seemed normal I was seriously stumped and had tried just about everything I could think of Out of options I started playing with the printer again and going through the various menus It had been a long time since Id messed with one of the older LaserJets After about  minutes I blundered across the issue In one of the menus his printer had been manually set for  copies The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting so they would always print the selected number of copies My app just sent the basic info to the printer so the printer used the build in print menu when printingWe had easily spent more than  man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing not to mention a case of paper Modern tech at its finest Thanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Thousands of dollars and dozens on man hours trying to fix a printing issue,1601,TalesFromTechsupport,22463,822,top_week

curriedavenger,34,50,1rbh79,322,I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store  We specialised in Apple products and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customersOne day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working as she cant check her email  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard requiring the computer to be formally booked into our onsite service system to arrange for parts and service  I informed her of our labour prices explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed withinHaving agreed to that I begin getting her details to be entered into our system  She gives me her phone number but when I ask for an addressYou dont need that actuallyNow how she expects to know what I need I didnt understand and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront  particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed so we cant really take prior payment since we dont know what the extent of the repairs will beI dont want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyersI explain that our service centres database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there  I also explain that without a billing address our checkin software will not process the repairShe reluctantly agrees and I print out the form for her to sign  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand despite having a pen in front of her anyway and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request  the ones pertaining to contact details  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to this particular service job and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entityI ask her what she is doing  I dont want to be harassed by telemarketersI ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with not that I can negotiate different terms but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her under this very contract is to speak with her in respect to this repair job and show her the wording that says just that  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of termsJust get it doneShe slides the service agreement towards me grabs her handbag and walks out  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it given that I have not yet signed off on it  The computer is in limbo and I cant do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed  However I do have her phone number  I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned  As it was not currently working it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up unless she requests that we hold onto it  Naturally she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us  I inform her that there is a storage fee of  per day until the service request is completedShe starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that its grabbing the attention of our other customers even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all dayA few hours later she storms into the store with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson  a  year old girl  about how we are extorting her  I step in and apologise for making her come back and get the new agreement printed out  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement asis or leave with her computerShe then goes quiet and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hitand starts sobbing  Sobbing and reading the terms she had earlier deleted  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something especially as she cried over the contract and continued to sob as she signed it  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a wordHer husband was an asshole too but thats a story for later,Not so fine print,372,TalesFromTechsupport,0,0,top_week
curriedavenger,14,46,1rbmxm,305,Sometimes you gotta feel bad for a guyThis was a slow day in the computer shop so its just me and the manager Mick in our small branch on university campus  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive  I say its possible but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and its likely to be expensiveAn hour later a guy that is the picture of middlemanagement rocks into our store out of breath and sweaty presenting a password protectedencrypted USB keyThis is itMick and share a glance at each otherIm the guy that called you earlier shouts the customer  You know about the data on the drive he pleadsMick takes a look at the drive and notes its a secure drive that encrypts the data on itWhat happened I askTurns out that the customers boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties  Because the customer was a contractor he was liable to lose his job over thisMick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering it would appear as gibberish since it was encryptedThe customers nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you takes the drive and leavesA couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer  a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me  He mentions the drive and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractors sister  This contractors laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmins friends very unhappy and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect  which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most peopleSysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive having been told it contained information pertaining to the universitys staff and payroll ie highly sensitive data for a protosystem to undergo testing with  While the actual project was real the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss Sysadmins friend Greg  Of course this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractors work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met  Greg couldnt actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractors inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himselfGreg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing  A simple task but importantIn spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone and data redundancy was an obvious step  At least until the rest of the storyThe contractor having forgotten the password destroying the supposedly only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced  When Greg found the drive a few days later plugged into the contractors computer FFS the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data  Understandably his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonestyAt this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughterI mean for fucks sake the password was the guys full name and extension number,Some things are worth remembering,351,TalesFromTechsupport,0,0,top_week

learn about her shiny new iPhone her first cell phone ever  The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a severalminutelong voicemail  I forwarded it to the boss who after listening for  seconds called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment hehWe never did figure out how she got my name or extensionTLDR The

ilawlfase,55,52,1rcyeh,251,Today I had a difficult call simply because of how not computer savvy my customer was  Somehow a tech came in installed a new gatewayand didnt tell her the password the nameand didnt even tell her she would have to connect to it  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasnt workingand she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first placeBut thats not even the call I wanted to tell you about  Todays call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up  Hed never had it before just a modem for his computer  Now he has a small Mac laptop  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didnt know much about Macs and until this job probably wouldnt have  But thats fine  I told him where the network name was and how to connect and how to input the password  Then as Im doing my ending and asking if theres anything else  He asks me So how far away can I use thisI was a little thrown off but I figured he has a large house  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extendersNo I mean  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat will I still be able to use itIm absolutely stumped  I knew hed never had wireless in his home but has he ever used it before in his life  When I told him that it doesnt work that way he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway  So i told him he could always get a hotspot that he can get from his cellphone companywe dont offer those  He asked me how much  I didnt know but estimated it might be around the cost of a cellphone bill  He continues asking me what good is his wireless then   I told him how its used and why its great  But its not safe to drive down the road with your laptop anyway  He eventually hung up sounding more than a little annoyed that his router wasnt strong enough to reach him  miles awayI fear we may hear of a man causing a large accident for using his laptop while driving soon,I want to use my Mac  miles down the road,303,TalesFromTechsupport,2998,1740,top_week

effingWitchDoctor,47,40,1r6dl6,230,Hello again TFTS Todays story takes place about  years ago at a small software company  people you probably havent heard of I was the network admin and did some inhouse scripting when I had time we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems This particular day we had one of those problemsWe had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing We were about  done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quickerJava is not a fast language Its great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them The powers that be bosses decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer VP who happened to start work on this very dayVP claimed to have  years of experience developing C He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prizeSo on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door EWD we just got a ticket from VP Apparently he cant access the development serverHuh I set him up and tested his account on Friday Forward it and Ill take a lookA few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and Im a little surprised It reads something to the amount ofi dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do hereIm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see whats amiss After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems I email him explain that Im the admin and ask if he can give me more information about the problem I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go A few minutes later I get the next emailhaha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss BB and have HIM fix this shitNow Im starting to get a little annoyed I email him back that Ill be over soon and deliberately waste  minutes looking at pictures of cats Feeling calmer I set off to figure out whats wrong only to find him about  feet away standing at the door to the server room Our server room like any server room should be is locked and airconditioned It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users Only the Head Techie HT the bosses and I have keys to this room anyone else must access it remotely Some use terminal editors directly into the server some pushpull with git all are welcome to use ftp but none are allowed in the roomI walk over to VP to explain this but as soon as he realizes who I am he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voiceIve been standing outside this door for  fucking minutes I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck inThe guy is practically shouting in my face Im shocked but quickly recover VP we dont go in there except for maintenance You can access it remotely using vim or git but no oneI DONT GIVE A SHIT IVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASSBy this point people have come out of their offices to see whats going on BB appears on scene and tells me to take  and let him sort it out I hear him calming VP as I walk offAt this point Im pissed It takes a lot to piss me off but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth After about a minute My Boss MB walks in and closes the door He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless so I just throw it out there years my ass How could someone develop for  years and not know how to edit code remotely What are they even doing over at otherCompanyI dont know I also dont know what BB is going to do about it That fella sure has a temperWe talk for a few minutes and theres a knock at the door BB VP and HT walk in VP has the most loathesome smirk Ive ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier BB looks as happy and clueless as everBB Ooooookay then Now that were all fine and dandy lets talk There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but theyre really easy fixes and heres what were going to do Were going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server VP also wants more monitors so were also gonna put a video card in it too EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because its his workstation And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind usBB is beaming MB and HT both look numb and I probably do too VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand Nothing personal buddyBB Great If anyone needs me Ill be in my officeBB and VP head out leaving HT MB and I doing our best someoneshotmydog faces We discuss it agree its ridiculous and they eventually leave to go carry it out I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new jobtldr we

RoninSpartan,17,32,1r251v,115,So have I got a tale for you One that has just happened fairly recently A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accusedA little background first though I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a workstudy picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had The offer to take on this position was made because of the server crashing of course the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures and them having  other IT personnel  of whom were under utilized but one ridiculously overpowered network adminThroughout this year after my hire I was able to implement a backup scheme with twotiers attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website learn about Server  to prepare the network to shift from a NovellGroupwise environment to a Windows NetworkingExchange environment and do most if not all of the grunt work of a workstudyThe storyNow because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services However there was one I had acquired administrative access to in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys Shortstuff leaving for another department within the college He had been dealing with the network admin for about  years and just got totally sick of it This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms events and such This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule sometimes it would get too busy to check or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didnt want to see it last minuteSo I read the manual about two months ago shortly after obtaining admin access and found out how to create IT work order notifications tested with one of the other users that book events for the college Success Now we and by we I mean I didnt have to manual check for work orders we were alerted at least  days in advance It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out although no one had mentioned it until last weekI had tried to figure out what could have happened I know I hadnt deleted anything and only added in that notification rule for IT I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldnt find where they might have been since I didnt see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules It puzzled me so I asked Shortstuff what could be going on he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset Ha well I didnt have access so I asked the network admin to look into it He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped I started to think what the hell could have happenedThe IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule or if I might have done something to that system I told him No I didnt delete anything I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert Come to find out yesterday the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime The IT director later that morning had walked into my office because of a FilePrint Server Cluster I was tasked to create I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else I was pissed I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything I looked at my IT director and was shocked So even though I didnt do anything I get my admin access taken away He just replied with Oh and stepped outIt was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry Shortstuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well he said to check the text he had just sent I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well In the huff and puff state the network admin was in without any notice or proper authorization took both my access and Shortstuffs administrative access from that systemWe decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didnt lose their administrative access This was directed toward us that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone elseMe and Shortstuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway when comes along Ladyblonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal She asked about what had happened and we let her know Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization and she uttered I think I might have done that She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought by removing those notification rules she was only removing herself from them I had an intense moment of joy and confidence for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all This was the last straw for Shortstuff and he is going to use it on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years to take down the network admin Later that evening just before I left to head home I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster He then mentioned about us not being at fault but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help Ladyblonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake without us telling her to We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his not just this one but many assumptions and wrongful accusationsWill keep you all informed of the result  Update I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such She has just recently started working here a few months back Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong he gave her a call She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending He stated about me He doesnt know what he is doing He went in the system and screwed something upGODOFIT  network adminUpdate  So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with He replied with This has happened in the past to Shortstuff before and I had talked with GODOFIT about it previously It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACEShortstuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GODOFIT will be on the Presidents desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw Shortstuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend  Shortstuff put up with GODOFITs shit for  years I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience We are supposed to have that meeting shortly this will definitely be a point that is brought uptldr strip my admin access and wrongfully accuse me youre going down mofo Edit they hired me cause they needed another IT guy to

deshe,24,41,1ri4te,175,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I recognized as Elijahs Listen I have a picture You get me A picture And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol Do you understand meHello Are you there I have a picture and IYeah yeah I heared you the first time Elijah Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background I guessedNo you

that guy Listen all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming oh my god I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

Cloudedguardian,38,19,1rcp13,96,Hi TFTS Ive been a lurker for over a year now and Im certainly no IT girl but I think this still counts and that youll all get a kick out of this I am known by my local friends as The Smart One and as such when one of my local friends had a tech issue Im often asked if I could sort it out for them Its often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button if not just turning it on and off againWell one day the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand Lets call her Red Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook as I had a rather nice laptop that Id gotten for graduation that I had to quote Done some cool crap with Well shes my friend and I like learning about computers so I figured I could give it a shotRed pulls out her Notebook turns it on and logs on before clicking Firefox to load up her internet My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up Im doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this and start asking the obvious questions To me anywayMe Well have you cleared out your cache recently It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your systemRed My whatNow I knew that there was a possibility I wasnt using the correct terms as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me Dad always called what I was thinking of The Cache and so I didnt know what else to call itMe Errr its like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web Some sites are especially bad for it and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them Cheezburger for instance Theres a program you run to clean it out let me see if you have onHere Reds Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off Oh no theres a button on that fox browser thing that does thatI blinked trying to figure out what she was talking about Then I realized that she was talking about the Data management window that you can bring up I resisted facepalming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused Me Errr no I think thats the browser cache Im talking about a different one on the computer itself sorry I might not be using the proper termsGranny Well I dont think clearing the computer is necessary the browser fixes that stuff Reds probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all upAt this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace As I struggle to get anything to load Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down As I searched for an anticirus a cleaner anything I said it was a possibility before giving up and asking her what antivirus she had She said she didnt know what I meantMe Like uh Norton or McAfee Red Oh No I aint got that WhyMe Well I think you might have a virus Theyre really easy for your computer to pick up if you dont have a proper antivirus Its probably whats gumming up your systemRed Ohhh What are you doingI was at that very second looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton I explained as such and Red told me bluntly not to I looked at her with a look of uttermostMe WutRed I downloaded somethin like that a little while ago and it just made things worse So dontI figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones and tried to explain that I think I lost her in the second sentence so I gave up and just said that it wasnt a Proper antivirus but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people She still wouldnt let me download it As she took her Notebook back with me conceding defeat I suggested that if she didnt want to download the free one she could always go to Staples and buy Norton I added that it was what I had and would clean repair and kill all the virus and it was very simple to use It was megaonsale at the moment and wouldnt be a bad idea She told me shed think about it but it was a lot of moneyAbout a week later my sister Black and I seen Red with a brand new laptop I asked her what happened with her Notebook and she said that since it was so slow shed just gone and bought a new one I blinked Me So it wasnt a virus Cleaning it didnt help Well that suRed Oh no I didnt clean it or nuthin I just chucked it and bought a new one insteadMe Wut Black Please tell me you didnt throw that Notebook in the trashRed Nah its too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash My friend actually wanted it if you can believe it So I let her have itMe Ddid you at least get Norton for your new computer Like does your new laptop have some sort of an antivirusRed Nah it doesnt need that junk Its all fast and new Im not gonna have any problems with this baby at allBlack You are going to become this stores best buckin friend aintcha AhouTLDR  Friend buys new laptop for over  rather than spending  on an antivirus,More Dollars than

IsilZha,29,20,1rghh8,96,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

TechGuy,35,8,1r518r,86,I have a small IT business in Austin One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N wireless router I had been to her house once before and met Bella her Great Dane she was friendly and pretty relaxedClient tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in She assures me that the dog is fine and to go inI open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps I didnt want to invade her territory without announcing myself first She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle it is yapping at me At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the factI set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat as the home owner suggested As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth This dog is huge and would fuck me up easilyI do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesnt pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing She get closer and I try to go around her She moves to block me so I back up and she gets closer We are just standing there her growling as I think Im about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but when I stop petting she starts growling Im sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on She doesnt really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave The client just moved into the house so she doesnt know anyone but says she is min away and headed my way She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her Yeah right This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with herIm petting Bella who now has her muzzle in my crotch as I scratch her ears If I screw with the pooch my balls are done Now Im like fuck it and call  and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave So Im just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next min petting her every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT mandog petterFinally an officer shows up Im just hoping that he doesnt walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bellas attention and finally make it outI go and talk to the officer to explain what happened he was really nice about it all and Im glad he saved my ass and Bella didnt meet her demise that day I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs He says Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog I really wasnt thinking about that at all when I said it I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit I owe him one for sureThe home owner shows up and the officer leaves Im speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is yo and normally they live to maybe  or  years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down that this is why she behaved that way She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave I really didnt feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for SaturdayI have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they dont bother me at all but Bella was old dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy My new policy is to never

Gambatte,30,8,1rg6w8,67,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the

Amaltron,15,6,1r5o8x,53,Hi TFTS first time poster long time readerLast Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subredditAn older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer He put his computer down and asked me to check it I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over  toolbars installed on his computer It took me a solid  minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer This included those fake antiviruses or programs that were easily removed So naturally my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over I checked to make sure that he had an antivirus and surprisingly found that he had one antivirus Microsoft Security Essentials So my first response is to open up Firefox After opening it and taking a bit he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up I noticed he had Chrome Firefox IE and Torch on the taskbar pinned It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars he called them games and pop ups showing up all the time So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was clean He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome He eventually had a lot of extensions pop ups etc with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didnt think too badly of it After downloading Malwarebytes I scanned his computer and after  minutes of scanning I found exactly  objects flagged by the program All I could think of is Holy Crap Ive never seen so many objects flagged by itAfter removing it the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working theretldr He made a sandwich The bologna went bad so he put salami on top of it thinking it will make it good again,Too many popups so Ill just download another browser,59,TalesFromTechsupport,434,3,top_week

FenrisFrost,13,2,1r678j,53,My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely This was significant An admin actually immediately resigned over it My immediate supervisor Lapdog to a more domineering one did nothing to defend us  as if to reinforce his impotency the email came from her with and Lapdog bolted on to her signature This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute Gov building in the dead center of a major American city and some bigwig walked through our IT area and didnt see enough going on So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time and not to expect much Then this gem for my department specifically the only IT people with laptops we are forbidden from working from home at all The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions are the exact words used Ironic considering A they gave us laptops and B we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines People outside IT use VPN constantly to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines and set their passwords to not expire because they dont come in for  months at a time But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady we have a pretty good rapport so our talk is usually casual That was a really bad idea I say I dont think so he says confidently Most people when they work from home they arent even working half the timeI nod Yeah but now youve made it so that on days when we cant make it here they wont be working at all I hear his Outlook notification go off just then Found out later it was one of his best admins giving his notice citing this policy change as his reason ,Good timing,55,TalesFromTechsupport,57,1,top_week

frozenfoxy,1,7,1r1o5q,48,So I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe Being the night owl I am I was all too happy to accept a position from AM to AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people Of course supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment  One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed It sounded interesting so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls Whenever the man turned it on it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed  Our first thought was some sort of virus and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over  days old Nope not a language barrier after all  About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the preinstalled antispyware program as well This came up with a lovely  or so hits Pretty high compared to most of his coworkers but not the highest we had ever encountered  With all these cleaned up we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved At this point the sun was starting to rise and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call Painfully he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup  Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer The man exclaimed immediately YOU ARE DOING THIS WHY It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer  He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office A good  to  popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisors screen as soon as he got into the system The first seven windows that had opened were dialup porn services either in Russian or English When asked about them the man stated they were vital to his work which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute  As we were calming down the door to the office opened It happens to sit very near our supervisors desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center After taking a few steps forward she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisors screen Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation Hes Russian The manager shook her head and left without a word a visible blush on her face causing our laughing to pick up again  We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily but even to the final day we worked there together wed all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn,Night of the Phantom Open Programs,55,TalesFromTechsupport,89,242,top_week
