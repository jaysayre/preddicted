Techsupportvictim,241,,678,1r5j3f,,1696,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

Today one of the sales guys comes to me and says that people can't hear him on his company mobile phone. He can ring people and they can hear him fine but when they call him and he's the one answering, the sound is muffled and quiet on both ends. 

So while he's standing in the office I ring his mobile phone and sure to god he picks the phone up, answers it and places it to his ear *the wrong way round*.

FredFltStn,175,,406,1r22gy,,1200,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

ender-_,264,,207,1rcenx,,858,"Recently we sold a computer to a client, for his friend. Pretty nice machine - i5 Haswell, 2TB disk, SSD, Geforce 660, 16GB RAM, Windows 8. Two weeks later he brings it back because it wouldn't boot. After some poking around, I noticed that the Software and System registry hives were empty, and looking on disk, the files that held them were only 256kB in size, but apparently the real hives were still there, just renamed to have .iobit extension (WTF?).

After I solved that, Windows slowly booted, logged in, desktop appeared, and after some half minute an animated snail appeared in the lower right corner with ""Computer speed: slow - optimize now!"" written under it. But before I could do anything, Windows froze (mouse pointer stopped moving, no disk activity, wouldn't respond to ping). Since the same thing happened after several reboots, I went into Safe Mode and looked at Programs and Features: 3 Start Menu replacements (one we provided, two installed later), 5 different optimizers, several Registry cleaners, countless toolbars. As there were other problems (registry permissions were screwed up so badly that you couldn't change view modes in Explorer), I simply reinstalled Windows (and upgraded to 8.1, which came out that day).

Techsupportvictim,40,,189,1ral73,,842,"Gent comes in to our store a couple of weeks ago. Issue with his laptop. I don't actually recall what the issue was in the end but we needed to send it to our repair depot. At least three days out of his hands, as many as seven. 

He needed to back up his stuff cause apparently he never had in the almost year he had had it. So we had gotten him a hard drive, showed him out to set it up etc. 

Game plan, he goes home, backs it up and then drops it off and we send it out. With luck they don't have too many machines and it's back fast. 

Roll forward two weeks and he comes in to drop it out off morning. Saturday. To be shipped via a third party that doesn't pick up on Saturdays to go to a center that isn't open on Sundays anyway. 

I'm not the one doing the paperwork but I can hear the whole thing from my post.

Tech taking it in tells him that it will go out Monday with luck by delivered back on Wednesday, maybe Thursday. 

To wit the guy yells out him that he is leaving to go out of the country first thing Monday morning and must have his computer for the trip. Now remember this all started two weeks ago and we could have sent it out that day if he'd been backing it up like a good user (double since he uses this for business it seems) 

The tech explains to him that this is not a repair we can do in store because we don't have the proper tools and parts and they would take a week to arrive even if we could get them. And according to the notes he knew two weeks ago what needed to be done. All very calmly.

The guy yells for a manager and our lead tech comes over. Hears the whole convo, hears the guy ranting about 'what are you going to do about it'  and with a totally calm and straight face simply replies

Rhywden,119,,113,1r99ob,,629,"This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a medium-sized students' dormitory (~500 connected clients).

Physical layout consisted of 4 houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches, thus providing 100 Mbit connections. 

So, one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door: ""Internet is down!""

First thing to check: Local issue? Tried connecting to the router remotely - no dice. Not only is the ""Internet down"" but the whole network. Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking, also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked. Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than I'll ever learn.

However, he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error. Uplink - fine. No errors in the logs. Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active ones!
We tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything. TCPdump didn't show any incoming traffic on our network facing card.

Until, by pure chance (or maybe desperation?), we rebooted the switches. Because the network suddenly came to life again... and ground to a halt mere seconds later.

Okay, time for another reset, this time with TCPdump to watch what's happening. And that's when we saw it: A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros (yes, even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port) and just one single 0x0F somewhere. And it flooded the network for the short time it worked.

We then worked out what had obviously happened: Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they _appeared_ to still be working (I kid you not, if you didn't watch them closely you'd notice nothing - it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didn't change over time as it usually would in a live network).

The solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again. That way we discovered the culprit - who wasn't home at the time (of course). He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC (which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download) had bluescreened which obviously didn't agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could.",The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport

curried_avenger,49,,121,1rbq0v,,549,"Follow up story to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1rbh79/not_so_fine_print/)

As I said before, I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront, with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customers.

Now, like most service departments, the technicians don’t work weekends, but the retail department is open 7 days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up - no real issue, it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekends.

It was a busy Sunday, which was unusual for this particular store, and staff were handling customers.  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store - no big deal, it’s where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section, so the staff think nothing of it.  Nothing, until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock room.

Turns out, one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friend’s laptop, and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store) before their friend had class on Monday.  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for, within reason, it didn’t matter to management when the work was done.

He starts pulling on the door, which is locked by key-card access.  He then starts knocking.

The technician, a lovely lady in her mid-twenties, was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement.  Having seen this guy, she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the door’s window.

The man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperation.

“Is she fucking ignoring me?!”

The customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out.  I thank him and move over to stop this guy’s impatience from escalating.  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help with.

“You guys need to sort this out.  I’m here to pick up my wife’s laptop, and your staff are all ignoring me.  That one out back is on the fucking phone!  I’m parked in a loading zone and I can’t wait.”

I apologise and say I will get things moving.  I look up the guy’s job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier.  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary, his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next, from about ten days ago.  We only heard back from her on Wednesday, four days ago, to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered, installed and the system tested.

“I know that, but obviously I’m here now and I’m not leaving without it.”

Now, I have two options.  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with the other parts), or I could tell this guy that technicians don’t work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period, unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service (twice the regular hourly charge) for the entirety of the job (with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash, if she agrees to do it).

“This is bullshit - I can see her back there.  Right now, I am looking at her right now,” he said as he pointed at her.  “She was on the fucking phone.  You should prioritise your customers in the store, for fucks sale.  What kind of outfit is this?”

At this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole, and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants.  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today, and I explain why that was not going to happen:

* Technicians do not work on weekends;
* His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked;
* The girl in the back was not working today; and
* I could fast-track the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon, at no extra charge, if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machine.

This took the better part of fifteen minutes.  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday, having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit.  He leaves the store in a huff.  

Two minutes later, he returns.

Meltingteeth,132,,116,1rguyg,,570,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

dalgeek,55,,67,1rforv,,415,"In this age of high speed computing and security, keeping accurate time is a must.  Some people just depend on time.windows.com, some use Tier2 NTP sources on the Internet, while others go the extra mile and buy their own GPS-driven time-keeping appliance.  I mean, what could be more reliable than having a highly accurate time source right on your own low-latency network?

I get a call from a customer one morning ""All of the phone systems are down!  Call processing, call centers, everything!""  I VPN in and start checking alerts; all sorts of strange alerts, mostly regarding invalid security certificates, but also database replication errors.  I check the certificates and they're still valid.  Database replication won't rebuild no matter what I do.  Agents can't log in even with correct passwords.  As I check the system status the date scrolls by quickly and I do a double take: April 1992?

Everything is sync'ed to NTP so that's the first place I look.  Sure enough, the NTP appliance seems to think it is 1992.  Due to some obscure hardware failure, the appliance lost GPS lock and decided to pick an arbitrary date in 1992 as the current time.  It would have been better if the thing just stopped working completely instead of giving out false time.  I shut down the network port on the appliance and added its IP address to the core switch so that everything could get somewhat correct time.  The network and databases slowly came back to life as the time was fixed.

Pretty much everything that depended on SSL or Kerberos failed.  The certificates were invalid not because they had expired, but they were not yet active!  Some systems happily set their clock back to 1992 because the NTP server said so, while others said ""waaait a minute"" and ignored the obviously erroneous time; now those two systems can't talk to each other.

TL;DR SSL and temporal anomalies don't mix.",Computers don't like time travel,482,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,72,,84,1rduku,,372,"Before the beginning, there was nothingness - a void so complete that the passage of time - even the very concept of time itself - was meaningless. Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits (having brought them with it, because - as one would expect by it's very definition - the larder of the eternal void was quite empty), and generally just messed up the whole boundless void. With a sigh, entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruption.

*Shortly after that,* I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths (PFY) when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment. Being a simple job, I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said check.

He promptly returned bearing the bad news: the coolant levels were low, and would require replenishment.

Seeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs, of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously, I assembled the group and informed them of said task.

&gt; ME: Any questions?

&gt; PFY: This coolant... Is it hazardous? What PPE (personal protective equipment) should we be using?

*Oh ho,* I thought, *A learning opportunity.*

&gt; ME: Excellent question, PFY. I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop. From there, you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to. So your job is now...

&gt; PFY: ...to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we need?

&gt; ME: Well done. Once you've done that, gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin - I'll come up to make sure that you do it properly.

So the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described. I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details as:

&gt; **Specific personal protective equipment:**

&gt; *Respiratory:*

&gt; None required.

&gt; *Eyes:*

&gt; Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquid.

&gt; *Hands:*

&gt; Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplated.

&gt; *Other clothing and equipment:*

&gt; Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vapor.

and

&gt; Compound is known as ""the universal solvent"" and does dissolve, at least to some extent, most common materials. 

So after a considerable period of time (far longer than it should have taken, really, but not longer than I had expected), I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedure.

I arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields, rubber aprons, rubber boots, and rubber gloves. A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on, ready to engage should the first two be overcome.

*This seems a little excessive,* I thought. Aloud, I instructed them to begin.

As it turns out, the PFYs had broken the task up into groups. The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling. Of course, he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do so.

As the coolant began to pour into the system, a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding 'dihydrogen monoxide' actually was...

*****

**FALLOUT:**

The PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety, then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS database.

The devious PFY was promoted to 2IC a few months later, and is still one of the very best I've ever had.

After about 3 trips I have settled into a fast and simple routine which allowed me to get the job done in about a day. The key component of  this routine, that's important to this story, is the laying out of all my cabling and equipment. 1 pile of blue ethernet cables, 1 pile of red, and one pile of orange fiber jumpers.

curried_avenger,34,,53,1rbh79,,317,"I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store.  We specialised in Apple products, and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customers.

One day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working, as she “can’t check her email”.  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all, and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard, requiring the computer to be formally booked into our on-site service system to arrange for parts and service.  I informed her of our (labour) prices, explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed within.

Having agreed to that, I begin getting her details to be entered into our system.  She gives me her phone number, but when I ask for an address…

“You don’t need that, actually.”


Now, how she expects to know what I need I didn’t understand, and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront - particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed, so we can’t really take prior payment since we don’t know what the extent of the repairs will be.

“I don’t want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyers.”

I explain that our service centre’s database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department, and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there.  I also explain that without a billing address our check-in software will not process the repair.

She reluctantly agrees, and I print out the form for her to sign.  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand (despite having a pen in front of her anyway) and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request - the ones pertaining to contact details.  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to *this particular service job* and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entity.

I ask her what she is doing.  

“I don’t want to be harassed by telemarketers.”

I ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with (not that I can negotiate different terms, but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson).  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her *under this very contract* is to speak with her in respect to this repair job, and show her the wording that says just that.  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation, and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of terms.

“Just get it done”.

She slides the service agreement towards me, grabs her handbag and walks out.  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it, given that I have not yet signed off on it.  The computer is in limbo and I can’t do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed.  However, I do have her phone number.  

I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it, and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned.  As it was not currently working, it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up, unless she requests that we hold onto it.  Naturally, she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us.  I inform her that there is a storage fee of $10 per day until the service request is completed.

She starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that it’s grabbing the attention of our other customers, even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all day.

A few hours later she storms into the store, with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson - a 16 year old girl - about how we are extorting her.  I step in and apologise for making her come back, and get the new agreement printed out.  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her, staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement as-is or leave with her computer.

She then goes quiet, and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hit…and starts sobbing.  Sobbing, and reading the terms she had earlier deleted.  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something, especially as she cried over the contract, and continued to sob as she signed it.  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a word.

Her husband was an asshole, too, but that’s a story for later.",Not so fine print,370,TalesFromTechsupport
curried_avenger,14,,46,1rbmxm,,303,"Sometimes, you gotta feel bad for a guy.

This was a slow day in the computer shop, so it’s just me and the manager (Mick) in our small branch, on university campus.  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive.  I say it’s possible, but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and it’s likely to be expensive.

An hour later a guy that is *the* picture of middle-management rocks into our store, out of breath and sweaty, presenting a password protected/encrypted USB key.

“This is it.”

Mick and share a glance at each other.

“I’m the guy that called you earlier,” shouts the customer.  “You know, about the data on the drive?” he pleads.

Mick takes a look at the drive, and notes it’s a secure drive that encrypts the data on it.

“What happened?”, I ask.

Turns out that the customer’s boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information. The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive, not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties.  Because the customer was a contractor, he was liable to lose his job over this.

Mick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts.  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering, it would appear as gibberish since it was encrypted.

The customer’s nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you, takes the drive, and leaves.

A couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer - a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me.  He mentions the drive, and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractor’s sister.  This contractor’s laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmin’s friends *very* unhappy, and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case.  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing, and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect - which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most people.

Sysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive, having been told it contained information pertaining to the university’s staff and payroll (i.e. highly sensitive data), for a proto-system to undergo testing with.  While the actual project was real, the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss, Sysadmin’s friend, Greg.  Of course, this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractor’s work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met.  Greg couldn’t actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractor’s inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himself.

Greg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password, and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing.  A simple task, but important.

In spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat, since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone, and data redundancy was an obvious step.  At least, until the rest of the story:

The contractor, having forgotten the password, destroying the (supposedly) only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced.  When Greg found the drive a few days later (plugged into the contractor’s computer FFS), the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty.  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor, the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data.  Understandably, his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonesty.

At this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughter.

lawtechie,21,,55,1r15nt,,300,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",355,TalesFromTechsupport

squigglechicken,72,,49,1r2ucm,,289,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.

Somehow, a tech came in, installed a new gateway...and didn't tell her the password, the name....and didn't even tell her she would have to connect to it.  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasn't working...and she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first place.

But that's not even the call I wanted to tell you about.  Today's call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company.  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up.  He'd never had it before, just a modem for his computer.  Now he has a small Mac laptop.  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didn't know much about Macs and until this job, probably wouldn't have.  But that's fine.  I told him where the network name was, and how to connect and how to input the password.  Then as I'm doing my ending and asking if there's anything else.  He asks me: ""So how far away can I use this?""


I was a little thrown off, but I figured he has a large house.  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extenders.

""No, I mean.  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat, will I still be able to use it?""
I'm absolutely stumped.  I knew he'd never had wireless in his home, but has he ever used it before in his life?  When I told him that it doesn't work that way, he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway.  So i told him he could always get a hotspot that he can get from his cellphone company....we don't offer those.  He asked me how much.  I didn't know, but estimated it might be around the cost of a cellphone bill.  He continues asking me what good is his wireless then.   I told him how it's used, and why it's great.  But it's not safe to drive down the road with your laptop anyway.  He eventually hung up, sounding more than a little annoyed that his router wasn't strong enough to reach him 50 miles away.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

pyro-genesis,23,,34,1r1kgu,,233,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,47,,38,1r6dl6,,230,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

OldPolishProverb,7,,29,1r8b6k,,216,"IBackground; I work in a college IT department. Our IT work area is one large common room. One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass. You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home.

I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didn't like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it. He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift. What was happening is that the film lost its ""stick"" after being pulled off an put back on day after day for a couple of weeks.

mdsnbelle,34,,32,1r8mwy,,208,"Backstory: I support a school system.

Our middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting.  The elementary schools don't. After a couple of cycles of trying to guess for the reporting, I finally convinced my boss to make this a full-on directive from the Superintendent.  It went out in August with reminders in September and October.

After several schools failed to comply, we identified our bad eggs, sent them to the head of the IT department, and he distributed them to the  schools that haven't complied.

the_unusual_suspect,15,,21,1r9cpz,,177,"So this was maybe a year ago, but I just haven't sat down to right about it.

I used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits. They also resold T1 circuits, and things of that nature. On top of that, they also provided point-to-point wireless access, VOIP, webhosting, and e-mail.

Providing support for resold internet really isn't as bad as you think -- especially considering I was T2, and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center. Simple stuff. And VOIP never really caused any issues.

What did cause issues was e-mail. 

We actually hosted our own e-mail server. I couldn't tell you what we used off the top of my head right now, but it was linux based (all of our software was). And that's fine -- it was free and simple. Only... it wasn't updated regularly... or ever.

So eventually we arrive to the day in question. 

As you may have guessed, we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question. Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form, so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted. Well, we started receiving a series of... interesting emails. After a quick google search it turns out it's a very basic SQL injection used to, essentially, retrieve the password for an email account. Thing is if you grab the right one... say our network administrators email password, well... that's when the trouble can start (especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins). Or so I thought -- it's actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using. I'll get into that in a minute.

So, me and my co-worker inform our network admin. He takes a look, and bans the IP abusing the form. That was it. Fantastic. We have no idea whats been accessed. I inform everyone I can, and they assure me our network admin will take care of it. And that is that, as they say.

Well, not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam. Our internal email accounts, and our customer email accounts. It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs. I'm talking verizon, yahoo, charter -- it was just unbelievable. So as our network admin is ""looking for a solution"" me and my coworker investigate on our own.

Now, i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right. Well guess what? Email is hosted via that server as well. Which isn't that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHING.

So, how it works if you're unfamiliar is as follow.

SSH into our server (we allowed the access). And from there all you had to do was keep '..'ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts. Oh, and you didn't need a password to get into them. YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT. One other thing -- sudo commands freely fucking available. And there's our god damned problem.

So now we're a god damned ISP that, when I check, was responsible for .01% of the entire spam coming across the internet. That's a shit load.

Of course this was immediately brought up to our network admin, and the owner. I don't know how to emphasize absolute and total despair, but they DIDN'T FUCKING BELIEVE US. You know what they blamed it on? Spoofing. FUCKING SPOOFING. Sorry, it still infuriates me.

They tried implementing ""solutions"" but nothing really panned out -- which you know, is because someone had unfettered access to our shit. It was a constant fight until the day I quit. My coworker quit the same day. It was interesting.

A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home.

FenrisFrost,51,,23,1r7yh4,,154,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

PotatoRoll,60,,22,1r88u6,,139,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

I was still mad when I typed this, but I feel a lot better now.

Gambatte,29,,19,1r0tjr,,133,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

RoninSpartan,17,,30,1r251v,,119,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---
GOD_OF_IT = network admin

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

She kept telling me ""it's not popping up to install"". I told her that she needed to check her downloads window in Firefox (which was popped up on the screen). She couldn't see the file clearly labeled so she proceeded to download it again and again and again..... So finally she listens to me, finds the download window and installs it. Cool, Java is up to date now so let's start the test. Re-open Firefox and go to the testing site. She instead opens Chrome and goes to the site.

I tell him to hang on while I find another monitor cable, and dig a DVI cable out of the server room.

I unplug the VGA cable and shove it through the desk grommet, plug in the DVI and push it through.  Go around and under the desk to feed it back up to the laptop dock and it's just a hair short. I get it through the grommet near the dock and go back topside.  

I need to move the dock to the right a couple inches, but there's nearly no slack in the cables.  I wrestle it over, but it's nearly touching his desk phone, so I try to move that over.  It moves maybe a half inch.

Back under the desk, the cables had been ""managed"" within an inch of their lives. The dude who did the cable management used short screws and the keyhole hangers on the surge protector to get it out of the way, then cheap, one-way zip ties on those self-adhesive loops to get the cables off the floor.  There's zero slack anywhere.  The zip-ties can't be cut with scissors, and I don't want to take a razor to them. The guy had apparently pulled the zip-ties too tight, as the loose DVI cable works fine.  

I shake my head, apologize for the interruption, and question the wisdom of using a dude who had never in his life done cable management to do cable management.

TL;DR: Who knew you could strangle a VGA cable until it made the monitor blue in the face?

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

Cloudedguardian,38,,21,1rcp13,,95,"Hi TFTS, I've been a lurker for over a year now, and I'm certainly no IT girl, but I think this still counts, and that you'll all get a kick out of this. 

I am known by my local friends as 'The Smart One"", and as such, when one of my local friends had a tech issue, I'm often asked if I could sort it out for them. It's often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button, if not just turning it on and off again.

Well one day, the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand. Let's call her Red. Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook, as I had a rather nice laptop that I'd gotten for graduation that I had, to quote, ""Done some cool crap with."" Well, she's my friend, and I like learning about computers, so I figured I could give it a shot.

Red pulls out her Notebook, turns it on, and logs on, before clicking Firefox to load up her internet. My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up. I'm doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this, and start asking the obvious questions. (To me anyway)

Me: ""Well, have you cleared out your cache recently? It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your system.""

Red: ""My what?""

Now I knew that there was a possibility I wasn't using the correct terms, as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family, and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me. Dad always called what I was thinking of ""The Cache"" and so I didn't know what else to call it.

Me: ""Errr, it's like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web. Some sites are especially bad for it, and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them. Cheezburger, for instance. There's a program you run to clean it out, let me see if you have on-""

Here Red's Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off. ""Oh no, there's a button on that fox browser thing that does that.""

I blinked, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was talking about the ""Data management"" window that you can bring up. I resisted face-palming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms, and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused. 

Me: ""Errr, no, I think that's the browser cache. I'm talking about a different one on the computer itself, sorry, I might not be using the proper terms.""

Granny: ""Well I don't think clearing the computer is necessary, the browser fixes that stuff, Red's probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all up.""

At this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch, and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace. As I struggle to get anything to load, Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down. As I searched for an anti-cirus, a cleaner, *anything*, I said it was a possibility, before giving up and asking her what anti-virus she had. She said she didn't know what I meant.

Me: Like, uh, Norton, or McAfee? 

Red: Oh. No I ain't got that. Why?

Me: Well, I think you might have a virus. They're really easy for your computer to pick up if you don't have a proper anti-virus. It's probably what's gumming up your system.

Red: Ohhh. What are you doing?

I was, at that very second, looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned, with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton. I explained as such, and Red told me bluntly not to. I looked at her with a look of uttermost

Me: Wut.

Red: I downloaded somethin' like that a little while ago and it just made things worse. So don't.

I figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones, and tried to explain that. I think I lost her in the second sentence, so I gave up and just said that it wasn't a ""Proper"" anti-virus, but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people. She still wouldn't let me download it. As she took her Notebook back, with me conceding defeat, I suggested that, if she didn't want to download the free one, she could always go to Staples and buy Norton. I added that it was what I had, and would clean, repair, and kill all the virus, and it was very simple to use. It was mega-on-sale at the moment, and wouldn't be a bad idea. She told me she'd think about it, but it was a lot of money.

About a week later my sister (Black) and I seen Red with a brand new laptop. I asked her what happened with her Notebook, and she said that since it was so slow, she'd just gone and bought a new one. I blinked. 

Me: So it wasn't a virus? Cleaning it didn't help? Well that su-

Red: Oh no I didn't clean it or nuthin', I just chucked it and bought a new one instead.

Me: Wut. 

Black: Please tell me you didn't throw that Notebook in the trash.

Red: Nah, it's too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash. My friend actually wanted it, if you can believe it. So I let her have it.

Me: D-did you at least get Norton for your new computer? Like, does your new laptop have some sort of an anti-virus?

Red: Nah, it doesn't need that junk. It's all fast and new, I'm not gonna have any problems with this baby at all.

Black: You are going to become this store's best buckin' friend, ain't'cha, Ahou?

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport

Today, they outdid themselves.

**Ring ring**

Me: *** Servicedesk, this is dreadpirate15. 

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

We were immediately rewarded with the sound of an old register coming to a wheezy sort of life.

lawtechie,24,,25,1r39ta,,92,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away.

Tale One - Thou Shall Not Steal


Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,35,,8,1r518r,,82,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Gambatte,14,,11,1r406j,,86,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

A woman calls up and needs some remote troubleshooting done, she says her screen has gone blank. It's determined that the monitor has died after being left on 24-7 for 5 years or so, and a new one gets sent out. 

The woman is concerned about hooking it up herself. My co-worker explains to her what a VGA cable is, and that it's a big blue box and all she has to do is plug the new one into the wall with one cable and attach the new cord with the blue box on the computer.

FenrisFrost,8,,11,1r5ce7,,79,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves.

squigglechicken,5,,12,1r2dr9,,66,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. That's terrible.""

lawtechie,17,,8,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,72,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

I work as a Tape Backup Operator for a large banking corporation.  My job description: Sit on ass until there's a ticket submitted to either enter or eject tapes into large robotic libraries.

Today is going to be a long Monday...
Ticket initially submitted at 12:03pm EST to eject 
130 (We'll call it Series 1) tapes.  After ~30 minutes, OverseasGuy requests we return the ticket with no other explanation.  Meh, fine...whatever.  I already dragged a metal cart that holds 240 tapes upstairs and across the building to get 'em...but whatever.  So I haul the cart back downstairs to our storage area, and go back to my lunch which he so rudely interrupted.  

We receive the ticket again at 1:56pm EST changing it from 130 Series 1 tapes to 200 Series 2 tapes.  32 tapes are ejected (after telling OverseasGuy we can do 39 at a time...that's how much the door holds...for some reason this library has issues setting up a queue like the other machines, so they have to do it one door at a time).  I close the door waiting for the next set....nothing.  Multiple attempts to contact OverseasGuy were made with no response.  At 3:01pm EST, OverseasGuy comes back with ""Sorry, i was at lunch""; machine ejects 32 more (mind you, I've already instructed the operator it can eject 39 per door) tapes.  No more activity...it's now 3:22pm EST.

Edit:  It is now 4:05pm EST, the last 39 are ejecting out of the machine now!  From 12:03pm to past 4pm (I leave at 4:30...woohoo!), an operation was completed that usually takes no more than half an hour!

Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.

I took an intimidating battle stance. I stared at him. I locked eyes. The extended silence had no affect on his disposition. His eyes were dead.


""Did you order a rack or a tower?""


""I'm not going to order the server until the week of the install so we can maximize utilizing the warranty."" He talks like a brochure when he knows he's in trouble. Since, even when he eats lunch he's in over his head, he talks like a moron all the time.


""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in. I have no issues with dropping everything else to rush getting it configured with the OS properly installed and updated, and the new software that we have never seen or worked with before installed and configured.
If you get your timing right, I’ll take it out of the box on the day of the install. I understand that three weeks time is crucial to maximize a warranty."" I was angry. This was my best, most eloquent sarcasm.

I click internet explorer and it stops responding. Okay I'll try chrome.. It stops responding too.. Okay I'll use task manager, go to their processes and kill the process tree. Task manager froze too.. Alright I'll reboot into safe mode with networking and download the free trial version of AVG. It downloads fast in safe mode installs and then I reboot. Run avg and it said it found over 1000 infected files! I let it do its thing but it took so long that i had to wait till the next day to finish up.

I come into shop. Fast forward last theory and im in lab. I check her laptop and not only did avg remove all the viruses it made it more faster and tolerable to use. I open internet explorer and no waiting its fast and responds like its supposed to. I open task manager and it doesn't freeze or crash. I opened chrome and it ran great i decided to download a random wallpaper to replace the black one the viruses put. Dragged it to the desktop. Changed the wallpaper and dragged it to the recycle bin but I accidentally dragged a photo that wasnt what I used there so i open up recycle bin and..

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up. 

After that several more times she would bring it back with the same problem only different exuses and sometimes she wouldn't even speak and i kept her privacy but it got to the point where avg no longer could do it job and I had to format and reinstall windows. Months later she donated it to the shop but never said why. Now that I think about it it had some kind of smeared residue near the track pad..

I work grunt level support for the uni I attend. Mostly my duties include answering phones, fixing people's moble wireless settings, and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support.  However, during the summers, some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers. New purchases are imaged, added to a domain, and have special software deployed based on where its going. Old relics leaving service  are KillDisc-ed, scavenged for parts, and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling. Its not a bad gig.


In order to maintain some degree of CYA, when computers arrive to be out-processed and recycled we keep them for 15 days before wiping them. This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine, it can still be recovered. Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience. 

Too bad that ""Most of the time"" is not "" All of the time""

This particular incident began with me arriving, caffeine in thermos, book in hand, for another day of processing. I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen, noting the paperwork. According to the paperwork, I can wipe it.  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights. ( I used to sing Daisy, Daisy while i worked, but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath, I laughed and said "" no im just grunt support"" )

I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed ""Professor. Derpingtons"" computer yet. I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me. Then, as if it were fate, I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on, lo and behold its Derpington's. 

""Not boss, I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press go""

""Well the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so don't kill it yet""

""Ok, should I get his files off for him?""

""No he says he needs them ASAP, Hes coming here to get them""

I double take, Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility. Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map.  The idea of a Bambi-eyed professor navigating our wire strewn, technological reliquary of a faculty is novel, if not terrifying. 

Soon the professor arrives, luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before. I walk him through several rooms, each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation. I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him. He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files. 

I step away for while, I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files. So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves. The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime, based on the volume of the fans. 

""Sir, are you done?"" I move to turn the monitor back on ""I can shut it down and walk you to the exit""

""NO WAIT"" he reaches out to stop me.

I reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight. The windows file transfer dialog, with its loading bar, animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive. 

Hold on.....

300GB of files are being moved.....

from a folder labeled ""NOT PORN"".......

My discovery happens in an instant, and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again. 

""that is private, Students should not be rooting through professors files!""

""yes sir, my mistake"" I begin walking out "" Give me a call when your finished"". I round the corner and keep walking, I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away, I double over and laugh for a while. eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington, Lord of Not Pornia. 

""So what happens now?"" he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine. I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data. He demands that he wants to witness the wiping, ""for security reasons"". I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was 300GB of Not porn was...""For Science"". But he stood by for 40 minutes as killdisc did its magic. 

I escorted him out and he thanked me and my boss, promising to ""put in a good word for IT because of our good work here"".  As he left, I avoided shaking his hand. 

Edit: the're in there with their bear.

Amaltron,15,,5,1r5o8x,,52,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

tl;dr He made a sandwich. The bologna went bad so he put salami on top of it thinking it will make it good again.","Too many popups, so I'll just download another browser!",57,TalesFromTechsupport

I had this phone call happen to me earlier. I work as a Help Desk/Network Specialist/Hardware/Software/Systems Admin/Network Admin/Jack of all Trades person at a small time local computer service company in my city. It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive! Most of my calls are helping retired old ladies learn their new Windows 8 computers, replacing the ink cartridges for them (as we do house calls as well), or cleaning out spyware and the like.

McFurty: Oh! Hey there! Oh my, I'm so glad I got a hold of y'all. My computer, it isn't working! I tried holding down the button at the bottom waiting for all the lights to come off and then on again and I tried unplugging it and plugging it back on but nothing!

Prof X: I'm sorry to hear you're having issues getting you're computer to turn on, Mrs. McFurty. Let's see what we can do to get you back up and running again. I'm just gonna ask some basic questions first to get started.

McFurty: Well okay!

Prof X: Are there any lights currently on the front of the PC or is there any picture going to your monitor? 

McFurty: Prof. X is there any way you can come over today? I mean, my husband has some checks to send out and we really need the computer to work.

Prof X: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but unfortunately I already have appointments scheduled for later this afternoon at the opposite side of town, I can make you an appointment for Monday if you really want me to be there in person to troubleshoot.

McFurty: Wait! It looks like somethings happening!

Prof X: How do you mean? Could you tell me if there's anything on the screen or lights on the PC?

McFurty: YES! THERE IS! OH, PRAISE JESUS! IT LOOKS LIKE IT HEALED ITSELF WHILE I WAS AT BIBLE STUDY!

FenrisFrost,13,,1,1r678j,,52,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*."" 


I hear his Outlook notification go off just then. Found out later it was one of his best admins giving his notice, citing this policy change as his reason. ",Good timing,53,TalesFromTechsupport

frozenfoxy,1,,8,1r1o5q,,45,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,53,TalesFromTechsupport

rat_in_your_basement,27,,20,1rejzv,,43,"I'm my own stupid user in this story. This is from back when I still had a Win XP SP3 (on a 64-bit processor at that), and had zero IT experience. I'm hazy on the technical details, and have no clue how I got the virus in the first place, but here goes:

I started to run into this issue with my web browsers (except for Rockmelt, the virus wasn't compatible with Rockmelt), where clicking on links in a Google search window would cause me to be redirected to a very shady looking site full of even shadier advertisements. Like hell are there only fifteen local singles in my area. I had Malwarebytes, but after dozens of failed scans, I was able to conclude that whatever it was that made it onto my computer would cause a BSOD upon detection. Being inexperienced, I either had no clue about all of Malwarebytes' little tools to get around that, or they didn't exist back then.

One way or another, I decided to try my luck with encryption. Google (unbeknownst to most of the world) runs an [encrypted version of their search engine](https://encrypted.google.com), and I ended up relying heavily on it, as it seemed to get around the malicious software. 

A little while later, I installed [Windows Network Monitor](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=4865) and ran an unencrypted Google search. Upon doing the search, Network Monitor told me what file had accessed the internet and caused my redirect. Upon scanning it with MBAM, BSOD. No huge surprise. I considered simply deleting it, but Windows 7 had just come out, and that was just one of many issues that had accumulated on that machine over the years.

My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

So it's Monday. Boring morning class as usual, but a text message from my dad picks my attention. ""Are you busy this evening? Aunt Bernadette called. Problems with computer""
Sure. I personally love helping people when they have computer problems, so sure. Why not?

Fast forward to the evening. We arrive at my aunt's house. A bit of chitchat and she informs me about the problem. Appearantly internet doesn't work. I check the modem. Everything seems fine. Ofcourse, since her iPad can connect to the internet. 
I take a look at her computer. It's a brand new HP with Windows 8.1 on it. It's not connected to a network. I as what her password it and try it. ""Incorrect password""
After a few attempts (in case I typed wrong), still nothing. 
Weird.
It's the correct network though, so I ask if she is sure about this password. 
""Yes yes ofcourse. It's weird because I can access my emails and facebook with that password on my iPad""

Then a bell rings.
Hold on, is she talking about the password of her accounts?
I take a look at the documents from the ISP and see the password for the network (something like A2388CDhuZa8...). Connect again with that password, and bam! Connected!

dennisthetiger,5,,11,1rc4hk,,38,"So it came to pass that, when I went to work for $mobile_company, I received training.

OK, no problem.  I already had a small amount of tech-savvy under my belt, was running my own Linux based web server off of a DSL connection (YAY ME!) with its own hosted DNS (ooh, l33t!), and had a fair understanding of things.  All in all, was a pretty easy job.

Well, of course, on the first day of any employ, there will be the words from the IT guy.

We had this man named Frank. Frank is a big guy.  Frank looks scary.  Frank can be mean.

He gave us The Speech.

""This is my network,"" he said.  ""There are thousands - nay, millions - like it, but this one is mine.  I run it, I am responsible for it.

""You will not modify my network.

""You will not install unauthorized software, override my firewall, or even insert a USB key drive into any computer in this network, or I will know about it. This network will notify me.

""You **will not**,"" he emphasized, ""go to Myspace^1.  I **hate** Myspace^2.  You will not release proprietary data.  If you do, I will be coming to your desk.  You DO NOT want me coming to your desk.""

Usual Q&amp;A ensues.

This, ladies and gentlemen, was my introduction into the world of information technology: a man faced the new hires and gave what I now refer to as the Speech Of Doom.  And I decided that one thing, aside from the computer maintenance and network operations and and and that comes with IT, one thing I decided I wanted to do was give that speech to the new hires some day.

I have modified my own, just in case I ever meet the day where I am allowed to give this speech.  I plan on threatening the theft of the soul of the policy violators through their pupils - in a way that is so painful, there will be no anesthetic that could ever hope to kill that pain.

And Frank?  Don't piss him off.  Nice guy, but I've seen him pissed.  Good news: it was never at me.

SkraeNocturne,8,,7,1r8y9u,,30,"So, my client has tasked me with replacing computers in the warehouse and on the production floor.  Last month, their IT/DB person quit to go to another job, and I'm still ecstatic for her (employee satisfaction at this client is almost nonexistent, it was worst for her).  We're coming up on a month and a half, and I'm only just now hearing from my boss that they're going to be hiring somebody because they were convinced that they would never need a database person again.

Back to the story, one of the computers on my replacement list is one they use for &lt;large shipping company well known for their orange and purple logo&gt; shipping, and use &lt;shipping company&gt;'s proprietary software.  All well and fine.  I'm doing my best not to have to call their tech support, even though my limited experience with them has been great.  Low wait times, quick resolution.

Right now, I'm having trouble with the database integration since I don't have any documentation on what databases are what, where do they pull info, etc.  I have been implicitly forbidden by the client from asking &lt;previous DB person&gt; what I need to do for anything around here, nor do I want to remind her of the ""system"" here.  So I ask their EDI guy, and the guy they keep around because the owner is too softhearted to let him go because he's been around here since the dawn of time, even though he doesn't technically have a job to do anymore, and hasn't for some time now (probably since the start of the information age, I would guess).  But since he has had experience with their EDI system from a decade ago, I've been told to talk to him if there's a problem.  Let's call him Dan.

I just got done speaking with him because I was out of options:

ME:  Hey, Dan, do you know what data source the shipping data is pulled from?

DAN:  That would be &lt;Access database&gt;.  *Fuck*

ME:  I'm pretty sure it needs to pull from SQL...

DAN:  No, here, let me bring up &lt;Access database&gt; and show you.

ME:  *Crap...*  Ok, but I really don't think this is what I need to do...

DAN:  No, no, here.  See these tables?  That stores the shipping info, so you need to import these three tables into &lt;shipping company software&gt;.

ME:  *trying to GTFO* Great, I think that might be what I needed.  I've got a few other things I need to take care of before I head out (at that point, in ten minutes).

DAN:  Yeah, just a minute.  So these tables talk to eachother in the &lt;Access database&gt; and have all the shipping info, and...

ay_gov,2,,4,1r5zu4,,29,"Two instances of people who should know better not knowing better...  To be fair they are contractors so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.


**Instance the First**

I receive an email request with probably 7 people involved in the email chain. AD account with local server admin rights needed for an application install.

I go through the requisite steps of setting up the account, applying the expiration date, restricting the logon to that application server, adding admin rights on that application server.  Quick and easy!

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.  Well, the person he has cc'd is tech illiterate (read: my OS is Internet Explorer) so I'm not that fussed.  Return to my coffee and indulge in some Reddit....

Until I receive yet another email.  This time it's the project coordinator from the company replying to everyone in the email chain.... with the email I sent to the tech with his account details as an attachment.  Holy hell , Batman!  Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.

Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,22,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago.

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
samurai-technician,4,,23,1r9aqc,,3,"Recent tales told here reminded me of this poignant vignette...


The winter of 1993 shimmers lithely in distant memory. My company was two groups: the artsy-fartsy liberals at the far end of the building deeply engrossed in their oh-so-important work for humanity and the technical group that made it all possible at the other end of the building.


The only technically competent individual in the artsy fartsy group was ironically the oldest, with one foot out the door and one deeply engrossed. His 'weltanschauung' was enlightening, he was always smiling--or perhaps smirking, and he drank coffee whose beans were roasted after they passed through a Lemur's ass. He was the only one of both ends of the building who had acquired a 9600 baud modem from the company at large. He knew how to work it too, boy. We didn't have to show him 'nuthin'. Our operations were on 1200 baud modems and less, and this guy gets to have his own 9600 baud modem.


He knew the AT command set and that commanded respect.


During the third shift, we, and when I say we, I mean mostly--if not only I would sit at his station--on his PC. We would dial in to the local BBS and...be part of the nascent internet. I would later have to defend my 'abuse' of the equipment and phone records of dialing into what was called...The Love Connection BBS? What I learned by doing this turned into knowledge to save the day that one time.


One day, during NBH, he reports to me a connectivity issue. He can dial up and connect, but cannot use Telix or Procomm to get any further. He demonstrates entirely from the various command lines. Probably something to do with that PPTP stuff. 


I call the local ISP...the only one channel in the galaxy...of cheap, reliable PINE and GOPHER play. He and I even had an email address from them--a real novelty. The kid at the help desk begins his script.


He had me go through all the standard stuff--turning this and that off, typing this and this command, even reloading DOS, and after about twenty minutes finally admits that they are experiencing problems and this is most likely related.

Techsupportvictim,241,,674,1r5j3f,,1700,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

FredFltStn,175,,408,1r22gy,,1193,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

Rhywden,119,,117,1r99ob,,625,"This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a medium-sized students' dormitory (~500 connected clients).

Physical layout consisted of 4 houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches, thus providing 100 Mbit connections. 

So, one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door: ""Internet is down!""

First thing to check: Local issue? Tried connecting to the router remotely - no dice. Not only is the ""Internet down"" but the whole network. Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking, also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked. Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than I'll ever learn.

However, he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error. Uplink - fine. No errors in the logs. Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active ones!
We tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything. TCPdump didn't show any incoming traffic on our network facing card.

Until, by pure chance (or maybe desperation?), we rebooted the switches. Because the network suddenly came to life again... and ground to a halt mere seconds later.

Okay, time for another reset, this time with TCPdump to watch what's happening. And that's when we saw it: A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros (yes, even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port) and just one single 0x0F somewhere. And it flooded the network for the short time it worked.

We then worked out what had obviously happened: Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they _appeared_ to still be working (I kid you not, if you didn't watch them closely you'd notice nothing - it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didn't change over time as it usually would in a live network).

The solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again. That way we discovered the culprit - who wasn't home at the time (of course). He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC (which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download) had bluescreened which obviously didn't agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could.",The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport

As I said before, I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront, with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customers.

Now, like most service departments, the technicians don’t work weekends, but the retail department is open 7 days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up - no real issue, it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekends.

It was a busy Sunday, which was unusual for this particular store, and staff were handling customers.  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store - no big deal, it’s where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section, so the staff think nothing of it.  Nothing, until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock room.

Turns out, one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friend’s laptop, and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store) before their friend had class on Monday.  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for, within reason, it didn’t matter to management when the work was done.

He starts pulling on the door, which is locked by key-card access.  He then starts knocking.

The technician, a lovely lady in her mid-twenties, was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement.  Having seen this guy, she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the door’s window.

The man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperation.

“Is she fucking ignoring me?!”

The customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out.  I thank him and move over to stop this guy’s impatience from escalating.  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help with.

“You guys need to sort this out.  I’m here to pick up my wife’s laptop, and your staff are all ignoring me.  That one out back is on the fucking phone!  I’m parked in a loading zone and I can’t wait.”

I apologise and say I will get things moving.  I look up the guy’s job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier.  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary, his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next, from about ten days ago.  We only heard back from her on Wednesday, four days ago, to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered, installed and the system tested.

“I know that, but obviously I’m here now and I’m not leaving without it.”

Now, I have two options.  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with the other parts), or I could tell this guy that technicians don’t work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period, unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service (twice the regular hourly charge) for the entirety of the job (with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash, if she agrees to do it).

“This is bullshit - I can see her back there.  Right now, I am looking at her right now,” he said as he pointed at her.  “She was on the fucking phone.  You should prioritise your customers in the store, for fucks sale.  What kind of outfit is this?”

At this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole, and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants.  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today, and I explain why that was not going to happen:

* Technicians do not work on weekends;
* His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked;
* The girl in the back was not working today; and
* I could fast-track the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon, at no extra charge, if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machine.

This took the better part of fifteen minutes.  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday, having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit.  He leaves the store in a huff.  

Two minutes later, he returns.

Meltingteeth,132,,118,1rguyg,,572,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

dalgeek,55,,66,1rforv,,417,"In this age of high speed computing and security, keeping accurate time is a must.  Some people just depend on time.windows.com, some use Tier2 NTP sources on the Internet, while others go the extra mile and buy their own GPS-driven time-keeping appliance.  I mean, what could be more reliable than having a highly accurate time source right on your own low-latency network?

I get a call from a customer one morning ""All of the phone systems are down!  Call processing, call centers, everything!""  I VPN in and start checking alerts; all sorts of strange alerts, mostly regarding invalid security certificates, but also database replication errors.  I check the certificates and they're still valid.  Database replication won't rebuild no matter what I do.  Agents can't log in even with correct passwords.  As I check the system status the date scrolls by quickly and I do a double take: April 1992?

Everything is sync'ed to NTP so that's the first place I look.  Sure enough, the NTP appliance seems to think it is 1992.  Due to some obscure hardware failure, the appliance lost GPS lock and decided to pick an arbitrary date in 1992 as the current time.  It would have been better if the thing just stopped working completely instead of giving out false time.  I shut down the network port on the appliance and added its IP address to the core switch so that everything could get somewhat correct time.  The network and databases slowly came back to life as the time was fixed.

Pretty much everything that depended on SSL or Kerberos failed.  The certificates were invalid not because they had expired, but they were not yet active!  Some systems happily set their clock back to 1992 because the NTP server said so, while others said ""waaait a minute"" and ignored the obviously erroneous time; now those two systems can't talk to each other.

Gambatte,72,,83,1rduku,,376,"Before the beginning, there was nothingness - a void so complete that the passage of time - even the very concept of time itself - was meaningless. Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits (having brought them with it, because - as one would expect by it's very definition - the larder of the eternal void was quite empty), and generally just messed up the whole boundless void. With a sigh, entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruption.

*Shortly after that,* I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths (PFY) when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment. Being a simple job, I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said check.

He promptly returned bearing the bad news: the coolant levels were low, and would require replenishment.

Seeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs, of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously, I assembled the group and informed them of said task.

&gt; ME: Any questions?

&gt; PFY: This coolant... Is it hazardous? What PPE (personal protective equipment) should we be using?

*Oh ho,* I thought, *A learning opportunity.*

&gt; ME: Excellent question, PFY. I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop. From there, you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to. So your job is now...

&gt; PFY: ...to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we need?

&gt; ME: Well done. Once you've done that, gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin - I'll come up to make sure that you do it properly.

So the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described. I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details as:

&gt; **Specific personal protective equipment:**

&gt; *Respiratory:*

&gt; None required.

&gt; *Eyes:*

&gt; Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquid.

&gt; *Hands:*

&gt; Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplated.

&gt; *Other clothing and equipment:*

&gt; Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vapor.

and

&gt; Compound is known as ""the universal solvent"" and does dissolve, at least to some extent, most common materials. 

So after a considerable period of time (far longer than it should have taken, really, but not longer than I had expected), I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedure.

I arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields, rubber aprons, rubber boots, and rubber gloves. A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on, ready to engage should the first two be overcome.

*This seems a little excessive,* I thought. Aloud, I instructed them to begin.

As it turns out, the PFYs had broken the task up into groups. The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling. Of course, he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do so.

As the coolant began to pour into the system, a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding 'dihydrogen monoxide' actually was...

*****

**FALLOUT:**

The PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety, then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS database.

The devious PFY was promoted to 2IC a few months later, and is still one of the very best I've ever had.

curried_avenger,34,,50,1rbh79,,322,"I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store.  We specialised in Apple products, and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customers.

One day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working, as she “can’t check her email”.  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all, and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard, requiring the computer to be formally booked into our on-site service system to arrange for parts and service.  I informed her of our (labour) prices, explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed within.

Having agreed to that, I begin getting her details to be entered into our system.  She gives me her phone number, but when I ask for an address…

“You don’t need that, actually.”


Now, how she expects to know what I need I didn’t understand, and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront - particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed, so we can’t really take prior payment since we don’t know what the extent of the repairs will be.

“I don’t want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyers.”

I explain that our service centre’s database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department, and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there.  I also explain that without a billing address our check-in software will not process the repair.

She reluctantly agrees, and I print out the form for her to sign.  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand (despite having a pen in front of her anyway) and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request - the ones pertaining to contact details.  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to *this particular service job* and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entity.

I ask her what she is doing.  

“I don’t want to be harassed by telemarketers.”

I ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with (not that I can negotiate different terms, but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson).  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her *under this very contract* is to speak with her in respect to this repair job, and show her the wording that says just that.  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation, and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of terms.

“Just get it done”.

She slides the service agreement towards me, grabs her handbag and walks out.  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it, given that I have not yet signed off on it.  The computer is in limbo and I can’t do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed.  However, I do have her phone number.  

I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it, and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned.  As it was not currently working, it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up, unless she requests that we hold onto it.  Naturally, she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us.  I inform her that there is a storage fee of $10 per day until the service request is completed.

She starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that it’s grabbing the attention of our other customers, even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all day.

A few hours later she storms into the store, with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson - a 16 year old girl - about how we are extorting her.  I step in and apologise for making her come back, and get the new agreement printed out.  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her, staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement as-is or leave with her computer.

She then goes quiet, and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hit…and starts sobbing.  Sobbing, and reading the terms she had earlier deleted.  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something, especially as she cried over the contract, and continued to sob as she signed it.  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a word.

curried_avenger,14,,46,1rbmxm,,305,"Sometimes, you gotta feel bad for a guy.

This was a slow day in the computer shop, so it’s just me and the manager (Mick) in our small branch, on university campus.  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive.  I say it’s possible, but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and it’s likely to be expensive.

An hour later a guy that is *the* picture of middle-management rocks into our store, out of breath and sweaty, presenting a password protected/encrypted USB key.

“This is it.”

Mick and share a glance at each other.

“I’m the guy that called you earlier,” shouts the customer.  “You know, about the data on the drive?” he pleads.

Mick takes a look at the drive, and notes it’s a secure drive that encrypts the data on it.

“What happened?”, I ask.

Turns out that the customer’s boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information. The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive, not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties.  Because the customer was a contractor, he was liable to lose his job over this.

Mick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts.  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering, it would appear as gibberish since it was encrypted.

The customer’s nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you, takes the drive, and leaves.

A couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer - a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me.  He mentions the drive, and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractor’s sister.  This contractor’s laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmin’s friends *very* unhappy, and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case.  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing, and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect - which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most people.

Sysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive, having been told it contained information pertaining to the university’s staff and payroll (i.e. highly sensitive data), for a proto-system to undergo testing with.  While the actual project was real, the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss, Sysadmin’s friend, Greg.  Of course, this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractor’s work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met.  Greg couldn’t actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractor’s inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himself.

Greg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password, and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing.  A simple task, but important.

In spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat, since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone, and data redundancy was an obvious step.  At least, until the rest of the story:

The contractor, having forgotten the password, destroying the (supposedly) only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced.  When Greg found the drive a few days later (plugged into the contractor’s computer FFS), the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty.  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor, the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data.  Understandably, his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonesty.

At this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughter.

lawtechie,21,,57,1r15nt,,295,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",352,TalesFromTechsupport

squigglechicken,72,,51,1r2ucm,,283,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

So I asked him how I was going to get 6 analog COs through the 4 pair wire, and he said ""dont know what to tell you, its my job to know this equipment and I am right. You might want to hire a inside wiring tech to check it out"".  Whatever, I ask for his supervisor.  Get hung up on, and a supervisor calls back a few minutes later.  He was very helpful and immediately saw a programming error in the hardware that resolved the problem.

I told the guy that the Tier1 tech was being an ass and obviously needs some training.  When I get bad techs I usually just get the ""its a big company and I am not sure who you talked to"" line.  But this guy said ""he sits 10 feet away from me, and I am taking care of it right now"".

SirEDCaLot,54,,42,1r4i39,,256,"This takes place several years ago.  I'd just been hired by a small independent IT firm.  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

-----

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:** This is EDC (first name), how can I help you?

**Caller:**  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot (first and last name) at $company?  (she knows my name and extension...)

**Me:**  Yes it is!  What can I do for you today?

**Caller:**  Well I'm having a problem with my Apple Silver computer it's probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card (impossible, my cards didn't exist yet) and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thing?

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Caller:**  ...blah blah blah...So I really don't know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and he's on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library (remember she has a Mac) and I'm almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire me?

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

FINALLY, 20+ minutes later, am holding a now-disconnected phone, staring at a New Account screen with nothing but a first name...

Epilogue:  Boss wasn't too impressed with my IM (ignoring customers = bad), but seemed to understand my explanation.  We both felt bad for the woman but there's not much we could do to help, we couldn't afford to sit on the phone for hours.

The woman called back two weeks later, seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation, but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy, and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone (her first cell phone ever).  

The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a several-minute-long voicemail.  I forwarded it to the boss, who (after listening for 30 seconds) called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment... heh

ilawlfase,55,,52,1rcyeh,,251,"Today I had a difficult call simply because of how not computer savvy my customer was.  Somehow, a tech came in, installed a new gateway...and didn't tell her the password, the name....and didn't even tell her she would have to connect to it.  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasn't working...and she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first place.

But that's not even the call I wanted to tell you about.  Today's call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company.  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up.  He'd never had it before, just a modem for his computer.  Now he has a small Mac laptop.  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didn't know much about Macs and until this job, probably wouldn't have.  But that's fine.  I told him where the network name was, and how to connect and how to input the password.  Then as I'm doing my ending and asking if there's anything else.  He asks me: ""So how far away can I use this?""


I was a little thrown off, but I figured he has a large house.  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extenders.

""No, I mean.  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat, will I still be able to use it?""
I'm absolutely stumped.  I knew he'd never had wireless in his home, but has he ever used it before in his life?  When I told him that it doesn't work that way, he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway.  So i told him he could always get a hotspot that he can get from his cellphone company....we don't offer those.  He asked me how much.  I didn't know, but estimated it might be around the cost of a cellphone bill.  He continues asking me what good is his wireless then.   I told him how it's used, and why it's great.  But it's not safe to drive down the road with your laptop anyway.  He eventually hung up, sounding more than a little annoyed that his router wasn't strong enough to reach him 50 miles away.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

pyro-genesis,23,,31,1r1kgu,,233,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,47,,40,1r6dl6,,230,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change.

the_unusual_suspect,15,,23,1r9cpz,,178,"So this was maybe a year ago, but I just haven't sat down to right about it.

I used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits. They also resold T1 circuits, and things of that nature. On top of that, they also provided point-to-point wireless access, VOIP, webhosting, and e-mail.

Providing support for resold internet really isn't as bad as you think -- especially considering I was T2, and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center. Simple stuff. And VOIP never really caused any issues.

What did cause issues was e-mail. 

We actually hosted our own e-mail server. I couldn't tell you what we used off the top of my head right now, but it was linux based (all of our software was). And that's fine -- it was free and simple. Only... it wasn't updated regularly... or ever.

So eventually we arrive to the day in question. 

As you may have guessed, we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question. Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form, so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted. Well, we started receiving a series of... interesting emails. After a quick google search it turns out it's a very basic SQL injection used to, essentially, retrieve the password for an email account. Thing is if you grab the right one... say our network administrators email password, well... that's when the trouble can start (especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins). Or so I thought -- it's actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using. I'll get into that in a minute.

So, me and my co-worker inform our network admin. He takes a look, and bans the IP abusing the form. That was it. Fantastic. We have no idea whats been accessed. I inform everyone I can, and they assure me our network admin will take care of it. And that is that, as they say.

Well, not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam. Our internal email accounts, and our customer email accounts. It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs. I'm talking verizon, yahoo, charter -- it was just unbelievable. So as our network admin is ""looking for a solution"" me and my coworker investigate on our own.

Now, i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right. Well guess what? Email is hosted via that server as well. Which isn't that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHING.

So, how it works if you're unfamiliar is as follow.

SSH into our server (we allowed the access). And from there all you had to do was keep '..'ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts. Oh, and you didn't need a password to get into them. YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT. One other thing -- sudo commands freely fucking available. And there's our god damned problem.

So now we're a god damned ISP that, when I check, was responsible for .01% of the entire spam coming across the internet. That's a shit load.

Of course this was immediately brought up to our network admin, and the owner. I don't know how to emphasize absolute and total despair, but they DIDN'T FUCKING BELIEVE US. You know what they blamed it on? Spoofing. FUCKING SPOOFING. Sorry, it still infuriates me.

ViolentLambs,40,,32,1r7gk3,,165,"I went to a vocational school for three years (10th-12th grade) and I took electronics and robotics. A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home. Installed windows seven and happily took the PC to its owner in computer office technology.

I don't know that client didn't notice or at least check for those roach things.. That was the first time I ever encountered something like that. My instructor wasn't too pleased that I left his bag out there but as happy that we didn't get some kind of infestation or something..

FenrisFrost,51,,22,1r7yh4,,153,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,150,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?!

PotatoRoll,60,,22,1r88u6,,137,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

I was still mad when I typed this, but I feel a lot better now.

Gambatte,29,,20,1r0tjr,,129,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

RoninSpartan,17,,32,1r251v,,115,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

GOD_OF_IT = network admin

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

We are supposed to have that meeting shortly, this will definitely be a point that is brought up.

effingWitchDoctor,8,,21,1r8pky,,116,"Hi again, TFTS. 

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

tl;dr: a party of at least 6 is required to defeat a top-tier illiteratus and we were duoing, so we ran.

We do not have a lab for this for whatever reason so the students have to do testing on their personal laptops. The particular college I was working with today uses a pretty bad testing site, I don't want to say which but it's pretty bad. Java always needs to be the most current version, Flash needs to be current and Firefox seems to be the only browser we don't have issues with which isn't a huge deal, but not everyone keeps their PC or Mac up to date which causes problems.

A student raises her hand and I walk over to her. She is having an issue with her test. It appears to be a Java issue so the first thing I tell her to do is go to Java.com to see if she has the latest version. She does not so I have her download Java. She kept telling me ""it's not popping up to install"". I told her that she needed to check her downloads window in Firefox (which was popped up on the screen). She couldn't see the file clearly labeled so she proceeded to download it again and again and again..... So finally she listens to me, finds the download window and installs it. Cool, Java is up to date now so let's start the test. Re-open Firefox and go to the testing site. She instead opens Chrome and goes to the site.

Me ""Please open Firefox""

Her ""But I don't like using Firefox""

Me ""I understand, but the developer recommends using Firefox""

Her ""I don't want to use Firefox because I have the website book marked in Chrome.""

Me ""Open Firefox please""

Her ""Okay, fine""

Me ""In the address bar, type in www.testingsite.com""

Her ""Oh, that was all?""

Me ""Yes""

I walk past his office the other day and his monitor is decidedly blue.  I stop, turn around, and ask him about it. He's got no idea, it just started happening that morning.  I ask him about the VGA cable from the monitor to his dock, he says he replugged it at both ends but it didn't help.  I'm busy and technically not IT anymore, so I shrug, tell him to try a reboot and if it doesn't work, call $DerpContractIT.  

He hollers at me the other a couple days ago (his office is 6' away from my cubicle) and I pop my head into his office.  Monitor is still blue, and he's got an Excel sheet open that's almost unreadable.  I futz with the settings on the OSD (with him helpfully chiming in that he can't mouse-click on the OSD - thanks, Captain Dumbass), but nothing makes a difference. I tell him to hang on while I find another monitor cable, and dig a DVI cable out of the server room.

I unplug the VGA cable and shove it through the desk grommet, plug in the DVI and push it through.  Go around and under the desk to feed it back up to the laptop dock and it's just a hair short. I get it through the grommet near the dock and go back topside.  

I need to move the dock to the right a couple inches, but there's nearly no slack in the cables.  I wrestle it over, but it's nearly touching his desk phone, so I try to move that over.  It moves maybe a half inch.

Back under the desk, the cables had been ""managed"" within an inch of their lives. The dude who did the cable management used short screws and the keyhole hangers on the surge protector to get it out of the way, then cheap, one-way zip ties on those self-adhesive loops to get the cables off the floor.  There's zero slack anywhere.  The zip-ties can't be cut with scissors, and I don't want to take a razor to them. The guy had apparently pulled the zip-ties too tight, as the loose DVI cable works fine.  

I shake my head, apologize for the interruption, and question the wisdom of using a dude who had never in his life done cable management to do cable management.

TL;DR: Who knew you could strangle a VGA cable until it made the monitor blue in the face?

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

Cloudedguardian,38,,19,1rcp13,,96,"Hi TFTS, I've been a lurker for over a year now, and I'm certainly no IT girl, but I think this still counts, and that you'll all get a kick out of this. 

I am known by my local friends as 'The Smart One"", and as such, when one of my local friends had a tech issue, I'm often asked if I could sort it out for them. It's often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button, if not just turning it on and off again.

Well one day, the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand. Let's call her Red. Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook, as I had a rather nice laptop that I'd gotten for graduation that I had, to quote, ""Done some cool crap with."" Well, she's my friend, and I like learning about computers, so I figured I could give it a shot.

Red pulls out her Notebook, turns it on, and logs on, before clicking Firefox to load up her internet. My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up. I'm doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this, and start asking the obvious questions. (To me anyway)

Me: ""Well, have you cleared out your cache recently? It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your system.""

Red: ""My what?""

Now I knew that there was a possibility I wasn't using the correct terms, as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family, and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me. Dad always called what I was thinking of ""The Cache"" and so I didn't know what else to call it.

Me: ""Errr, it's like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web. Some sites are especially bad for it, and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them. Cheezburger, for instance. There's a program you run to clean it out, let me see if you have on-""

Here Red's Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off. ""Oh no, there's a button on that fox browser thing that does that.""

I blinked, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was talking about the ""Data management"" window that you can bring up. I resisted face-palming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms, and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused. 

Me: ""Errr, no, I think that's the browser cache. I'm talking about a different one on the computer itself, sorry, I might not be using the proper terms.""

Granny: ""Well I don't think clearing the computer is necessary, the browser fixes that stuff, Red's probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all up.""

At this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch, and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace. As I struggle to get anything to load, Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down. As I searched for an anti-cirus, a cleaner, *anything*, I said it was a possibility, before giving up and asking her what anti-virus she had. She said she didn't know what I meant.

Me: Like, uh, Norton, or McAfee? 

Red: Oh. No I ain't got that. Why?

Me: Well, I think you might have a virus. They're really easy for your computer to pick up if you don't have a proper anti-virus. It's probably what's gumming up your system.

Red: Ohhh. What are you doing?

I was, at that very second, looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned, with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton. I explained as such, and Red told me bluntly not to. I looked at her with a look of uttermost

Me: Wut.

Red: I downloaded somethin' like that a little while ago and it just made things worse. So don't.

I figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones, and tried to explain that. I think I lost her in the second sentence, so I gave up and just said that it wasn't a ""Proper"" anti-virus, but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people. She still wouldn't let me download it. As she took her Notebook back, with me conceding defeat, I suggested that, if she didn't want to download the free one, she could always go to Staples and buy Norton. I added that it was what I had, and would clean, repair, and kill all the virus, and it was very simple to use. It was mega-on-sale at the moment, and wouldn't be a bad idea. She told me she'd think about it, but it was a lot of money.

About a week later my sister (Black) and I seen Red with a brand new laptop. I asked her what happened with her Notebook, and she said that since it was so slow, she'd just gone and bought a new one. I blinked. 

Me: So it wasn't a virus? Cleaning it didn't help? Well that su-

Red: Oh no I didn't clean it or nuthin', I just chucked it and bought a new one instead.

Me: Wut. 

Black: Please tell me you didn't throw that Notebook in the trash.

Red: Nah, it's too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash. My friend actually wanted it, if you can believe it. So I let her have it.

Me: D-did you at least get Norton for your new computer? Like, does your new laptop have some sort of an anti-virus?

Red: Nah, it doesn't need that junk. It's all fast and new, I'm not gonna have any problems with this baby at all.

Black: You are going to become this store's best buckin' friend, ain't'cha, Ahou?

IsilZha,29,,20,1rghh8,,96,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

We were immediately rewarded with the sound of an old register coming to a wheezy sort of life.

lawtechie,24,,24,1r39ta,,92,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away.

Tale One - Thou Shall Not Steal


Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,35,,8,1r518r,,86,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Gambatte,14,,11,1r406j,,86,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

I work at the IT department of a pretty big University, and despite being a SysAd, sometimes I have to field calls, as we have no regular helpdesk.

One day a woman calls in, she says she needs help because she ""can't receive e-mails"" for several days now. I ask her the usual questions to help me understand her setup (is she using our Web Mail or Thunderbird, etc), but either she doesn't understand at all what I'm talking about, or she is being difficult on purpose.

FenrisFrost,8,,11,1r5ce7,,75,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves. 

TLDR; Your first reaction shouldn't be to blame something we tested successfully for months. ",It looks like it works to me.,86,TalesFromTechsupport

squigglechicken,5,,14,1r2dr9,,68,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. That's terrible.""

Lexmark Tech: ""Yeah... ummmm... call back tomorrow... I guess?""

lawtechie,17,,8,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,8,1rg6w8,,67,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

I work as a Tape Backup Operator for a large banking corporation.  My job description: Sit on ass until there's a ticket submitted to either enter or eject tapes into large robotic libraries.

Today is going to be a long Monday...
Ticket initially submitted at 12:03pm EST to eject 
130 (We'll call it Series 1) tapes.  After ~30 minutes, OverseasGuy requests we return the ticket with no other explanation.  Meh, fine...whatever.  I already dragged a metal cart that holds 240 tapes upstairs and across the building to get 'em...but whatever.  So I haul the cart back downstairs to our storage area, and go back to my lunch which he so rudely interrupted.  

We receive the ticket again at 1:56pm EST changing it from 130 Series 1 tapes to 200 Series 2 tapes.  32 tapes are ejected (after telling OverseasGuy we can do 39 at a time...that's how much the door holds...for some reason this library has issues setting up a queue like the other machines, so they have to do it one door at a time).  I close the door waiting for the next set....nothing.  Multiple attempts to contact OverseasGuy were made with no response.  At 3:01pm EST, OverseasGuy comes back with ""Sorry, i was at lunch""; machine ejects 32 more (mind you, I've already instructed the operator it can eject 39 per door) tapes.  No more activity...it's now 3:22pm EST.

Edit:  It is now 4:05pm EST, the last 39 are ejecting out of the machine now!

Well my first post worthy of posting on reddit...


A girl brought in her laptop, she said that she was doing some ""research for school"" and then all of a sudden she started getting a lot of popups and now her computer is super slow, etc.

I ran a virus scan, removed some malware, whatever.

The best part of this story...

when I restarted her computer and went to her browser to check if it was running properly... It popped up saying her previous session closed unexpectedly, did she want to restore the previous pages...

Out of habit, I clicked yes.

Well, I know why she had a virus...

the pages it restored were 4 different tabs of google searches of... I shit you not... ""Justin Bieber Naked!"" and  ""Justin Bieber Penis"" and ""Justin bieber hot nude"" and there was one other but it was too much so I just closed them all out...

_cegorach_,6,,7,1rfy1d,,59,"Today my department was lucky enough to move a handful of staff members from a temporary location into their permanent spot now that their renovations are complete. This wasn't too difficult, just time consuming since we had to go back to just about every cube after we had finished to make some adjustment for the staff member. We also had to setup a temporary location for various staff members to interact with students. 

Couple hours after we had finished moving their stuff I receive a ticket from one of the staff members that their mouse was not working intermittently. The ticket was ended with the following: 
&gt;she does not know her current location due to the moves. 

I had helped set up her station, so I knew right where it was, and I was able to get the problem fixed and the ticket closed relatively quickly. About 10 minutes later I see the ticket had been reopened because she didn't mean her desk, she meant the temporary desk she was currently using.

smokeybehr,19,,8,1r2cf4,,58,"Inspired by /u/FredFltStn and his tales of printer woes.

I get a panicked call from one of the branches that a printer has been printing out multiples of the same document over and over until the printer is shut off, and when the printer is turned back on, it keeps printing. I tell them to leave the printer off, and that I'd be right out. 

When I get there, I hear the tales of woe from the staff, and go about checking everything. I check the workstation, the print server, the release station, and ask the staff if the customer had wanted more than one copy. Nothing indicated anything out of the ordinary. 

I turned the printer on, and it proceeded to start spitting out multiple copies of the document that had been printing previously. I mashed the heck out of the Cancel Job button to stop it. I test printed a document from one of the staff computers, and the same thing happened. 

I went back to the printer and began flipping through the menus, and there it was.

""Copies: 65534"" 

Apparently, one of the youthful customers (to put it politely) had been messing around with the printer settings, and had set the printer to this ungodly copy count. I reset the copy count back to 1, and tested again with success. 

It was after this little incident that I began remotely managing the network attached printers, and locked down the control panels on all of the public printers. ",Copies: 65534,66,TalesFromTechsupport

One day I'm chilling in shop messing around with our little Lego NXT robot and Z walks in. I graduated with her and she was a weird and crazy one but she comes in, calls me over, and asks for a repair form. I hand her one, fills it out real quick, and I ask her what problems she's having. 

After a short discussion she tells me that its incredibly slow and she thinks it has a virus. I tell her I get started on it and check back tomorrow. I put it on my bench hook up its charger power dat dell on and waited what felt like ten minutes. I get to the logon and she didn't give me her password. I thought well since she's Gone and I can't leave shop I think its time I pull out the ol paragon rescue kit. This is the best software I have ever used at gaining access to files and computers clients forgot to give me passwords for. I kept in my instructors office because in the wrong hands you could do some real evil with that disc because you boot it like an os install disc. It scans the hard drive and wipes ALL the passwords giving me administrator access to what ever I please. Fast forward about 20min and I'm in, get to her desktop and the horror.. This could turn into tech support gore.. You know those ads that can Change your mouse cursor, basically anything you should never click. She had no anti-virus witch doesn't surprise me. I click internet explorer and it stops responding. Okay I'll try chrome.. It stops responding too.. Okay I'll use task manager, go to their processes and kill the process tree. Task manager froze too.. Alright I'll reboot into safe mode with networking and download the free trial version of AVG. It downloads fast in safe mode installs and then I reboot. Run avg and it said it found over 1000 infected files! I let it do its thing but it took so long that i had to wait till the next day to finish up.

I come into shop. Fast forward last theory and im in lab. I check her laptop and not only did avg remove all the viruses it made it more faster and tolerable to use. I open internet explorer and no waiting its fast and responds like its supposed to. I open task manager and it doesn't freeze or crash. I opened chrome and it ran great i decided to download a random wallpaper to replace the black one the viruses put. Dragged it to the desktop. Changed the wallpaper and dragged it to the recycle bin but I accidentally dragged a photo that wasnt what I used there so i open up recycle bin and..

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up. 

After that several more times she would bring it back with the same problem only different exuses and sometimes she wouldn't even speak and i kept her privacy but it got to the point where avg no longer could do it job and I had to format and reinstall windows. Months later she donated it to the shop but never said why. Now that I think about it it had some kind of smeared residue near the track pad..

I work grunt level support for the uni I attend. Mostly my duties include answering phones, fixing people's moble wireless settings, and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support.  However, during the summers, some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers. New purchases are imaged, added to a domain, and have special software deployed based on where its going. Old relics leaving service  are KillDisc-ed, scavenged for parts, and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling. Its not a bad gig.


In order to maintain some degree of CYA, when computers arrive to be out-processed and recycled we keep them for 15 days before wiping them. This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine, it can still be recovered. Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience. 

Too bad that ""Most of the time"" is not "" All of the time""

This particular incident began with me arriving, caffeine in thermos, book in hand, for another day of processing. I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen, noting the paperwork. According to the paperwork, I can wipe it.  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights. ( I used to sing Daisy, Daisy while i worked, but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath, I laughed and said "" no im just grunt support"" )

I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed ""Professor. Derpingtons"" computer yet. I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me. Then, as if it were fate, I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on, lo and behold its Derpington's. 

""Not boss, I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press go""

""Well the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so don't kill it yet""

""Ok, should I get his files off for him?""

""No he says he needs them ASAP, Hes coming here to get them""

I double take, Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility. Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map.  The idea of a Bambi-eyed professor navigating our wire strewn, technological reliquary of a faculty is novel, if not terrifying. 

Soon the professor arrives, luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before. I walk him through several rooms, each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation. I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him. He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files. 

I step away for while, I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files. So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves. The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime, based on the volume of the fans. 

""Sir, are you done?"" I move to turn the monitor back on ""I can shut it down and walk you to the exit""

""NO WAIT"" he reaches out to stop me.

I reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight. The windows file transfer dialog, with its loading bar, animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive. 

Hold on.....

300GB of files are being moved.....

from a folder labeled ""NOT PORN"".......

My discovery happens in an instant, and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again. 

""that is private, Students should not be rooting through professors files!""

""yes sir, my mistake"" I begin walking out "" Give me a call when your finished"". I round the corner and keep walking, I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away, I double over and laugh for a while. eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington, Lord of Not Pornia. 

""So what happens now?"" he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine. I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data. He demands that he wants to witness the wiping, ""for security reasons"". I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was 300GB of Not porn was...""For Science"". But he stood by for 40 minutes as killdisc did its magic. 

I escorted him out and he thanked me and my boss, promising to ""put in a good word for IT because of our good work here"".  As he left, I avoided shaking his hand. 

Edit: the're in there with their bear.

Amaltron,15,,6,1r5o8x,,53,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive!

FenrisFrost,13,,2,1r678j,,53,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*.""

Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,55,TalesFromTechsupport

rat_in_your_basement,27,,19,1rejzv,,46,"I'm my own stupid user in this story. This is from back when I still had a Win XP SP3 (on a 64-bit processor at that), and had zero IT experience. I'm hazy on the technical details, and have no clue how I got the virus in the first place, but here goes:

I started to run into this issue with my web browsers (except for Rockmelt, the virus wasn't compatible with Rockmelt), where clicking on links in a Google search window would cause me to be redirected to a very shady looking site full of even shadier advertisements. Like hell are there only fifteen local singles in my area. I had Malwarebytes, but after dozens of failed scans, I was able to conclude that whatever it was that made it onto my computer would cause a BSOD upon detection. Being inexperienced, I either had no clue about all of Malwarebytes' little tools to get around that, or they didn't exist back then.

One way or another, I decided to try my luck with encryption. Google (unbeknownst to most of the world) runs an [encrypted version of their search engine](https://encrypted.google.com), and I ended up relying heavily on it, as it seemed to get around the malicious software. 

A little while later, I installed [Windows Network Monitor](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=4865) and ran an unencrypted Google search. Upon doing the search, Network Monitor told me what file had accessed the internet and caused my redirect. Upon scanning it with MBAM, BSOD. No huge surprise. I considered simply deleting it, but Windows 7 had just come out, and that was just one of many issues that had accumulated on that machine over the years.

Agtsmth,21,,6,1r26se,,46,"Years ago I worked for a company we will call IQ on a contract for customer we will call CQP. We provided all hardware support from midrange down. You get the picture. 

We had a tech out at one of our customers ""bank branches"", this would upset the customer, the proper term is ""banking center"". Anyways, on to the story. The tech goes on site to replace a failed drive on the server. After the drive is replaced he calls to let the derp desk know and they see another drive degraded and want it replaced. Since the tech knows how RAID 5 works he tells them that this is a bad idea until the set rebuilds and engages our second level to CYA. Second level starts recording the phone call and sending out emails. After much documentation on this situation (and the derp desk refusing to listen) second level tells the tech to replace the drive. Que HARD ERROR in Windows 2K3 and the help desk's response is ""what happened?"". Both techs response was ""We told you so!"".

So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.

Kataclysm,28,,3,1r2eke,,41,"I work in IT. I've been involved professionally for going on seven years now, and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on 20. I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

""You will not modify my network.

""You will not install unauthorized software, override my firewall, or even insert a USB key drive into any computer in this network, or I will know about it. This network will notify me.

And I decided that one thing, aside from the computer maintenance and network operations and and and that comes with IT, one thing I decided I wanted to do was give that speech to the new hires some day.

I have modified my own, just in case I ever meet the day where I am allowed to give this speech.  I plan on threatening the theft of the soul of the policy violators through their pupils - in a way that is so painful, there will be no anesthetic that could ever hope to kill that pain.

I receive an email request with probably 7 people involved in the email chain. AD account with local server admin rights needed for an application install.

I go through the requisite steps of setting up the account, applying the expiration date, restricting the logon to that application server, adding admin rights on that application server.  Quick and easy!

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.

Until I receive yet another email.

Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

Thankfully the user that reported the issue was quick to give me the URL and screen shots of the issue. I do our standard troubleshooting and verify it's just not going to fix itself. 
I call up our clients help desk fight my way through their IVR which never works and one of their tier I techs. Once I give him my username for their systems and tell him the company I call from I tell him the site my agents are unable to sign into and ask if they are doing maintenance as it's late on Friday night. Now this guy is green as they come and isn't keeping up with what I'm saying. He spends more time going through his notes and asking his supervisor questions than talking to me. 

Now, I'd like to point out the error my agents are getting is a notauth.html is not found on the server. I need to repeat this several times and finally get his email so I can send him the screenshots and URL. At this point he tells me he can access the site and is claiming its an issue on my companies end. Well at this point I've been on the phone with him 30 minutes after I was supposed to be off for the night and have lost my patience for the week, and proceed to tell him this is not an issue on my end and it is their sever tossing the error preventing logins. He doesn't speak for another 5 minutes and finally gives me a ticket number and tells me he's sent it the application support team. At this point I've had a 45ish minute phone call that should have lasted about 10. I tell him thanks document our problem incident and inform my relief with the ticket info for the client and our problem number for tracking shoot out a page to all our centers as an FYI in case it's still down in the morning and run away. 

TL:DR- Clients Server error obviously means something in my companies network is blocking the traffic. ",Your Oracle issue is somehow my problem,28,TalesFromTechsupport
elpresidente072,8,,3,1r63k7,,21,"First a little background about my position:
I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.  I thank him for his assistance and hang up.

As I am typing it up, my ping falls back to &lt;30ms.  Coincidence?  I do not know.

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,32,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

*seriously? What do you people think I can do about this*

Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,22,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago. I notice he is using the ""Unread email"" view, so I switch to his Inbox and show him all his missing e-mails. ""But no!

I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders.

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
samurai-technician,4,,23,1r9aqc,,3,"Recent tales told here reminded me of this poignant vignette...


The winter of 1993 shimmers lithely in distant memory. My company was two groups: the artsy-fartsy liberals at the far end of the building deeply engrossed in their oh-so-important work for humanity and the technical group that made it all possible at the other end of the building.


The only technically competent individual in the artsy fartsy group was ironically the oldest, with one foot out the door and one deeply engrossed. His 'weltanschauung' was enlightening, he was always smiling--or perhaps smirking, and he drank coffee whose beans were roasted after they passed through a Lemur's ass. He was the only one of both ends of the building who had acquired a 9600 baud modem from the company at large. He knew how to work it too, boy. We didn't have to show him 'nuthin'. Our operations were on 1200 baud modems and less, and this guy gets to have his own 9600 baud modem.


He knew the AT command set and that commanded respect.


During the third shift, we, and when I say we, I mean mostly--if not only I would sit at his station--on his PC. We would dial in to the local BBS and...be part of the nascent internet. I would later have to defend my 'abuse' of the equipment and phone records of dialing into what was called...The Love Connection BBS? What I learned by doing this turned into knowledge to save the day that one time.


One day, during NBH, he reports to me a connectivity issue. He can dial up and connect, but cannot use Telix or Procomm to get any further. He demonstrates entirely from the various command lines. Probably something to do with that PPTP stuff. 


I call the local ISP...the only one channel in the galaxy...of cheap, reliable PINE and GOPHER play. He and I even had an email address from them--a real novelty. The kid at the help desk begins his script.


He had me go through all the standard stuff--turning this and that off, typing this and this command, even reloading DOS, and after about twenty minutes finally admits that they are experiencing problems and this is most likely related.

Techsupportvictim,241,,674,1r5j3f,,1700,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

FredFltStn,175,,408,1r22gy,,1193,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

Techsupportvictim,40,,190,1ral73,,839,"Gent comes in to our store a couple of weeks ago. Issue with his laptop. I don't actually recall what the issue was in the end but we needed to send it to our repair depot. At least three days out of his hands, as many as seven. 

He needed to back up his stuff cause apparently he never had in the almost year he had had it. So we had gotten him a hard drive, showed him out to set it up etc. 

Game plan, he goes home, backs it up and then drops it off and we send it out. With luck they don't have too many machines and it's back fast. 

Roll forward two weeks and he comes in to drop it out off morning. Saturday. To be shipped via a third party that doesn't pick up on Saturdays to go to a center that isn't open on Sundays anyway. 

I'm not the one doing the paperwork but I can hear the whole thing from my post.

Tech taking it in tells him that it will go out Monday with luck by delivered back on Wednesday, maybe Thursday. 

To wit the guy yells out him that he is leaving to go out of the country first thing Monday morning and must have his computer for the trip. Now remember this all started two weeks ago and we could have sent it out that day if he'd been backing it up like a good user (double since he uses this for business it seems) 

The tech explains to him that this is not a repair we can do in store because we don't have the proper tools and parts and they would take a week to arrive even if we could get them. And according to the notes he knew two weeks ago what needed to be done. All very calmly.

The guy yells for a manager and our lead tech comes over. Hears the whole convo, hears the guy ranting about 'what are you going to do about it'  and with a totally calm and straight face simply replies

The Director, a genius in her own mind but otherwise clueless, bought a laptop and I got it all set up. This was on a Friday. On Monday I was called into her office (she was generally irate, this day was no exception.)

Director: My laptop didn't have Internet at home, you didn't set it up properly!

Me: It works fine here so it should work fine at home, did you connect it to your Internet connection at home? 

Director: No, I don't have wireless internet at home, that's why I bought a wireless laptop, so I'd have Internet access everywhere!!!

Me: Um, ok, that's not really how wireless works. I can get you a cellular card but that will run you (at the time) about $100 a month to have internet anywhere.

Director: What good was it to but a wireless laptop when it doesn't work wirelessly?

Rhywden,119,,117,1r99ob,,625,"This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a medium-sized students' dormitory (~500 connected clients).

Physical layout consisted of 4 houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches, thus providing 100 Mbit connections. 

So, one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door: ""Internet is down!""

First thing to check: Local issue? Tried connecting to the router remotely - no dice. Not only is the ""Internet down"" but the whole network. Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking, also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked. Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than I'll ever learn.

However, he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error. Uplink - fine. No errors in the logs. Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active ones!
We tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything. TCPdump didn't show any incoming traffic on our network facing card.

Until, by pure chance (or maybe desperation?), we rebooted the switches. Because the network suddenly came to life again... and ground to a halt mere seconds later.

Okay, time for another reset, this time with TCPdump to watch what's happening. And that's when we saw it: A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros (yes, even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port) and just one single 0x0F somewhere. And it flooded the network for the short time it worked.

We then worked out what had obviously happened: Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they _appeared_ to still be working (I kid you not, if you didn't watch them closely you'd notice nothing - it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didn't change over time as it usually would in a live network).

The solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again. That way we discovered the culprit - who wasn't home at the time (of course). He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC (which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download) had bluescreened which obviously didn't agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could.",The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport

curried_avenger,49,,116,1rbq0v,,551,"Follow up story to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1rbh79/not_so_fine_print/)

As I said before, I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront, with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customers.

Now, like most service departments, the technicians don’t work weekends, but the retail department is open 7 days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up - no real issue, it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekends.

It was a busy Sunday, which was unusual for this particular store, and staff were handling customers.  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store - no big deal, it’s where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section, so the staff think nothing of it.  Nothing, until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock room.

Turns out, one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friend’s laptop, and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store) before their friend had class on Monday.  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for, within reason, it didn’t matter to management when the work was done.

He starts pulling on the door, which is locked by key-card access.  He then starts knocking.

The technician, a lovely lady in her mid-twenties, was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement.  Having seen this guy, she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the door’s window.

The man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperation.

“Is she fucking ignoring me?!”

The customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out.  I thank him and move over to stop this guy’s impatience from escalating.  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help with.

“You guys need to sort this out.  I’m here to pick up my wife’s laptop, and your staff are all ignoring me.  That one out back is on the fucking phone!  I’m parked in a loading zone and I can’t wait.”

I apologise and say I will get things moving.  I look up the guy’s job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier.  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary, his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next, from about ten days ago.  We only heard back from her on Wednesday, four days ago, to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered, installed and the system tested.

“I know that, but obviously I’m here now and I’m not leaving without it.”

Now, I have two options.  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with the other parts), or I could tell this guy that technicians don’t work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period, unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service (twice the regular hourly charge) for the entirety of the job (with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash, if she agrees to do it).

“This is bullshit - I can see her back there.  Right now, I am looking at her right now,” he said as he pointed at her.  “She was on the fucking phone.  You should prioritise your customers in the store, for fucks sale.  What kind of outfit is this?”

At this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole, and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants.  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today, and I explain why that was not going to happen:

* Technicians do not work on weekends;
* His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked;
* The girl in the back was not working today; and
* I could fast-track the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon, at no extra charge, if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machine.

This took the better part of fifteen minutes.  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday, having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit.  He leaves the store in a huff.  

Two minutes later, he returns.

Meltingteeth,132,,118,1rguyg,,572,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

dalgeek,55,,66,1rforv,,417,"In this age of high speed computing and security, keeping accurate time is a must.  Some people just depend on time.windows.com, some use Tier2 NTP sources on the Internet, while others go the extra mile and buy their own GPS-driven time-keeping appliance.  I mean, what could be more reliable than having a highly accurate time source right on your own low-latency network?

I get a call from a customer one morning ""All of the phone systems are down!  Call processing, call centers, everything!""  I VPN in and start checking alerts; all sorts of strange alerts, mostly regarding invalid security certificates, but also database replication errors.  I check the certificates and they're still valid.  Database replication won't rebuild no matter what I do.  Agents can't log in even with correct passwords.  As I check the system status the date scrolls by quickly and I do a double take: April 1992?

Everything is sync'ed to NTP so that's the first place I look.  Sure enough, the NTP appliance seems to think it is 1992.  Due to some obscure hardware failure, the appliance lost GPS lock and decided to pick an arbitrary date in 1992 as the current time.  It would have been better if the thing just stopped working completely instead of giving out false time.  I shut down the network port on the appliance and added its IP address to the core switch so that everything could get somewhat correct time.  The network and databases slowly came back to life as the time was fixed.

Pretty much everything that depended on SSL or Kerberos failed.  The certificates were invalid not because they had expired, but they were not yet active!  Some systems happily set their clock back to 1992 because the NTP server said so, while others said ""waaait a minute"" and ignored the obviously erroneous time; now those two systems can't talk to each other.

Gambatte,72,,83,1rduku,,376,"Before the beginning, there was nothingness - a void so complete that the passage of time - even the very concept of time itself - was meaningless. Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits (having brought them with it, because - as one would expect by it's very definition - the larder of the eternal void was quite empty), and generally just messed up the whole boundless void. With a sigh, entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruption.

*Shortly after that,* I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths (PFY) when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment. Being a simple job, I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said check.

He promptly returned bearing the bad news: the coolant levels were low, and would require replenishment.

Seeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs, of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously, I assembled the group and informed them of said task.

&gt; ME: Any questions?

&gt; PFY: This coolant... Is it hazardous? What PPE (personal protective equipment) should we be using?

*Oh ho,* I thought, *A learning opportunity.*

&gt; ME: Excellent question, PFY. I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop. From there, you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to. So your job is now...

&gt; PFY: ...to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we need?

&gt; ME: Well done. Once you've done that, gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin - I'll come up to make sure that you do it properly.

So the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described. I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details as:

&gt; **Specific personal protective equipment:**

&gt; *Respiratory:*

&gt; None required.

&gt; *Eyes:*

&gt; Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquid.

&gt; *Hands:*

&gt; Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplated.

&gt; *Other clothing and equipment:*

&gt; Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vapor.

and

&gt; Compound is known as ""the universal solvent"" and does dissolve, at least to some extent, most common materials. 

So after a considerable period of time (far longer than it should have taken, really, but not longer than I had expected), I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedure.

I arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields, rubber aprons, rubber boots, and rubber gloves. A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on, ready to engage should the first two be overcome.

*This seems a little excessive,* I thought. Aloud, I instructed them to begin.

As it turns out, the PFYs had broken the task up into groups. The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling. Of course, he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do so.

As the coolant began to pour into the system, a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding 'dihydrogen monoxide' actually was...

*****

**FALLOUT:**

The PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety, then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS database.

The devious PFY was promoted to 2IC a few months later, and is still one of the very best I've ever had.

curried_avenger,34,,50,1rbh79,,322,"I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store.  We specialised in Apple products, and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customers.

One day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working, as she “can’t check her email”.  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all, and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard, requiring the computer to be formally booked into our on-site service system to arrange for parts and service.  I informed her of our (labour) prices, explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed within.

Having agreed to that, I begin getting her details to be entered into our system.  She gives me her phone number, but when I ask for an address…

“You don’t need that, actually.”


Now, how she expects to know what I need I didn’t understand, and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront - particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed, so we can’t really take prior payment since we don’t know what the extent of the repairs will be.

“I don’t want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyers.”

I explain that our service centre’s database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department, and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there.  I also explain that without a billing address our check-in software will not process the repair.

She reluctantly agrees, and I print out the form for her to sign.  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand (despite having a pen in front of her anyway) and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request - the ones pertaining to contact details.  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to *this particular service job* and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entity.

I ask her what she is doing.  

“I don’t want to be harassed by telemarketers.”

I ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with (not that I can negotiate different terms, but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson).  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her *under this very contract* is to speak with her in respect to this repair job, and show her the wording that says just that.  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation, and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of terms.

“Just get it done”.

She slides the service agreement towards me, grabs her handbag and walks out.  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it, given that I have not yet signed off on it.  The computer is in limbo and I can’t do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed.  However, I do have her phone number.  

I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it, and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned.  As it was not currently working, it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up, unless she requests that we hold onto it.  Naturally, she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us.  I inform her that there is a storage fee of $10 per day until the service request is completed.

She starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that it’s grabbing the attention of our other customers, even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all day.

A few hours later she storms into the store, with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson - a 16 year old girl - about how we are extorting her.  I step in and apologise for making her come back, and get the new agreement printed out.  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her, staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement as-is or leave with her computer.

She then goes quiet, and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hit…and starts sobbing.  Sobbing, and reading the terms she had earlier deleted.  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something, especially as she cried over the contract, and continued to sob as she signed it.  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a word.

curried_avenger,14,,46,1rbmxm,,305,"Sometimes, you gotta feel bad for a guy.

This was a slow day in the computer shop, so it’s just me and the manager (Mick) in our small branch, on university campus.  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive.  I say it’s possible, but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and it’s likely to be expensive.

An hour later a guy that is *the* picture of middle-management rocks into our store, out of breath and sweaty, presenting a password protected/encrypted USB key.

“This is it.”

Mick and share a glance at each other.

“I’m the guy that called you earlier,” shouts the customer.  “You know, about the data on the drive?” he pleads.

Mick takes a look at the drive, and notes it’s a secure drive that encrypts the data on it.

“What happened?”, I ask.

Turns out that the customer’s boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information. The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive, not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties.  Because the customer was a contractor, he was liable to lose his job over this.

Mick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts.  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering, it would appear as gibberish since it was encrypted.

The customer’s nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you, takes the drive, and leaves.

A couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer - a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me.  He mentions the drive, and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractor’s sister.  This contractor’s laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmin’s friends *very* unhappy, and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case.  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing, and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect - which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most people.

Sysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive, having been told it contained information pertaining to the university’s staff and payroll (i.e. highly sensitive data), for a proto-system to undergo testing with.  While the actual project was real, the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss, Sysadmin’s friend, Greg.  Of course, this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractor’s work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met.  Greg couldn’t actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractor’s inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himself.

Greg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password, and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing.  A simple task, but important.

In spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat, since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone, and data redundancy was an obvious step.  At least, until the rest of the story:

The contractor, having forgotten the password, destroying the (supposedly) only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced.  When Greg found the drive a few days later (plugged into the contractor’s computer FFS), the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty.  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor, the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data.  Understandably, his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonesty.

lawtechie,21,,57,1r15nt,,295,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",352,TalesFromTechsupport

I get a ticket for a printer, it wouldn't print from anything but tray 1. Usually as we all know, simple fix. So I go all the way to site, adjust the tray settings, starts printing. 

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white.

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

Me: What's going on with the printer?

User: The Xerox isn't working 

Me: *approach the Xerox, print test pages*  It seems alright. What's the problem?

User: THE PRINTER OVER THERE! 

Me: **now wanting to kill her** You mean the HP printer? 

User: Xerox, same thing. 

Me: ...(thinking in my head) (...uhhh...no...no it's not)

squigglechicken,72,,51,1r2ucm,,283,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

**TL;DR** - Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from $40,000 in repairs.","Magnets, THAT'S how they work.",334,TalesFromTechsupport

SirEDCaLot,54,,42,1r4i39,,256,"This takes place several years ago.  I'd just been hired by a small independent IT firm.  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

-----

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:** This is EDC (first name), how can I help you?

**Caller:**  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot (first and last name) at $company?  (she knows my name and extension...)

**Me:**  Yes it is!  What can I do for you today?

**Caller:**  Well I'm having a problem with my Apple Silver computer it's probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card (impossible, my cards didn't exist yet) and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thing?

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

ilawlfase,55,,52,1rcyeh,,251,"Today I had a difficult call simply because of how not computer savvy my customer was.  Somehow, a tech came in, installed a new gateway...and didn't tell her the password, the name....and didn't even tell her she would have to connect to it.  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasn't working...and she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first place.

But that's not even the call I wanted to tell you about.  Today's call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company.  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up.  He'd never had it before, just a modem for his computer.  Now he has a small Mac laptop.  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didn't know much about Macs and until this job, probably wouldn't have.  But that's fine.  I told him where the network name was, and how to connect and how to input the password.  Then as I'm doing my ending and asking if there's anything else.  He asks me: ""So how far away can I use this?""


I was a little thrown off, but I figured he has a large house.  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extenders.

""No, I mean.  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat, will I still be able to use it?""
I'm absolutely stumped.  I knew he'd never had wireless in his home, but has he ever used it before in his life?  When I told him that it doesn't work that way, he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway.  So i told him he could always get a hotspot that he can get from his cellphone company....we don't offer those.  He asked me how much.  I didn't know, but estimated it might be around the cost of a cellphone bill.  He continues asking me what good is his wireless then.   I told him how it's used, and why it's great.  But it's not safe to drive down the road with your laptop anyway.  He eventually hung up, sounding more than a little annoyed that his router wasn't strong enough to reach him 50 miles away.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”

pyro-genesis,23,,31,1r1kgu,,233,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,47,,40,1r6dl6,,230,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home. 

As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didn't like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it. He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift. What was happening is that the film lost its ""stick"" after being pulled off an put back on day after day for a couple of weeks.

I wasn't going to deal with this after a 14 hour shift. I walked away quietly and talked to his boss the next day.

mdsnbelle,34,,31,1r8mwy,,207,"Backstory: I support a school system.

Our middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting.  The elementary schools don't. After a couple of cycles of trying to guess for the reporting, I finally convinced my boss to make this a full-on directive from the Superintendent.  It went out in August with reminders in September and October.

After several schools failed to comply, we identified our bad eggs, sent them to the head of the IT department, and he distributed them to the  schools that haven't complied.

That's when the excuses started.  Not from the principals, the secretaries who should have been doing this the entire time. They keep claiming they ""did it before,"" but the system deleted their records.  That's what they told their bosses, who are now telling their bosses, who is now telling my boss's boss that that's what happened.  Luckily, my boss and I know that that's 100% not possible. **The system does not magically delete data that wasn't there in the first place!**  I'm just pissed that the custom system I helped design (that I've now given 8 years of my life to) has this reputation of deleting data at will when it's the sheer fucking laziness of my users and their unwillingness to get caught not doing their jobs that is causing the downfall of its reputation.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just sick of giving up my nights and weekends, my holidays, and my sleep-time to a system to have its reputation thrown in the toilet by a bunch of unappreciative fuck-ups.

the_unusual_suspect,15,,23,1r9cpz,,178,"So this was maybe a year ago, but I just haven't sat down to right about it.

I used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits. They also resold T1 circuits, and things of that nature. On top of that, they also provided point-to-point wireless access, VOIP, webhosting, and e-mail.

Providing support for resold internet really isn't as bad as you think -- especially considering I was T2, and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center. Simple stuff. And VOIP never really caused any issues.

What did cause issues was e-mail. 

We actually hosted our own e-mail server. I couldn't tell you what we used off the top of my head right now, but it was linux based (all of our software was). And that's fine -- it was free and simple. Only... it wasn't updated regularly... or ever.

So eventually we arrive to the day in question. 

As you may have guessed, we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question. Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form, so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted. Well, we started receiving a series of... interesting emails. After a quick google search it turns out it's a very basic SQL injection used to, essentially, retrieve the password for an email account. Thing is if you grab the right one... say our network administrators email password, well... that's when the trouble can start (especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins). Or so I thought -- it's actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using. I'll get into that in a minute.

So, me and my co-worker inform our network admin. He takes a look, and bans the IP abusing the form. That was it. Fantastic. We have no idea whats been accessed. I inform everyone I can, and they assure me our network admin will take care of it. And that is that, as they say.

Well, not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam. Our internal email accounts, and our customer email accounts. It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs. I'm talking verizon, yahoo, charter -- it was just unbelievable. So as our network admin is ""looking for a solution"" me and my coworker investigate on our own.

Now, i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right. Well guess what? Email is hosted via that server as well. Which isn't that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHING.

So, how it works if you're unfamiliar is as follow.

SSH into our server (we allowed the access). And from there all you had to do was keep '..'ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts. Oh, and you didn't need a password to get into them. YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT. One other thing -- sudo commands freely fucking available. And there's our god damned problem.

So now we're a god damned ISP that, when I check, was responsible for .01% of the entire spam coming across the internet. That's a shit load.

Of course this was immediately brought up to our network admin, and the owner. I don't know how to emphasize absolute and total despair, but they DIDN'T FUCKING BELIEVE US. You know what they blamed it on? Spoofing. FUCKING SPOOFING. Sorry, it still infuriates me.

They tried implementing ""solutions"" but nothing really panned out -- which you know, is because someone had unfettered access to our shit. It was a constant fight until the day I quit. My coworker quit the same day. It was interesting.

ViolentLambs,40,,32,1r7gk3,,165,"I went to a vocational school for three years (10th-12th grade) and I took electronics and robotics. A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home. Installed windows seven and happily took the PC to its owner in computer office technology.

I don't know that client didn't notice or at least check for those roach things.. That was the first time I ever encountered something like that.

FenrisFrost,51,,22,1r7yh4,,153,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,150,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?!

PotatoRoll,60,,22,1r88u6,,137,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

I was still mad when I typed this, but I feel a lot better now.

Gambatte,29,,20,1r0tjr,,129,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

RoninSpartan,17,,32,1r251v,,115,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---
GOD_OF_IT = network admin

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

We are supposed to have that meeting shortly, this will definitely be a point that is brought up.

effingWitchDoctor,8,,21,1r8pky,,116,"Hi again, TFTS. 

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

tl;dr: a party of at least 6 is required to defeat a top-tier illiteratus and we were duoing, so we ran.

We do not have a lab for this for whatever reason so the students have to do testing on their personal laptops.

Java always needs to be the most current version, Flash needs to be current and Firefox seems to be the only browser we don't have issues with which isn't a huge deal, but not everyone keeps their PC or Mac up to date which causes problems.

A student raises her hand and I walk over to her. She is having an issue with her test. It appears to be a Java issue so the first thing I tell her to do is go to Java.com to see if she has the latest version. She does not so I have her download Java. She kept telling me ""it's not popping up to install"". I told her that she needed to check her downloads window in Firefox (which was popped up on the screen). She couldn't see the file clearly labeled so she proceeded to download it again and again and again..... So finally she listens to me, finds the download window and installs it. Cool, Java is up to date now so let's start the test. Re-open Firefox and go to the testing site. She instead opens Chrome and goes to the site.

I walk past his office the other day and his monitor is decidedly blue.  I stop, turn around, and ask him about it. He's got no idea, it just started happening that morning.  I ask him about the VGA cable from the monitor to his dock, he says he replugged it at both ends but it didn't help.  I'm busy and technically not IT anymore, so I shrug, tell him to try a reboot and if it doesn't work, call $DerpContractIT.  

He hollers at me the other a couple days ago (his office is 6' away from my cubicle) and I pop my head into his office.  Monitor is still blue, and he's got an Excel sheet open that's almost unreadable.  I futz with the settings on the OSD (with him helpfully chiming in that he can't mouse-click on the OSD - thanks, Captain Dumbass), but nothing makes a difference. I tell him to hang on while I find another monitor cable, and dig a DVI cable out of the server room.

I unplug the VGA cable and shove it through the desk grommet, plug in the DVI and push it through.  Go around and under the desk to feed it back up to the laptop dock and it's just a hair short. I get it through the grommet near the dock and go back topside.  

I need to move the dock to the right a couple inches, but there's nearly no slack in the cables.  I wrestle it over, but it's nearly touching his desk phone, so I try to move that over.  It moves maybe a half inch.

Back under the desk, the cables had been ""managed"" within an inch of their lives. The dude who did the cable management used short screws and the keyhole hangers on the surge protector to get it out of the way, then cheap, one-way zip ties on those self-adhesive loops to get the cables off the floor.  There's zero slack anywhere.  The zip-ties can't be cut with scissors, and I don't want to take a razor to them. The guy had apparently pulled the zip-ties too tight, as the loose DVI cable works fine.  

I shake my head, apologize for the interruption, and question the wisdom of using a dude who had never in his life done cable management to do cable management.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook, as I had a rather nice laptop that I'd gotten for graduation that I had, to quote, ""Done some cool crap with."" Well, she's my friend, and I like learning about computers, so I figured I could give it a shot.

Red pulls out her Notebook, turns it on, and logs on, before clicking Firefox to load up her internet. My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up. I'm doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this, and start asking the obvious questions. (To me anyway)

Me: ""Well, have you cleared out your cache recently? It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your system.""

Red: ""My what?""

Now I knew that there was a possibility I wasn't using the correct terms, as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family, and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me. Dad always called what I was thinking of ""The Cache"" and so I didn't know what else to call it.

Me: ""Errr, it's like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web. Some sites are especially bad for it, and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them. Cheezburger, for instance. There's a program you run to clean it out, let me see if you have on-""

Here Red's Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off. ""Oh no, there's a button on that fox browser thing that does that.""

I blinked, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was talking about the ""Data management"" window that you can bring up. I resisted face-palming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms, and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused. 

Me: ""Errr, no, I think that's the browser cache. I'm talking about a different one on the computer itself, sorry, I might not be using the proper terms.""

Granny: ""Well I don't think clearing the computer is necessary, the browser fixes that stuff, Red's probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all up.""

At this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch, and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace. As I struggle to get anything to load, Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down. As I searched for an anti-cirus, a cleaner, *anything*, I said it was a possibility, before giving up and asking her what anti-virus she had. She said she didn't know what I meant.

Me: Like, uh, Norton, or McAfee? 

Red: Oh. No I ain't got that. Why?

Me: Well, I think you might have a virus. They're really easy for your computer to pick up if you don't have a proper anti-virus. It's probably what's gumming up your system.

Red: Ohhh. What are you doing?

I was, at that very second, looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned, with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton. I explained as such, and Red told me bluntly not to. I looked at her with a look of uttermost

Me: Wut.

Red: I downloaded somethin' like that a little while ago and it just made things worse. So don't.

I figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones, and tried to explain that. I think I lost her in the second sentence, so I gave up and just said that it wasn't a ""Proper"" anti-virus, but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people. She still wouldn't let me download it. As she took her Notebook back, with me conceding defeat, I suggested that, if she didn't want to download the free one, she could always go to Staples and buy Norton. I added that it was what I had, and would clean, repair, and kill all the virus, and it was very simple to use. It was mega-on-sale at the moment, and wouldn't be a bad idea. She told me she'd think about it, but it was a lot of money.

About a week later my sister (Black) and I seen Red with a brand new laptop. I asked her what happened with her Notebook, and she said that since it was so slow, she'd just gone and bought a new one. I blinked. 

Me: So it wasn't a virus? Cleaning it didn't help? Well that su-

Red: Oh no I didn't clean it or nuthin', I just chucked it and bought a new one instead.

Me: Wut. 

Black: Please tell me you didn't throw that Notebook in the trash.

Red: Nah, it's too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash. My friend actually wanted it, if you can believe it. So I let her have it.

Me: D-did you at least get Norton for your new computer? Like, does your new laptop have some sort of an anti-virus?

Red: Nah, it doesn't need that junk. It's all fast and new, I'm not gonna have any problems with this baby at all.

Black: You are going to become this store's best buckin' friend, ain't'cha, Ahou?



TL;DR  Friend buys new laptop for over $900 rather than spending 50 on an antivirus.

IsilZha,29,,20,1rghh8,,96,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport

Me: *** Servicedesk, this is dreadpirate15. 

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

We were immediately rewarded with the sound of an old register coming to a wheezy sort of life.

lawtechie,24,,24,1r39ta,,92,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away.

Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,35,,8,1r518r,,86,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Gambatte,14,,11,1r406j,,86,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

I work at the IT department of a pretty big University, and despite being a SysAd, sometimes I have to field calls, as we have no regular helpdesk.

One day a woman calls in, she says she needs help because she ""can't receive e-mails"" for several days now. I ask her the usual questions to help me understand her setup (is she using our Web Mail or Thunderbird, etc), but either she doesn't understand at all what I'm talking about, or she is being difficult on purpose.

After some time, I give up asking questions, and direct her to access the Web frontend, and login.

Upon loading up the Web Mail on her browser, she gets excited and  says ""Aha! Yes, yes, I can't receive my mail from here.""

A woman calls up and needs some remote troubleshooting done, she says her screen has gone blank. It's determined that the monitor has died after being left on 24-7 for 5 years or so, and a new one gets sent out. 

The woman is concerned about hooking it up herself. My co-worker explains to her what a VGA cable is, and that it's a big blue box and all she has to do is plug the new one into the wall with one cable and attach the new cord with the blue box on the computer.

FenrisFrost,8,,11,1r5ce7,,75,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves.

squigglechicken,5,,14,1r2dr9,,68,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

lawtechie,17,,8,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,8,1rg6w8,,67,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

So I haul the cart back downstairs to our storage area, and go back to my lunch which he so rudely interrupted.  

We receive the ticket again at 1:56pm EST changing it from 130 Series 1 tapes to 200 Series 2 tapes.  32 tapes are ejected (after telling OverseasGuy we can do 39 at a time...that's how much the door holds...for some reason this library has issues setting up a queue like the other machines, so they have to do it one door at a time).  I close the door waiting for the next set....nothing.  Multiple attempts to contact OverseasGuy were made with no response.

Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.


""What do you prefer,"" he asks me, ""a rack-mount server or a tower server?""


This is not going to go well. ""Why don't you ask the customer what they prefer?""


""That's a good idea."" He's been a salesman with the company for the past 9 years.


Moron orders an analog recording card from the manufacturer. I gazed alternatively at the packing slip and the contents of the box, back and forth with mouth agape in disbelief.


""Moron! You ordered an analog card and analog licenses. We don't use cards for VoIP."" I figuratively exclaimed.


""You told me this is what we need for a rack server tower,"" he literally stated.


(You know the cartoons where the character shakes his head so quickly from side to side and that blubbering sound spreads saliva all over the room...) I glowered at him. I took an intimidating battle stance. I stared at him. I locked eyes. The extended silence had no affect on his disposition. His eyes were dead.


""Did you order a rack or a tower?""


""I'm not going to order the server until the week of the install so we can maximize utilizing the warranty."" He talks like a brochure when he knows he's in trouble. Since, even when he eats lunch he's in over his head, he talks like a moron all the time.


""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in.

Nothing hugely special, I don't work in tech support, just a 20 year old travelling and currently living in France sharing an apartment with a French woman.

I discovered we share a similar taste in music and she often asked to use my computer to play music when I wasn't using it until I decided to put it on her Freebox hard drive (I think customers of the Free service here get a hard drive attached to/as part of their router, not sure really) which is accessible when connected to her wifi network.

Easy. Later that night I showed her where it was, what I'd put there, she was happy, excited almost, and we left it there.

Today I got home and she's playing around on her computer. I sit down and she says (in French, she speaks no English and I speak a little French) she can't open the music. First thought is I may have only created shortcuts somehow and now my computer is off the network so she can't access it. Before I grab my computer I ask her to show me what's happening. She pulls up windows explorer (whatever Windows equivalent of Finder is, I'm an OS X person, so sue me), navigates to the Freebox drive, double clicks ""disque dur"" and then clicks ""musique"". I wait for the second click to come and she looks over and says ""look! It doesn't open!""

smokeybehr,19,,8,1r2cf4,,58,"Inspired by /u/FredFltStn and his tales of printer woes.

I get a panicked call from one of the branches that a printer has been printing out multiples of the same document over and over until the printer is shut off, and when the printer is turned back on, it keeps printing. I tell them to leave the printer off, and that I'd be right out. 

When I get there, I hear the tales of woe from the staff, and go about checking everything. I check the workstation, the print server, the release station, and ask the staff if the customer had wanted more than one copy. Nothing indicated anything out of the ordinary. 

I turned the printer on, and it proceeded to start spitting out multiple copies of the document that had been printing previously. I mashed the heck out of the Cancel Job button to stop it. I test printed a document from one of the staff computers, and the same thing happened. 

I went back to the printer and began flipping through the menus, and there it was.

""Copies: 65534"" 

Apparently, one of the youthful customers (to put it politely) had been messing around with the printer settings, and had set the printer to this ungodly copy count. I reset the copy count back to 1, and tested again with success.

One day I'm chilling in shop messing around with our little Lego NXT robot and Z walks in. I graduated with her and she was a weird and crazy one but she comes in, calls me over, and asks for a repair form. I hand her one, fills it out real quick, and I ask her what problems she's having. 

After a short discussion she tells me that its incredibly slow and she thinks it has a virus. I tell her I get started on it and check back tomorrow. I put it on my bench hook up its charger power dat dell on and waited what felt like ten minutes. I get to the logon and she didn't give me her password. I thought well since she's Gone and I can't leave shop I think its time I pull out the ol paragon rescue kit. This is the best software I have ever used at gaining access to files and computers clients forgot to give me passwords for. I kept in my instructors office because in the wrong hands you could do some real evil with that disc because you boot it like an os install disc. It scans the hard drive and wipes ALL the passwords giving me administrator access to what ever I please. Fast forward about 20min and I'm in, get to her desktop and the horror.. This could turn into tech support gore.. You know those ads that can Change your mouse cursor, basically anything you should never click. She had no anti-virus witch doesn't surprise me. I click internet explorer and it stops responding. Okay I'll try chrome.. It stops responding too.. Okay I'll use task manager, go to their processes and kill the process tree. Task manager froze too.. Alright I'll reboot into safe mode with networking and download the free trial version of AVG. It downloads fast in safe mode installs and then I reboot. Run avg and it said it found over 1000 infected files! I let it do its thing but it took so long that i had to wait till the next day to finish up.

I come into shop. Fast forward last theory and im in lab. I check her laptop and not only did avg remove all the viruses it made it more faster and tolerable to use. I open internet explorer and no waiting its fast and responds like its supposed to. I open task manager and it doesn't freeze or crash. I opened chrome and it ran great i decided to download a random wallpaper to replace the black one the viruses put. Dragged it to the desktop. Changed the wallpaper and dragged it to the recycle bin but I accidentally dragged a photo that wasnt what I used there so i open up recycle bin and..

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up. 

After that several more times she would bring it back with the same problem only different exuses and sometimes she wouldn't even speak and i kept her privacy but it got to the point where avg no longer could do it job and I had to format and reinstall windows. Months later she donated it to the shop but never said why. Now that I think about it it had some kind of smeared residue near the track pad..

I work grunt level support for the uni I attend. Mostly my duties include answering phones, fixing people's moble wireless settings, and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support.  However, during the summers, some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers. New purchases are imaged, added to a domain, and have special software deployed based on where its going. Old relics leaving service  are KillDisc-ed, scavenged for parts, and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling. Its not a bad gig.


In order to maintain some degree of CYA, when computers arrive to be out-processed and recycled we keep them for 15 days before wiping them. This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine, it can still be recovered. Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience. 

Too bad that ""Most of the time"" is not "" All of the time""

This particular incident began with me arriving, caffeine in thermos, book in hand, for another day of processing. I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen, noting the paperwork. According to the paperwork, I can wipe it.  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights. ( I used to sing Daisy, Daisy while i worked, but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath, I laughed and said "" no im just grunt support"" )

I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed ""Professor. Derpingtons"" computer yet. I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me. Then, as if it were fate, I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on, lo and behold its Derpington's. 

""Not boss, I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press go""

""Well the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so don't kill it yet""

""Ok, should I get his files off for him?""

""No he says he needs them ASAP, Hes coming here to get them""

I double take, Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility. Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map.  The idea of a Bambi-eyed professor navigating our wire strewn, technological reliquary of a faculty is novel, if not terrifying. 

Soon the professor arrives, luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before. I walk him through several rooms, each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation. I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him. He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files. 

I step away for while, I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files. So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves. The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime, based on the volume of the fans. 

""Sir, are you done?"" I move to turn the monitor back on ""I can shut it down and walk you to the exit""

""NO WAIT"" he reaches out to stop me.

I reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight. The windows file transfer dialog, with its loading bar, animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive. 

Hold on.....

300GB of files are being moved.....

from a folder labeled ""NOT PORN"".......

My discovery happens in an instant, and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again. 

""that is private, Students should not be rooting through professors files!""

""yes sir, my mistake"" I begin walking out "" Give me a call when your finished"". I round the corner and keep walking, I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away, I double over and laugh for a while. eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington, Lord of Not Pornia. 

""So what happens now?"" he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine. I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data. He demands that he wants to witness the wiping, ""for security reasons"". I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was 300GB of Not porn was...""For Science"". But he stood by for 40 minutes as killdisc did its magic. 

I escorted him out and he thanked me and my boss, promising to ""put in a good word for IT because of our good work here"".  As he left, I avoided shaking his hand. 

Edit: the're in there with their bear.

Amaltron,15,,6,1r5o8x,,53,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive!

FenrisFrost,13,,2,1r678j,,53,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*.""

frozenfoxy,1,,7,1r1o5q,,48,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,55,TalesFromTechsupport

rat_in_your_basement,27,,19,1rejzv,,46,"I'm my own stupid user in this story. This is from back when I still had a Win XP SP3 (on a 64-bit processor at that), and had zero IT experience. I'm hazy on the technical details, and have no clue how I got the virus in the first place, but here goes:

I started to run into this issue with my web browsers (except for Rockmelt, the virus wasn't compatible with Rockmelt), where clicking on links in a Google search window would cause me to be redirected to a very shady looking site full of even shadier advertisements. Like hell are there only fifteen local singles in my area. I had Malwarebytes, but after dozens of failed scans, I was able to conclude that whatever it was that made it onto my computer would cause a BSOD upon detection. Being inexperienced, I either had no clue about all of Malwarebytes' little tools to get around that, or they didn't exist back then.

One way or another, I decided to try my luck with encryption. Google (unbeknownst to most of the world) runs an [encrypted version of their search engine](https://encrypted.google.com), and I ended up relying heavily on it, as it seemed to get around the malicious software. 

A little while later, I installed [Windows Network Monitor](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=4865) and ran an unencrypted Google search. Upon doing the search, Network Monitor told me what file had accessed the internet and caused my redirect. Upon scanning it with MBAM, BSOD. No huge surprise. I considered simply deleting it, but Windows 7 had just come out, and that was just one of many issues that had accumulated on that machine over the years.

So I did what any sane man would do: got a copy of Windows 7, and formatted the crap out of my hard-drive. No more virus, no more problem.",User VS Virus,65,TalesFromTechsupport

The tech goes on site to replace a failed drive on the server. After the drive is replaced he calls to let the derp desk know and they see another drive degraded and want it replaced. Since the tech knows how RAID 5 works he tells them that this is a bad idea until the set rebuilds and engages our second level to CYA. Second level starts recording the phone call and sending out emails. After much documentation on this situation (and the derp desk refusing to listen) second level tells the tech to replace the drive.

Kataclysm,28,,3,1r2eke,,41,"I work in IT. I've been involved professionally for going on seven years now, and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on 20. I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

ay_gov,2,,4,1r5zu4,,29,"Two instances of people who should know better not knowing better...  To be fair they are contractors so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.


**Instance the First**

I receive an email request with probably 7 people involved in the email chain. AD account with local server admin rights needed for an application install.

I go through the requisite steps of setting up the account, applying the expiration date, restricting the logon to that application server, adding admin rights on that application server.  Quick and easy!

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.  Well, the person he has cc'd is tech illiterate (read: my OS is Internet Explorer) so I'm not that fussed.  Return to my coffee and indulge in some Reddit....

Until I receive yet another email.  This time it's the project coordinator from the company replying to everyone in the email chain.... with the email I sent to the tech with his account details as an attachment.  Holy hell , Batman!  Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

The fail became to strong for my co-worker and he is currently off getting some air or possibly murdering people.

I work at a computer repair shop and a few days ago a customer came in saying that her laptop didn't connect to the internet. After careful examining I quickly concluded that there was something wrong with the Wifi card or it's drivers. After some more testing we easily concluded that it was a faulty wifi card and needed replacement. We phone the customer and she said to go ahead and we replaced the wifi card.

Shit's all fine and dandy the computer now connects to our wifi network with no issue and she leaves with it happy as a whistle.

**Then** a few days later she comes back saying that it can't connect to the internet anymore. So here I go again, I try to check the list of wifi networks in range, connect to our network and it connects just fine and goes onto the internet just fine.

It was a decently slow friday night and was just about to end my shift and was updating my overnight replacement about an issue that might come back up for one of our clients and telling them if one of our clients main application links stops working where the secondary URL is for a work around. 
I get a call 2 minutes before I'm due off where our only 24/7 center reports they cannot access one of our clients training sites. Thankfully the user that reported the issue was quick to give me the URL and screen shots of the issue. I do our standard troubleshooting and verify it's just not going to fix itself. 
I call up our clients help desk fight my way through their IVR which never works and one of their tier I techs. Once I give him my username for their systems and tell him the company I call from I tell him the site my agents are unable to sign into and ask if they are doing maintenance as it's late on Friday night. Now this guy is green as they come and isn't keeping up with what I'm saying. He spends more time going through his notes and asking his supervisor questions than talking to me. 

Now, I'd like to point out the error my agents are getting is a notauth.html is not found on the server. I need to repeat this several times and finally get his email so I can send him the screenshots and URL. At this point he tells me he can access the site and is claiming its an issue on my companies end. Well at this point I've been on the phone with him 30 minutes after I was supposed to be off for the night and have lost my patience for the week, and proceed to tell him this is not an issue on my end and it is their sever tossing the error preventing logins. He doesn't speak for another 5 minutes and finally gives me a ticket number and tells me he's sent it the application support team. At this point I've had a 45ish minute phone call that should have lasted about 10. I tell him thanks document our problem incident and inform my relief with the ticket info for the client and our problem number for tracking shoot out a page to all our centers as an FYI in case it's still down in the morning and run away.

elpresidente072,8,,3,1r63k7,,21,"First a little background about my position:
I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.  I thank him for his assistance and hang up.

As I am typing it up, my ping falls back to &lt;30ms.  Coincidence?  I do not know.

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,32,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons).

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

samurai-technician,4,,23,1r9aqc,,3,"Recent tales told here reminded me of this poignant vignette...


The winter of 1993 shimmers lithely in distant memory. My company was two groups: the artsy-fartsy liberals at the far end of the building deeply engrossed in their oh-so-important work for humanity and the technical group that made it all possible at the other end of the building.


The only technically competent individual in the artsy fartsy group was ironically the oldest, with one foot out the door and one deeply engrossed. His 'weltanschauung' was enlightening, he was always smiling--or perhaps smirking, and he drank coffee whose beans were roasted after they passed through a Lemur's ass. He was the only one of both ends of the building who had acquired a 9600 baud modem from the company at large. He knew how to work it too, boy. We didn't have to show him 'nuthin'. Our operations were on 1200 baud modems and less, and this guy gets to have his own 9600 baud modem.


He knew the AT command set and that commanded respect.


During the third shift, we, and when I say we, I mean mostly--if not only I would sit at his station--on his PC. We would dial in to the local BBS and...be part of the nascent internet. I would later have to defend my 'abuse' of the equipment and phone records of dialing into what was called...The Love Connection BBS? What I learned by doing this turned into knowledge to save the day that one time.


One day, during NBH, he reports to me a connectivity issue. He can dial up and connect, but cannot use Telix or Procomm to get any further. He demonstrates entirely from the various command lines. Probably something to do with that PPTP stuff. 


I call the local ISP...the only one channel in the galaxy...of cheap, reliable PINE and GOPHER play. He and I even had an email address from them--a real novelty. The kid at the help desk begins his script.


He had me go through all the standard stuff--turning this and that off, typing this and this command, even reloading DOS, and after about twenty minutes finally admits that they are experiencing problems and this is most likely related.

Techsupportvictim,241,,674,1r5j3f,,1700,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

FredFltStn,175,,408,1r22gy,,1193,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

Two weeks later he brings it back because it wouldn't boot. After some poking around, I noticed that the Software and System registry hives were empty, and looking on disk, the files that held them were only 256kB in size, but apparently the real hives were still there, just renamed to have .iobit extension (WTF?).

Since the same thing happened after several reboots, I went into Safe Mode and looked at Programs and Features: 3 Start Menu replacements (one we provided, two installed later), 5 different optimizers, several Registry cleaners, countless toolbars. As there were other problems (registry permissions were screwed up so badly that you couldn't change view modes in Explorer), I simply reinstalled Windows (and upgraded to 8.1, which came out that day).

Techsupportvictim,40,,190,1ral73,,839,"Gent comes in to our store a couple of weeks ago. Issue with his laptop. I don't actually recall what the issue was in the end but we needed to send it to our repair depot. At least three days out of his hands, as many as seven. 

He needed to back up his stuff cause apparently he never had in the almost year he had had it. So we had gotten him a hard drive, showed him out to set it up etc. 

Game plan, he goes home, backs it up and then drops it off and we send it out. With luck they don't have too many machines and it's back fast. 

Roll forward two weeks and he comes in to drop it out off morning. Saturday. To be shipped via a third party that doesn't pick up on Saturdays to go to a center that isn't open on Sundays anyway. 

I'm not the one doing the paperwork but I can hear the whole thing from my post.

Tech taking it in tells him that it will go out Monday with luck by delivered back on Wednesday, maybe Thursday. 

To wit the guy yells out him that he is leaving to go out of the country first thing Monday morning and must have his computer for the trip. Now remember this all started two weeks ago and we could have sent it out that day if he'd been backing it up like a good user (double since he uses this for business it seems) 

The tech explains to him that this is not a repair we can do in store because we don't have the proper tools and parts and they would take a week to arrive even if we could get them. And according to the notes he knew two weeks ago what needed to be done. All very calmly.

Rhywden,119,,117,1r99ob,,625,"This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a medium-sized students' dormitory (~500 connected clients).

Physical layout consisted of 4 houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches, thus providing 100 Mbit connections. 

So, one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door: ""Internet is down!""

First thing to check: Local issue? Tried connecting to the router remotely - no dice. Not only is the ""Internet down"" but the whole network. Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking, also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked. Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than I'll ever learn.

However, he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error. Uplink - fine. No errors in the logs. Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active ones!
We tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything. TCPdump didn't show any incoming traffic on our network facing card.

Until, by pure chance (or maybe desperation?), we rebooted the switches. Because the network suddenly came to life again... and ground to a halt mere seconds later.

Okay, time for another reset, this time with TCPdump to watch what's happening. And that's when we saw it: A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros (yes, even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port) and just one single 0x0F somewhere. And it flooded the network for the short time it worked.

We then worked out what had obviously happened: Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they _appeared_ to still be working (I kid you not, if you didn't watch them closely you'd notice nothing - it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didn't change over time as it usually would in a live network).

The solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again. That way we discovered the culprit - who wasn't home at the time (of course). He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC (which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download) had bluescreened which obviously didn't agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could.",The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport

curried_avenger,49,,116,1rbq0v,,551,"Follow up story to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1rbh79/not_so_fine_print/)

As I said before, I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront, with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customers.

Now, like most service departments, the technicians don’t work weekends, but the retail department is open 7 days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up - no real issue, it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekends.

It was a busy Sunday, which was unusual for this particular store, and staff were handling customers.  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store - no big deal, it’s where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section, so the staff think nothing of it.  Nothing, until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock room.

Turns out, one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friend’s laptop, and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store) before their friend had class on Monday.  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for, within reason, it didn’t matter to management when the work was done.

He starts pulling on the door, which is locked by key-card access.  He then starts knocking.

The technician, a lovely lady in her mid-twenties, was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement.  Having seen this guy, she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the door’s window.

The man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperation.

“Is she fucking ignoring me?!”

The customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out.  I thank him and move over to stop this guy’s impatience from escalating.  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help with.

“You guys need to sort this out.  I’m here to pick up my wife’s laptop, and your staff are all ignoring me.  That one out back is on the fucking phone!  I’m parked in a loading zone and I can’t wait.”

I apologise and say I will get things moving.  I look up the guy’s job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier.  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary, his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next, from about ten days ago.  We only heard back from her on Wednesday, four days ago, to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered, installed and the system tested.

“I know that, but obviously I’m here now and I’m not leaving without it.”

Now, I have two options.  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with the other parts), or I could tell this guy that technicians don’t work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period, unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service (twice the regular hourly charge) for the entirety of the job (with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash, if she agrees to do it).

“This is bullshit - I can see her back there.  Right now, I am looking at her right now,” he said as he pointed at her.  “She was on the fucking phone.  You should prioritise your customers in the store, for fucks sale.  What kind of outfit is this?”

At this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole, and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants.  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today, and I explain why that was not going to happen:

* Technicians do not work on weekends;
* His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked;
* The girl in the back was not working today; and
* I could fast-track the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon, at no extra charge, if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machine.

This took the better part of fifteen minutes.  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday, having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit.  He leaves the store in a huff.  

Two minutes later, he returns.

Meltingteeth,132,,118,1rguyg,,572,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

dalgeek,55,,66,1rforv,,417,"In this age of high speed computing and security, keeping accurate time is a must.  Some people just depend on time.windows.com, some use Tier2 NTP sources on the Internet, while others go the extra mile and buy their own GPS-driven time-keeping appliance.  I mean, what could be more reliable than having a highly accurate time source right on your own low-latency network?

I get a call from a customer one morning ""All of the phone systems are down!  Call processing, call centers, everything!""

I check the certificates and they're still valid.  Database replication won't rebuild no matter what I do.  Agents can't log in even with correct passwords.  As I check the system status the date scrolls by quickly and I do a double take: April 1992?

Everything is sync'ed to NTP so that's the first place I look.  Sure enough, the NTP appliance seems to think it is 1992.  Due to some obscure hardware failure, the appliance lost GPS lock and decided to pick an arbitrary date in 1992 as the current time.  It would have been better if the thing just stopped working completely instead of giving out false time.  I shut down the network port on the appliance and added its IP address to the core switch so that everything could get somewhat correct time.  The network and databases slowly came back to life as the time was fixed.

Pretty much everything that depended on SSL or Kerberos failed.  The certificates were invalid not because they had expired, but they were not yet active!  Some systems happily set their clock back to 1992 because the NTP server said so, while others said ""waaait a minute"" and ignored the obviously erroneous time; now those two systems can't talk to each other.

Gambatte,72,,83,1rduku,,376,"Before the beginning, there was nothingness - a void so complete that the passage of time - even the very concept of time itself - was meaningless. Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits (having brought them with it, because - as one would expect by it's very definition - the larder of the eternal void was quite empty), and generally just messed up the whole boundless void. With a sigh, entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruption.

*Shortly after that,* I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths (PFY) when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment. Being a simple job, I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said check.

He promptly returned bearing the bad news: the coolant levels were low, and would require replenishment.

Seeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs, of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously, I assembled the group and informed them of said task.

&gt; ME: Any questions?

&gt; PFY: This coolant... Is it hazardous? What PPE (personal protective equipment) should we be using?

*Oh ho,* I thought, *A learning opportunity.*

&gt; ME: Excellent question, PFY. I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop. From there, you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to. So your job is now...

&gt; PFY: ...to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we need?

&gt; ME: Well done. Once you've done that, gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin - I'll come up to make sure that you do it properly.

So the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described. I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details as:

&gt; **Specific personal protective equipment:**

&gt; *Respiratory:*

&gt; None required.

&gt; *Eyes:*

&gt; Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquid.

&gt; *Hands:*

&gt; Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplated.

&gt; *Other clothing and equipment:*

&gt; Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vapor.

and

&gt; Compound is known as ""the universal solvent"" and does dissolve, at least to some extent, most common materials. 

So after a considerable period of time (far longer than it should have taken, really, but not longer than I had expected), I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedure.

I arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields, rubber aprons, rubber boots, and rubber gloves. A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on, ready to engage should the first two be overcome.

*This seems a little excessive,* I thought. Aloud, I instructed them to begin.

As it turns out, the PFYs had broken the task up into groups. The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling. Of course, he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do so.

As the coolant began to pour into the system, a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding 'dihydrogen monoxide' actually was...

*****

**FALLOUT:**

The PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety, then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS database.

The devious PFY was promoted to 2IC a few months later, and is still one of the very best I've ever had.

One day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working, as she “can’t check her email”.  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all, and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard, requiring the computer to be formally booked into our on-site service system to arrange for parts and service.  I informed her of our (labour) prices, explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed within.

Having agreed to that, I begin getting her details to be entered into our system.  She gives me her phone number, but when I ask for an address…

Now, how she expects to know what I need I didn’t understand, and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront - particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed, so we can’t really take prior payment since we don’t know what the extent of the repairs will be.

I explain that our service centre’s database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department, and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there.  I also explain that without a billing address our check-in software will not process the repair.

She reluctantly agrees, and I print out the form for her to sign.  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand (despite having a pen in front of her anyway) and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request - the ones pertaining to contact details.  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to *this particular service job* and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entity.

I ask her what she is doing.  

“I don’t want to be harassed by telemarketers.”

I ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with (not that I can negotiate different terms, but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson).  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her *under this very contract* is to speak with her in respect to this repair job, and show her the wording that says just that.  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation, and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of terms.

“Just get it done”.

She slides the service agreement towards me, grabs her handbag and walks out.  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it, given that I have not yet signed off on it.  The computer is in limbo and I can’t do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed.  However, I do have her phone number.  

I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it, and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned.  As it was not currently working, it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up, unless she requests that we hold onto it.  Naturally, she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us.  I inform her that there is a storage fee of $10 per day until the service request is completed.

She starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that it’s grabbing the attention of our other customers, even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all day.

A few hours later she storms into the store, with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson - a 16 year old girl - about how we are extorting her.  I step in and apologise for making her come back, and get the new agreement printed out.  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her, staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement as-is or leave with her computer.

She then goes quiet, and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hit…and starts sobbing.  Sobbing, and reading the terms she had earlier deleted.  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something, especially as she cried over the contract, and continued to sob as she signed it.  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a word.

Her husband was an asshole, too, but that’s a story for later.",Not so fine print,372,TalesFromTechsupport
curried_avenger,14,,46,1rbmxm,,305,"Sometimes, you gotta feel bad for a guy.

This was a slow day in the computer shop, so it’s just me and the manager (Mick) in our small branch, on university campus.  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive.  I say it’s possible, but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and it’s likely to be expensive.

An hour later a guy that is *the* picture of middle-management rocks into our store, out of breath and sweaty, presenting a password protected/encrypted USB key.

“This is it.”

Mick and share a glance at each other.

“I’m the guy that called you earlier,” shouts the customer.  “You know, about the data on the drive?” he pleads.

Mick takes a look at the drive, and notes it’s a secure drive that encrypts the data on it.

“What happened?”, I ask.

Turns out that the customer’s boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information. The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive, not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties.  Because the customer was a contractor, he was liable to lose his job over this.

Mick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts.  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering, it would appear as gibberish since it was encrypted.

The customer’s nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you, takes the drive, and leaves.

A couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer - a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me.  He mentions the drive, and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractor’s sister.  This contractor’s laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmin’s friends *very* unhappy, and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case.  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing, and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect - which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most people.

Sysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive, having been told it contained information pertaining to the university’s staff and payroll (i.e. highly sensitive data), for a proto-system to undergo testing with.  While the actual project was real, the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss, Sysadmin’s friend, Greg.  Of course, this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractor’s work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met.  Greg couldn’t actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractor’s inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himself.

Greg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password, and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing.  A simple task, but important.

In spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat, since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone, and data redundancy was an obvious step.  At least, until the rest of the story:

The contractor, having forgotten the password, destroying the (supposedly) only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced.  When Greg found the drive a few days later (plugged into the contractor’s computer FFS), the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty.  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor, the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data.  Understandably, his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonesty.

At this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughter.

lawtechie,21,,57,1r15nt,,295,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",352,TalesFromTechsupport

squigglechicken,72,,51,1r2ucm,,283,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

**TL;DR** - Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from $40,000 in repairs.","Magnets, THAT'S how they work.",334,TalesFromTechsupport

SirEDCaLot,54,,42,1r4i39,,256,"This takes place several years ago.  I'd just been hired by a small independent IT firm.  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

-----

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:** This is EDC (first name), how can I help you?

**Caller:**  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot (first and last name) at $company?  (she knows my name and extension...)

**Me:**  Yes it is!  What can I do for you today?

**Caller:**  Well I'm having a problem with my Apple Silver computer it's probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card (impossible, my cards didn't exist yet) and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thing?

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

Somehow, a tech came in, installed a new gateway...and didn't tell her the password, the name....and didn't even tell her she would have to connect to it.  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasn't working...and she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first place.

But that's not even the call I wanted to tell you about.  Today's call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company.  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up.  He'd never had it before, just a modem for his computer.  Now he has a small Mac laptop.  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didn't know much about Macs and until this job, probably wouldn't have.  But that's fine.  I told him where the network name was, and how to connect and how to input the password.  Then as I'm doing my ending and asking if there's anything else.  He asks me: ""So how far away can I use this?""


I was a little thrown off, but I figured he has a large house.  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extenders.

""No, I mean.  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat, will I still be able to use it?""
I'm absolutely stumped.  I knew he'd never had wireless in his home, but has he ever used it before in his life?  When I told him that it doesn't work that way, he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway.  So i told him he could always get a hotspot that he can get from his cellphone company....we don't offer those.  He asked me how much.  I didn't know, but estimated it might be around the cost of a cellphone bill.  He continues asking me what good is his wireless then.   I told him how it's used, and why it's great.  But it's not safe to drive down the road with your laptop anyway.  He eventually hung up, sounding more than a little annoyed that his router wasn't strong enough to reach him 50 miles away.

pyro-genesis,23,,31,1r1kgu,,233,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,47,,40,1r6dl6,,230,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

OldPolishProverb,7,,31,1r8b6k,,214,"IBackground; I work in a college IT department. Our IT work area is one large common room. One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass. You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home. 

As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didn't like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it. He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift. What was happening is that the film lost its ""stick"" after being pulled off an put back on day after day for a couple of weeks.

mdsnbelle,34,,31,1r8mwy,,207,"Backstory: I support a school system.

Our middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting.  The elementary schools don't. After a couple of cycles of trying to guess for the reporting, I finally convinced my boss to make this a full-on directive from the Superintendent.  It went out in August with reminders in September and October.

After several schools failed to comply, we identified our bad eggs, sent them to the head of the IT department, and he distributed them to the  schools that haven't complied.

That's when the excuses started.  Not from the principals, the secretaries who should have been doing this the entire time. They keep claiming they ""did it before,"" but the system deleted their records.  That's what they told their bosses, who are now telling their bosses, who is now telling my boss's boss that that's what happened.  Luckily, my boss and I know that that's 100% not possible. **The system does not magically delete data that wasn't there in the first place!**  I'm just pissed that the custom system I helped design (that I've now given 8 years of my life to) has this reputation of deleting data at will when it's the sheer fucking laziness of my users and their unwillingness to get caught not doing their jobs that is causing the downfall of its reputation.

the_unusual_suspect,15,,23,1r9cpz,,178,"So this was maybe a year ago, but I just haven't sat down to right about it.

I used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits. They also resold T1 circuits, and things of that nature. On top of that, they also provided point-to-point wireless access, VOIP, webhosting, and e-mail.

Providing support for resold internet really isn't as bad as you think -- especially considering I was T2, and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center. Simple stuff. And VOIP never really caused any issues.

What did cause issues was e-mail. 

We actually hosted our own e-mail server. I couldn't tell you what we used off the top of my head right now, but it was linux based (all of our software was). And that's fine -- it was free and simple. Only... it wasn't updated regularly... or ever.

So eventually we arrive to the day in question. 

As you may have guessed, we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question. Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form, so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted. Well, we started receiving a series of... interesting emails. After a quick google search it turns out it's a very basic SQL injection used to, essentially, retrieve the password for an email account. Thing is if you grab the right one... say our network administrators email password, well... that's when the trouble can start (especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins). Or so I thought -- it's actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using. I'll get into that in a minute.

So, me and my co-worker inform our network admin. He takes a look, and bans the IP abusing the form. That was it. Fantastic. We have no idea whats been accessed. I inform everyone I can, and they assure me our network admin will take care of it. And that is that, as they say.

Well, not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam. Our internal email accounts, and our customer email accounts. It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs. I'm talking verizon, yahoo, charter -- it was just unbelievable. So as our network admin is ""looking for a solution"" me and my coworker investigate on our own.

Now, i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right. Well guess what? Email is hosted via that server as well. Which isn't that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHING.

So, how it works if you're unfamiliar is as follow.

SSH into our server (we allowed the access). And from there all you had to do was keep '..'ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts. Oh, and you didn't need a password to get into them. YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT. One other thing -- sudo commands freely fucking available. And there's our god damned problem.

So now we're a god damned ISP that, when I check, was responsible for .01% of the entire spam coming across the internet. That's a shit load.

Of course this was immediately brought up to our network admin, and the owner. I don't know how to emphasize absolute and total despair, but they DIDN'T FUCKING BELIEVE US. You know what they blamed it on? Spoofing. FUCKING SPOOFING. Sorry, it still infuriates me.

They tried implementing ""solutions"" but nothing really panned out -- which you know, is because someone had unfettered access to our shit. It was a constant fight until the day I quit. My coworker quit the same day. It was interesting.

ViolentLambs,40,,32,1r7gk3,,165,"I went to a vocational school for three years (10th-12th grade) and I took electronics and robotics. A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home. Installed windows seven and happily took the PC to its owner in computer office technology.

I don't know that client didn't notice or at least check for those roach things.. That was the first time I ever encountered something like that.

FenrisFrost,51,,22,1r7yh4,,153,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?!

PotatoRoll,60,,22,1r88u6,,137,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

Gambatte,29,,20,1r0tjr,,129,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

RoninSpartan,17,,32,1r251v,,115,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---
GOD_OF_IT = network admin

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

effingWitchDoctor,8,,21,1r8pky,,116,"Hi again, TFTS. 

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

She couldn't see the file clearly labeled so she proceeded to download it again and again and again..... So finally she listens to me, finds the download window and installs it.

I walk past his office the other day and his monitor is decidedly blue.  I stop, turn around, and ask him about it. He's got no idea, it just started happening that morning.  I ask him about the VGA cable from the monitor to his dock, he says he replugged it at both ends but it didn't help.  I'm busy and technically not IT anymore, so I shrug, tell him to try a reboot and if it doesn't work, call $DerpContractIT.  

He hollers at me the other a couple days ago (his office is 6' away from my cubicle) and I pop my head into his office.  Monitor is still blue, and he's got an Excel sheet open that's almost unreadable.  I futz with the settings on the OSD (with him helpfully chiming in that he can't mouse-click on the OSD - thanks, Captain Dumbass), but nothing makes a difference. I tell him to hang on while I find another monitor cable, and dig a DVI cable out of the server room.

I unplug the VGA cable and shove it through the desk grommet, plug in the DVI and push it through.  Go around and under the desk to feed it back up to the laptop dock and it's just a hair short. I get it through the grommet near the dock and go back topside.  

I need to move the dock to the right a couple inches, but there's nearly no slack in the cables.  I wrestle it over, but it's nearly touching his desk phone, so I try to move that over.  It moves maybe a half inch.

Back under the desk, the cables had been ""managed"" within an inch of their lives. The dude who did the cable management used short screws and the keyhole hangers on the surge protector to get it out of the way, then cheap, one-way zip ties on those self-adhesive loops to get the cables off the floor.  There's zero slack anywhere.  The zip-ties can't be cut with scissors, and I don't want to take a razor to them. The guy had apparently pulled the zip-ties too tight, as the loose DVI cable works fine.  

I shake my head, apologize for the interruption, and question the wisdom of using a dude who had never in his life done cable management to do cable management.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

Cloudedguardian,38,,19,1rcp13,,96,"Hi TFTS, I've been a lurker for over a year now, and I'm certainly no IT girl, but I think this still counts, and that you'll all get a kick out of this. 

I am known by my local friends as 'The Smart One"", and as such, when one of my local friends had a tech issue, I'm often asked if I could sort it out for them. It's often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button, if not just turning it on and off again.

Well one day, the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand. Let's call her Red. Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook, as I had a rather nice laptop that I'd gotten for graduation that I had, to quote, ""Done some cool crap with."" Well, she's my friend, and I like learning about computers, so I figured I could give it a shot.

Red pulls out her Notebook, turns it on, and logs on, before clicking Firefox to load up her internet. My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up. I'm doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this, and start asking the obvious questions. (To me anyway)

Me: ""Well, have you cleared out your cache recently? It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your system.""

Red: ""My what?""

Now I knew that there was a possibility I wasn't using the correct terms, as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family, and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me. Dad always called what I was thinking of ""The Cache"" and so I didn't know what else to call it.

Me: ""Errr, it's like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web. Some sites are especially bad for it, and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them. Cheezburger, for instance. There's a program you run to clean it out, let me see if you have on-""

Here Red's Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off. ""Oh no, there's a button on that fox browser thing that does that.""

I blinked, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was talking about the ""Data management"" window that you can bring up. I resisted face-palming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms, and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused. 

Me: ""Errr, no, I think that's the browser cache. I'm talking about a different one on the computer itself, sorry, I might not be using the proper terms.""

Granny: ""Well I don't think clearing the computer is necessary, the browser fixes that stuff, Red's probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all up.""

At this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch, and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace. As I struggle to get anything to load, Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down. As I searched for an anti-cirus, a cleaner, *anything*, I said it was a possibility, before giving up and asking her what anti-virus she had. She said she didn't know what I meant.

Me: Like, uh, Norton, or McAfee? 

Red: Oh. No I ain't got that. Why?

Me: Well, I think you might have a virus. They're really easy for your computer to pick up if you don't have a proper anti-virus. It's probably what's gumming up your system.

Red: Ohhh. What are you doing?

I was, at that very second, looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned, with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton. I explained as such, and Red told me bluntly not to. I looked at her with a look of uttermost

Me: Wut.

Red: I downloaded somethin' like that a little while ago and it just made things worse. So don't.

I figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones, and tried to explain that. I think I lost her in the second sentence, so I gave up and just said that it wasn't a ""Proper"" anti-virus, but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people. She still wouldn't let me download it. As she took her Notebook back, with me conceding defeat, I suggested that, if she didn't want to download the free one, she could always go to Staples and buy Norton. I added that it was what I had, and would clean, repair, and kill all the virus, and it was very simple to use. It was mega-on-sale at the moment, and wouldn't be a bad idea. She told me she'd think about it, but it was a lot of money.

About a week later my sister (Black) and I seen Red with a brand new laptop. I asked her what happened with her Notebook, and she said that since it was so slow, she'd just gone and bought a new one. I blinked. 

Me: So it wasn't a virus? Cleaning it didn't help? Well that su-

Red: Oh no I didn't clean it or nuthin', I just chucked it and bought a new one instead.

Me: Wut. 

Black: Please tell me you didn't throw that Notebook in the trash.

Red: Nah, it's too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash. My friend actually wanted it, if you can believe it. So I let her have it.

Me: D-did you at least get Norton for your new computer? Like, does your new laptop have some sort of an anti-virus?

Red: Nah, it doesn't need that junk. It's all fast and new, I'm not gonna have any problems with this baby at all.

Black: You are going to become this store's best buckin' friend, ain't'cha, Ahou?

IsilZha,29,,20,1rghh8,,96,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

lawtechie,24,,24,1r39ta,,92,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away.

Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,35,,8,1r518r,,86,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Gambatte,14,,11,1r406j,,86,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

adun153,9,,15,1rc5va,,86,"First time posting here  :)

I work at the IT department of a pretty big University, and despite being a SysAd, sometimes I have to field calls, as we have no regular helpdesk.

One day a woman calls in, she says she needs help because she ""can't receive e-mails"" for several days now. I ask her the usual questions to help me understand her setup (is she using our Web Mail or Thunderbird, etc), but either she doesn't understand at all what I'm talking about, or she is being difficult on purpose.

After some time, I give up asking questions, and direct her to access the Web frontend, and login.

Upon loading up the Web Mail on her browser, she gets excited and  says ""Aha! Yes, yes, I can't receive my mail from here.""

To make a very long story short, the problem was that she had forgotten her password.

FenrisFrost,12,,15,1r8m9g,,78,"This one is from a co-worker, a quickie: 

A woman calls up and needs some remote troubleshooting done, she says her screen has gone blank. It's determined that the monitor has died after being left on 24-7 for 5 years or so, and a new one gets sent out. 

The woman is concerned about hooking it up herself. My co-worker explains to her what a VGA cable is, and that it's a big blue box and all she has to do is plug the new one into the wall with one cable and attach the new cord with the blue box on the computer. 

He gets a call a few weeks later for the same machine, the lady says she can't figure out how to attach the ""blue thingy"" and could we please send someone to help. he gets on the phone and talks her through it but she keeps telling him odd things like ""it just falls right out even if I turn the screws"" and ""should I push it all the into the computer?"" Nothing but angry ""no video"" beeps. 

As a last resort we're allowed to make onsite visits so finally he is able to go to the office and see for himself what has happened: On the back of the PC, there is a gaping hole where the video port was. The case itself has been torn open. He asks what happened. 

""Oh well I just couldn't get that darn blue wire off no matter what I did! So I pulled and pulled but it still wouldn't come loose! Then I put my foot on it and pulled as hard as I could and it still wouldn't come out! So I had $somebigguywhoworkshere help me pull it. We pulled and pulled and eventually with $somebigguy and $securityguard helping me, it FINALLY came out. But I don't know where to plug in the new one.""

She had torn the video card, its port, and the panel it was seated in on the tower clear out of the machine, cracking the motherboard somehow in the process.

FenrisFrost,8,,11,1r5ce7,,75,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves.

squigglechicken,5,,14,1r2dr9,,68,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. That's terrible.""

Lexmark Tech: ""Yeah... ummmm... call back tomorrow... I guess?""

lawtechie,17,,8,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,8,1rg6w8,,67,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

I work as a Tape Backup Operator for a large banking corporation.  My job description: Sit on ass until there's a ticket submitted to either enter or eject tapes into large robotic libraries.

Today is going to be a long Monday...
Ticket initially submitted at 12:03pm EST to eject 
130 (We'll call it Series 1) tapes.  After ~30 minutes, OverseasGuy requests we return the ticket with no other explanation.  Meh, fine...whatever.  I already dragged a metal cart that holds 240 tapes upstairs and across the building to get 'em...but whatever.  So I haul the cart back downstairs to our storage area, and go back to my lunch which he so rudely interrupted.  

We receive the ticket again at 1:56pm EST changing it from 130 Series 1 tapes to 200 Series 2 tapes.  32 tapes are ejected (after telling OverseasGuy we can do 39 at a time...that's how much the door holds...for some reason this library has issues setting up a queue like the other machines, so they have to do it one door at a time).  I close the door waiting for the next set....nothing.  Multiple attempts to contact OverseasGuy were made with no response.  At 3:01pm EST, OverseasGuy comes back with ""Sorry, i was at lunch""; machine ejects 32 more (mind you, I've already instructed the operator it can eject 39 per door) tapes.  No more activity...it's now 3:22pm EST.

Edit:  It is now 4:05pm EST, the last 39 are ejecting out of the machine now!  From 12:03pm to past 4pm (I leave at 4:30...woohoo!), an operation was completed that usually takes no more than half an hour!

samurai-technician,9,,9,1r1iti,,68,"One of our salesmen, we'll call him Moron, asks me if I can handle an installation of an new VoIP recording system with an integration we are not familiar with.


Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.


""What do you prefer,"" he asks me, ""a rack-mount server or a tower server?""


This is not going to go well. ""Why don't you ask the customer what they prefer?""


""That's a good idea."" He's been a salesman with the company for the past 9 years.


Moron orders an analog recording card from the manufacturer. I gazed alternatively at the packing slip and the contents of the box, back and forth with mouth agape in disbelief.


""Moron! You ordered an analog card and analog licenses. We don't use cards for VoIP."" I figuratively exclaimed.

""Did you order a rack or a tower?""


""I'm not going to order the server until the week of the install so we can maximize utilizing the warranty."" He talks like a brochure when he knows he's in trouble. Since, even when he eats lunch he's in over his head, he talks like a moron all the time.


""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in. I have no issues with dropping everything else to rush getting it configured with the OS properly installed and updated, and the new software that we have never seen or worked with before installed and configured.
If you get your timing right, I’ll take it out of the box on the day of the install. I understand that three weeks time is crucial to maximize a warranty."" I was angry. This was my best, most eloquent sarcasm.

Nothing hugely special, I don't work in tech support, just a 20 year old travelling and currently living in France sharing an apartment with a French woman.

I discovered we share a similar taste in music and she often asked to use my computer to play music when I wasn't using it until I decided to put it on her Freebox hard drive (I think customers of the Free service here get a hard drive attached to/as part of their router, not sure really) which is accessible when connected to her wifi network.

Easy. Later that night I showed her where it was, what I'd put there, she was happy, excited almost, and we left it there.

Today I got home and she's playing around on her computer. I sit down and she says (in French, she speaks no English and I speak a little French) she can't open the music. First thought is I may have only created shortcuts somehow and now my computer is off the network so she can't access it. Before I grab my computer I ask her to show me what's happening. She pulls up windows explorer (whatever Windows equivalent of Finder is, I'm an OS X person, so sue me), navigates to the Freebox drive, double clicks ""disque dur"" and then clicks ""musique"".

I get a panicked call from one of the branches that a printer has been printing out multiples of the same document over and over until the printer is shut off, and when the printer is turned back on, it keeps printing. I tell them to leave the printer off, and that I'd be right out. 

When I get there, I hear the tales of woe from the staff, and go about checking everything. I check the workstation, the print server, the release station, and ask the staff if the customer had wanted more than one copy. Nothing indicated anything out of the ordinary. 

I turned the printer on, and it proceeded to start spitting out multiple copies of the document that had been printing previously. I mashed the heck out of the Cancel Job button to stop it. I test printed a document from one of the staff computers, and the same thing happened. 

I went back to the printer and began flipping through the menus, and there it was.

""Copies: 65534""

One day I'm chilling in shop messing around with our little Lego NXT robot and Z walks in. I graduated with her and she was a weird and crazy one but she comes in, calls me over, and asks for a repair form. I hand her one, fills it out real quick, and I ask her what problems she's having. 

After a short discussion she tells me that its incredibly slow and she thinks it has a virus. I tell her I get started on it and check back tomorrow. I put it on my bench hook up its charger power dat dell on and waited what felt like ten minutes. I get to the logon and she didn't give me her password.

Run avg and it said it found over 1000 infected files! I let it do its thing but it took so long that i had to wait till the next day to finish up.

I come into shop. Fast forward last theory and im in lab. I check her laptop and not only did avg remove all the viruses it made it more faster and tolerable to use. I open internet explorer and no waiting its fast and responds like its supposed to. I open task manager and it doesn't freeze or crash. I opened chrome and it ran great i decided to download a random wallpaper to replace the black one the viruses put. Dragged it to the desktop. Changed the wallpaper and dragged it to the recycle bin but I accidentally dragged a photo that wasnt what I used there so i open up recycle bin and..

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up.

I work grunt level support for the uni I attend. Mostly my duties include answering phones, fixing people's moble wireless settings, and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support.  However, during the summers, some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers. New purchases are imaged, added to a domain, and have special software deployed based on where its going. Old relics leaving service  are KillDisc-ed, scavenged for parts, and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling. Its not a bad gig.


In order to maintain some degree of CYA, when computers arrive to be out-processed and recycled we keep them for 15 days before wiping them. This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine, it can still be recovered. Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience. 

Too bad that ""Most of the time"" is not "" All of the time""

This particular incident began with me arriving, caffeine in thermos, book in hand, for another day of processing. I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen, noting the paperwork. According to the paperwork, I can wipe it.  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights. ( I used to sing Daisy, Daisy while i worked, but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath, I laughed and said "" no im just grunt support"" )

I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed ""Professor. Derpingtons"" computer yet. I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me. Then, as if it were fate, I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on, lo and behold its Derpington's. 

""Not boss, I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press go""

""Well the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so don't kill it yet""

""Ok, should I get his files off for him?""

""No he says he needs them ASAP, Hes coming here to get them""

I double take, Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility. Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map.  The idea of a Bambi-eyed professor navigating our wire strewn, technological reliquary of a faculty is novel, if not terrifying. 

Soon the professor arrives, luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before. I walk him through several rooms, each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation. I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him. He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files. 

I step away for while, I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files. So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves. The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime, based on the volume of the fans. 

""Sir, are you done?"" I move to turn the monitor back on ""I can shut it down and walk you to the exit""

""NO WAIT"" he reaches out to stop me.

I reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight. The windows file transfer dialog, with its loading bar, animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive. 

Hold on.....

300GB of files are being moved.....

from a folder labeled ""NOT PORN"".......

My discovery happens in an instant, and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again. 

""that is private, Students should not be rooting through professors files!""

""yes sir, my mistake"" I begin walking out "" Give me a call when your finished"". I round the corner and keep walking, I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away, I double over and laugh for a while. eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington, Lord of Not Pornia. 

""So what happens now?"" he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine. I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data. He demands that he wants to witness the wiping, ""for security reasons"". I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was 300GB of Not porn was...""For Science"". But he stood by for 40 minutes as killdisc did its magic. 

I escorted him out and he thanked me and my boss, promising to ""put in a good word for IT because of our good work here"".  As he left, I avoided shaking his hand. 

Edit: the're in there with their bear.

Amaltron,15,,6,1r5o8x,,53,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

TheProfessorX,15,,15,1r8czm,,50,"Hello TFTS! Long time lurker here and first time poster!

I had this phone call happen to me earlier. I work as a Help Desk/Network Specialist/Hardware/Software/Systems Admin/Network Admin/Jack of all Trades person at a small time local computer service company in my city. It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive! Most of my calls are helping retired old ladies learn their new Windows 8 computers, replacing the ink cartridges for them (as we do house calls as well), or cleaning out spyware and the like. Pretty routine, but occasionally, I'll actually get to do the stuff I enjoy the most like rebuilding networks, troubleshooting server issues, more tier 2-3 stuff if you get what I mean.

For this story, our callers name will be McFurty.

Prof. X: [COMPUTER COMPANY] this is Prof. X, how can I help you today?

McFurty: Oh! Hey there! Oh my, I'm so glad I got a hold of y'all. My computer, it isn't working! I tried holding down the button at the bottom waiting for all the lights to come off and then on again and I tried unplugging it and plugging it back on but nothing!

Prof X: I'm sorry to hear you're having issues getting you're computer to turn on, Mrs. McFurty. Let's see what we can do to get you back up and running again. I'm just gonna ask some basic questions first to get started.

McFurty: Well okay!

Prof X: Are there any lights currently on the front of the PC or is there any picture going to your monitor? 

McFurty: Prof. X is there any way you can come over today? I mean, my husband has some checks to send out and we really need the computer to work.

Prof X: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but unfortunately I already have appointments scheduled for later this afternoon at the opposite side of town, I can make you an appointment for Monday if you really want me to be there in person to troubleshoot.

McFurty: Wait! It looks like somethings happening!

Prof X: How do you mean? Could you tell me if there's anything on the screen or lights on the PC?

McFurty: YES! THERE IS! OH, PRAISE JESUS! IT LOOKS LIKE IT HEALED ITSELF WHILE I WAS AT BIBLE STUDY!

FenrisFrost,13,,2,1r678j,,53,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*."" 


I hear his Outlook notification go off just then. Found out later it was one of his best admins giving his notice, citing this policy change as his reason. ",Good timing,55,TalesFromTechsupport

frozenfoxy,1,,7,1r1o5q,,48,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,55,TalesFromTechsupport

rat_in_your_basement,27,,19,1rejzv,,46,"I'm my own stupid user in this story. This is from back when I still had a Win XP SP3 (on a 64-bit processor at that), and had zero IT experience. I'm hazy on the technical details, and have no clue how I got the virus in the first place, but here goes:

I started to run into this issue with my web browsers (except for Rockmelt, the virus wasn't compatible with Rockmelt), where clicking on links in a Google search window would cause me to be redirected to a very shady looking site full of even shadier advertisements. Like hell are there only fifteen local singles in my area. I had Malwarebytes, but after dozens of failed scans, I was able to conclude that whatever it was that made it onto my computer would cause a BSOD upon detection. Being inexperienced, I either had no clue about all of Malwarebytes' little tools to get around that, or they didn't exist back then.

One way or another, I decided to try my luck with encryption. Google (unbeknownst to most of the world) runs an [encrypted version of their search engine](https://encrypted.google.com), and I ended up relying heavily on it, as it seemed to get around the malicious software. 

A little while later, I installed [Windows Network Monitor](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=4865) and ran an unencrypted Google search. Upon doing the search, Network Monitor told me what file had accessed the internet and caused my redirect. Upon scanning it with MBAM, BSOD. No huge surprise. I considered simply deleting it, but Windows 7 had just come out, and that was just one of many issues that had accumulated on that machine over the years.

So I did what any sane man would do: got a copy of Windows 7, and formatted the crap out of my hard-drive. No more virus, no more problem.",User VS Virus,65,TalesFromTechsupport

The tech goes on site to replace a failed drive on the server. After the drive is replaced he calls to let the derp desk know and they see another drive degraded and want it replaced. Since the tech knows how RAID 5 works he tells them that this is a bad idea until the set rebuilds and engages our second level to CYA.

After much documentation on this situation (and the derp desk refusing to listen) second level tells the tech to replace the drive.

Kataclysm,28,,3,1r2eke,,41,"I work in IT. I've been involved professionally for going on seven years now, and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on 20. I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This, ladies and gentlemen, was my introduction into the world of information technology: a man faced the new hires and gave what I now refer to as the Speech Of Doom.  And I decided that one thing, aside from the computer maintenance and network operations and and and that comes with IT, one thing I decided I wanted to do was give that speech to the new hires some day.

I have modified my own, just in case I ever meet the day where I am allowed to give this speech.  I plan on threatening the theft of the soul of the policy violators through their pupils - in a way that is so painful, there will be no anesthetic that could ever hope to kill that pain.

SkraeNocturne,8,,7,1r8y9u,,30,"So, my client has tasked me with replacing computers in the warehouse and on the production floor.  Last month, their IT/DB person quit to go to another job, and I'm still ecstatic for her (employee satisfaction at this client is almost nonexistent, it was worst for her).  We're coming up on a month and a half, and I'm only just now hearing from my boss that they're going to be hiring somebody because they were convinced that they would never need a database person again.

Back to the story, one of the computers on my replacement list is one they use for &lt;large shipping company well known for their orange and purple logo&gt; shipping, and use &lt;shipping company&gt;'s proprietary software.  All well and fine.  I'm doing my best not to have to call their tech support, even though my limited experience with them has been great.  Low wait times, quick resolution.

Right now, I'm having trouble with the database integration since I don't have any documentation on what databases are what, where do they pull info, etc.  I have been implicitly forbidden by the client from asking &lt;previous DB person&gt; what I need to do for anything around here, nor do I want to remind her of the ""system"" here.  So I ask their EDI guy, and the guy they keep around because the owner is too softhearted to let him go because he's been around here since the dawn of time, even though he doesn't technically have a job to do anymore, and hasn't for some time now (probably since the start of the information age, I would guess).  But since he has had experience with their EDI system from a decade ago, I've been told to talk to him if there's a problem.  Let's call him Dan.

I just got done speaking with him because I was out of options:

ME:  Hey, Dan, do you know what data source the shipping data is pulled from?

DAN:  That would be &lt;Access database&gt;.  *Fuck*

ME:  I'm pretty sure it needs to pull from SQL...

DAN:  No, here, let me bring up &lt;Access database&gt; and show you.

ME:  *Crap...*  Ok, but I really don't think this is what I need to do...

DAN:  No, no, here.  See these tables?  That stores the shipping info, so you need to import these three tables into &lt;shipping company software&gt;.

ay_gov,2,,4,1r5zu4,,29,"Two instances of people who should know better not knowing better...  To be fair they are contractors so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.


**Instance the First**

I receive an email request with probably 7 people involved in the email chain. AD account with local server admin rights needed for an application install.

I go through the requisite steps of setting up the account, applying the expiration date, restricting the logon to that application server, adding admin rights on that application server.  Quick and easy!

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.  Well, the person he has cc'd is tech illiterate (read: my OS is Internet Explorer) so I'm not that fussed.  Return to my coffee and indulge in some Reddit....

Until I receive yet another email.  This time it's the project coordinator from the company replying to everyone in the email chain.... with the email I sent to the tech with his account details as an attachment.  Holy hell , Batman!  Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

The fail became to strong for my co-worker and he is currently off getting some air or possibly murdering people.

It was a decently slow friday night and was just about to end my shift and was updating my overnight replacement about an issue that might come back up for one of our clients and telling them if one of our clients main application links stops working where the secondary URL is for a work around. 
I get a call 2 minutes before I'm due off where our only 24/7 center reports they cannot access one of our clients training sites.

I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.  I thank him for his assistance and hang up.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with.

The winter of 1993 shimmers lithely in distant memory. My company was two groups: the artsy-fartsy liberals at the far end of the building deeply engrossed in their oh-so-important work for humanity and the technical group that made it all possible at the other end of the building.


The only technically competent individual in the artsy fartsy group was ironically the oldest, with one foot out the door and one deeply engrossed. His 'weltanschauung' was enlightening, he was always smiling--or perhaps smirking, and he drank coffee whose beans were roasted after they passed through a Lemur's ass. He was the only one of both ends of the building who had acquired a 9600 baud modem from the company at large. He knew how to work it too, boy. We didn't have to show him 'nuthin'. Our operations were on 1200 baud modems and less, and this guy gets to have his own 9600 baud modem.


He knew the AT command set and that commanded respect.


During the third shift, we, and when I say we, I mean mostly--if not only I would sit at his station--on his PC. We would dial in to the local BBS and...be part of the nascent internet. I would later have to defend my 'abuse' of the equipment and phone records of dialing into what was called...The Love Connection BBS? What I learned by doing this turned into knowledge to save the day that one time.


One day, during NBH, he reports to me a connectivity issue. He can dial up and connect, but cannot use Telix or Procomm to get any further. He demonstrates entirely from the various command lines. Probably something to do with that PPTP stuff. 


I call the local ISP...the only one channel in the galaxy...of cheap, reliable PINE and GOPHER play. He and I even had an email address from them--a real novelty. The kid at the help desk begins his script.

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

FredFltStn,175,,408,1r22gy,,1193,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

Two weeks later he brings it back because it wouldn't boot. After some poking around, I noticed that the Software and System registry hives were empty, and looking on disk, the files that held them were only 256kB in size, but apparently the real hives were still there, just renamed to have .iobit extension (WTF?).

After I solved that, Windows slowly booted, logged in, desktop appeared, and after some half minute an animated snail appeared in the lower right corner with ""Computer speed: slow - optimize now!"" written under it. But before I could do anything, Windows froze (mouse pointer stopped moving, no disk activity, wouldn't respond to ping). Since the same thing happened after several reboots, I went into Safe Mode and looked at Programs and Features: 3 Start Menu replacements (one we provided, two installed later), 5 different optimizers, several Registry cleaners, countless toolbars. As there were other problems (registry permissions were screwed up so badly that you couldn't change view modes in Explorer), I simply reinstalled Windows (and upgraded to 8.1, which came out that day).

Techsupportvictim,40,,190,1ral73,,839,"Gent comes in to our store a couple of weeks ago. Issue with his laptop. I don't actually recall what the issue was in the end but we needed to send it to our repair depot. At least three days out of his hands, as many as seven. 

He needed to back up his stuff cause apparently he never had in the almost year he had had it. So we had gotten him a hard drive, showed him out to set it up etc. 

Game plan, he goes home, backs it up and then drops it off and we send it out. With luck they don't have too many machines and it's back fast. 

Roll forward two weeks and he comes in to drop it out off morning. Saturday. To be shipped via a third party that doesn't pick up on Saturdays to go to a center that isn't open on Sundays anyway. 

I'm not the one doing the paperwork but I can hear the whole thing from my post.

Tech taking it in tells him that it will go out Monday with luck by delivered back on Wednesday, maybe Thursday. 

To wit the guy yells out him that he is leaving to go out of the country first thing Monday morning and must have his computer for the trip. Now remember this all started two weeks ago and we could have sent it out that day if he'd been backing it up like a good user (double since he uses this for business it seems) 

The tech explains to him that this is not a repair we can do in store because we don't have the proper tools and parts and they would take a week to arrive even if we could get them. And according to the notes he knew two weeks ago what needed to be done. All very calmly.

Rhywden,119,,117,1r99ob,,625,"This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a medium-sized students' dormitory (~500 connected clients).

Physical layout consisted of 4 houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches, thus providing 100 Mbit connections. 

So, one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door: ""Internet is down!""

First thing to check: Local issue? Tried connecting to the router remotely - no dice. Not only is the ""Internet down"" but the whole network. Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking, also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked. Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than I'll ever learn.

However, he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error. Uplink - fine. No errors in the logs. Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active ones!
We tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything. TCPdump didn't show any incoming traffic on our network facing card.

Until, by pure chance (or maybe desperation?), we rebooted the switches. Because the network suddenly came to life again... and ground to a halt mere seconds later.

Okay, time for another reset, this time with TCPdump to watch what's happening. And that's when we saw it: A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros (yes, even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port) and just one single 0x0F somewhere. And it flooded the network for the short time it worked.

We then worked out what had obviously happened: Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they _appeared_ to still be working (I kid you not, if you didn't watch them closely you'd notice nothing - it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didn't change over time as it usually would in a live network).

The solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again. That way we discovered the culprit - who wasn't home at the time (of course). He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC (which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download) had bluescreened which obviously didn't agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could.",The TCP packet of death,742,TalesFromTechsupport

curried_avenger,49,,116,1rbq0v,,551,"Follow up story to [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1rbh79/not_so_fine_print/)

As I said before, I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront, with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customers.

Now, like most service departments, the technicians don’t work weekends, but the retail department is open 7 days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up - no real issue, it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekends.

It was a busy Sunday, which was unusual for this particular store, and staff were handling customers.  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store - no big deal, it’s where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section, so the staff think nothing of it.  Nothing, until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock room.

Turns out, one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friend’s laptop, and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store) before their friend had class on Monday.  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for, within reason, it didn’t matter to management when the work was done.

He starts pulling on the door, which is locked by key-card access.  He then starts knocking.

The technician, a lovely lady in her mid-twenties, was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement.  Having seen this guy, she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the door’s window.

The man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperation.

“Is she fucking ignoring me?!”

The customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out.  I thank him and move over to stop this guy’s impatience from escalating.  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help with.

“You guys need to sort this out.  I’m here to pick up my wife’s laptop, and your staff are all ignoring me.  That one out back is on the fucking phone!  I’m parked in a loading zone and I can’t wait.”

I apologise and say I will get things moving.  I look up the guy’s job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier.  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary, his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next, from about ten days ago.  We only heard back from her on Wednesday, four days ago, to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered, installed and the system tested.

“I know that, but obviously I’m here now and I’m not leaving without it.”

Now, I have two options.  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard (which arrived on Saturday with the other parts), or I could tell this guy that technicians don’t work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period, unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service (twice the regular hourly charge) for the entirety of the job (with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash, if she agrees to do it).

“This is bullshit - I can see her back there.  Right now, I am looking at her right now,” he said as he pointed at her.  “She was on the fucking phone.  You should prioritise your customers in the store, for fucks sale.  What kind of outfit is this?”

At this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole, and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants.  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today, and I explain why that was not going to happen:

* Technicians do not work on weekends;
* His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked;
* The girl in the back was not working today; and
* I could fast-track the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon, at no extra charge, if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machine.

This took the better part of fifteen minutes.  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday, having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit.  He leaves the store in a huff.  

Two minutes later, he returns.

Meltingteeth,132,,118,1rguyg,,572,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

dalgeek,55,,66,1rforv,,417,"In this age of high speed computing and security, keeping accurate time is a must.  Some people just depend on time.windows.com, some use Tier2 NTP sources on the Internet, while others go the extra mile and buy their own GPS-driven time-keeping appliance.  I mean, what could be more reliable than having a highly accurate time source right on your own low-latency network?

I get a call from a customer one morning ""All of the phone systems are down!  Call processing, call centers, everything!""  I VPN in and start checking alerts; all sorts of strange alerts, mostly regarding invalid security certificates, but also database replication errors.  I check the certificates and they're still valid.  Database replication won't rebuild no matter what I do.  Agents can't log in even with correct passwords.  As I check the system status the date scrolls by quickly and I do a double take: April 1992?

Everything is sync'ed to NTP so that's the first place I look.  Sure enough, the NTP appliance seems to think it is 1992.  Due to some obscure hardware failure, the appliance lost GPS lock and decided to pick an arbitrary date in 1992 as the current time.  It would have been better if the thing just stopped working completely instead of giving out false time.  I shut down the network port on the appliance and added its IP address to the core switch so that everything could get somewhat correct time.  The network and databases slowly came back to life as the time was fixed.

Pretty much everything that depended on SSL or Kerberos failed.  The certificates were invalid not because they had expired, but they were not yet active!  Some systems happily set their clock back to 1992 because the NTP server said so, while others said ""waaait a minute"" and ignored the obviously erroneous time; now those two systems can't talk to each other.

Gambatte,72,,83,1rduku,,376,"Before the beginning, there was nothingness - a void so complete that the passage of time - even the very concept of time itself - was meaningless. Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits (having brought them with it, because - as one would expect by it's very definition - the larder of the eternal void was quite empty), and generally just messed up the whole boundless void. With a sigh, entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruption.

*Shortly after that,* I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths (PFY) when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment. Being a simple job, I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said check.

He promptly returned bearing the bad news: the coolant levels were low, and would require replenishment.

Seeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs, of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously, I assembled the group and informed them of said task.

&gt; ME: Any questions?

&gt; PFY: This coolant... Is it hazardous? What PPE (personal protective equipment) should we be using?

*Oh ho,* I thought, *A learning opportunity.*

&gt; ME: Excellent question, PFY. I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop. From there, you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to. So your job is now...

&gt; PFY: ...to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we need?

&gt; ME: Well done. Once you've done that, gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin - I'll come up to make sure that you do it properly.

So the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described. I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details as:

&gt; **Specific personal protective equipment:**

&gt; *Respiratory:*

&gt; None required.

&gt; *Eyes:*

&gt; Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquid.

&gt; *Hands:*

&gt; Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplated.

&gt; *Other clothing and equipment:*

&gt; Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vapor.

and

&gt; Compound is known as ""the universal solvent"" and does dissolve, at least to some extent, most common materials. 

So after a considerable period of time (far longer than it should have taken, really, but not longer than I had expected), I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedure.

I arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields, rubber aprons, rubber boots, and rubber gloves. A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on, ready to engage should the first two be overcome.

*This seems a little excessive,* I thought. Aloud, I instructed them to begin.

As it turns out, the PFYs had broken the task up into groups. The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling. Of course, he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do so.

As the coolant began to pour into the system, a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding 'dihydrogen monoxide' actually was...

*****

**FALLOUT:**

The PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety, then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS database.

The devious PFY was promoted to 2IC a few months later, and is still one of the very best I've ever had.

After about 3 trips I have settled into a fast and simple routine which allowed me to get the job done in about a day. The key component of  this routine, that's important to this story, is the laying out of all my cabling and equipment. 1 pile of blue ethernet cables, 1 pile of red, and one pile of orange fiber jumpers.

 A lot of the ""offices"" i visited would insist on placing one of their people with me so they could learn the ins and outs of the new equipment I was installing so they could (in theory) handle any issues after I departed.

The day comes when I arrive at one of the offices in Japan for an install and im immediately saddled with their incompetant version of tech support. While lady-tard is standing there observing me and asking questions non-stop, I ask her, ""Can you please hand me a red cross over cable?""

curried_avenger,34,,50,1rbh79,,322,"I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store.  We specialised in Apple products, and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customers.

One day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working, as she “can’t check her email”.  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all, and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard, requiring the computer to be formally booked into our on-site service system to arrange for parts and service.  I informed her of our (labour) prices, explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed within.

Having agreed to that, I begin getting her details to be entered into our system.  She gives me her phone number, but when I ask for an address…

“You don’t need that, actually.”


Now, how she expects to know what I need I didn’t understand, and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront - particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed, so we can’t really take prior payment since we don’t know what the extent of the repairs will be.

“I don’t want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyers.”

I explain that our service centre’s database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department, and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there.  I also explain that without a billing address our check-in software will not process the repair.

She reluctantly agrees, and I print out the form for her to sign.  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand (despite having a pen in front of her anyway) and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request - the ones pertaining to contact details.  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to *this particular service job* and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entity.

I ask her what she is doing.  

“I don’t want to be harassed by telemarketers.”

I ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with (not that I can negotiate different terms, but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson).  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her *under this very contract* is to speak with her in respect to this repair job, and show her the wording that says just that.  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation, and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of terms.

“Just get it done”.

She slides the service agreement towards me, grabs her handbag and walks out.  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it, given that I have not yet signed off on it.  The computer is in limbo and I can’t do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed.  However, I do have her phone number.  

I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it, and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned.  As it was not currently working, it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up, unless she requests that we hold onto it.  Naturally, she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us.  I inform her that there is a storage fee of $10 per day until the service request is completed.

She starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that it’s grabbing the attention of our other customers, even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all day.

A few hours later she storms into the store, with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson - a 16 year old girl - about how we are extorting her.  I step in and apologise for making her come back, and get the new agreement printed out.  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her, staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement as-is or leave with her computer.

She then goes quiet, and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hit…and starts sobbing.  Sobbing, and reading the terms she had earlier deleted.  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something, especially as she cried over the contract, and continued to sob as she signed it.  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a word.

Her husband was an asshole, too, but that’s a story for later.",Not so fine print,372,TalesFromTechsupport
curried_avenger,14,,46,1rbmxm,,305,"Sometimes, you gotta feel bad for a guy.

This was a slow day in the computer shop, so it’s just me and the manager (Mick) in our small branch, on university campus.  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive.  I say it’s possible, but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and it’s likely to be expensive.

An hour later a guy that is *the* picture of middle-management rocks into our store, out of breath and sweaty, presenting a password protected/encrypted USB key.

“This is it.”

Mick and share a glance at each other.

“I’m the guy that called you earlier,” shouts the customer.  “You know, about the data on the drive?” he pleads.

Mick takes a look at the drive, and notes it’s a secure drive that encrypts the data on it.

“What happened?”, I ask.

Turns out that the customer’s boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information. The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive, not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties.  Because the customer was a contractor, he was liable to lose his job over this.

Mick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts.  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering, it would appear as gibberish since it was encrypted.

The customer’s nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you, takes the drive, and leaves.

A couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer - a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me.  He mentions the drive, and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractor’s sister.  This contractor’s laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmin’s friends *very* unhappy, and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case.  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing, and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect - which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most people.

Sysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive, having been told it contained information pertaining to the university’s staff and payroll (i.e. highly sensitive data), for a proto-system to undergo testing with.  While the actual project was real, the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss, Sysadmin’s friend, Greg.  Of course, this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractor’s work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met.  Greg couldn’t actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractor’s inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himself.

Greg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password, and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing.  A simple task, but important.

In spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat, since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone, and data redundancy was an obvious step.  At least, until the rest of the story:

The contractor, having forgotten the password, destroying the (supposedly) only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced.  When Greg found the drive a few days later (plugged into the contractor’s computer FFS), the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty.  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor, the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data.  Understandably, his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonesty.

At this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughter.

lawtechie,21,,57,1r15nt,,295,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",352,TalesFromTechsupport

squigglechicken,72,,51,1r2ucm,,283,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

ilawlfase,55,,52,1rcyeh,,251,"Today I had a difficult call simply because of how not computer savvy my customer was.  Somehow, a tech came in, installed a new gateway...and didn't tell her the password, the name....and didn't even tell her she would have to connect to it.  So I got an angry as fuck customer telling me her internet wasn't working...and she never even tried to put in the password or network name in the first place.

But that's not even the call I wanted to tell you about.  Today's call reminded me of a customer that I recieved when I first started working at my current company.  This customer called wanting to get his wireless set up.  He'd never had it before, just a modem for his computer.  Now he has a small Mac laptop.  At the time it was dreadful for me because I didn't know much about Macs and until this job, probably wouldn't have.  But that's fine.  I told him where the network name was, and how to connect and how to input the password.  Then as I'm doing my ending and asking if there's anything else.  He asks me: ""So how far away can I use this?""


I was a little thrown off, but I figured he has a large house.  I told him it should work through a couple of rooms but if he has a large house he should invest in some range extenders.

""No, I mean.  If I jump in my car right now and put my laptop in the passenger seat, will I still be able to use it?""
I'm absolutely stumped.  I knew he'd never had wireless in his home, but has he ever used it before in his life?  When I told him that it doesn't work that way, he began to get upset and tell me he might cancel his service because he wanted to use his wireless anyway.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

pyro-genesis,23,,31,1r1kgu,,233,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,47,,40,1r6dl6,,230,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

OldPolishProverb,7,,31,1r8b6k,,214,"IBackground; I work in a college IT department. Our IT work area is one large common room. One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass. You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home.

mdsnbelle,34,,31,1r8mwy,,207,"Backstory: I support a school system.

Our middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting.  The elementary schools don't. After a couple of cycles of trying to guess for the reporting, I finally convinced my boss to make this a full-on directive from the Superintendent.

After several schools failed to comply, we identified our bad eggs, sent them to the head of the IT department, and he distributed them to the  schools that haven't complied.

the_unusual_suspect,15,,23,1r9cpz,,178,"So this was maybe a year ago, but I just haven't sat down to right about it.

I used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits. They also resold T1 circuits, and things of that nature. On top of that, they also provided point-to-point wireless access, VOIP, webhosting, and e-mail.

Providing support for resold internet really isn't as bad as you think -- especially considering I was T2, and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center. Simple stuff. And VOIP never really caused any issues.

What did cause issues was e-mail. 

We actually hosted our own e-mail server. I couldn't tell you what we used off the top of my head right now, but it was linux based (all of our software was). And that's fine -- it was free and simple. Only... it wasn't updated regularly... or ever.

So eventually we arrive to the day in question. 

As you may have guessed, we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question. Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form, so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted. Well, we started receiving a series of... interesting emails. After a quick google search it turns out it's a very basic SQL injection used to, essentially, retrieve the password for an email account. Thing is if you grab the right one... say our network administrators email password, well... that's when the trouble can start (especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins). Or so I thought -- it's actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using. I'll get into that in a minute.

So, me and my co-worker inform our network admin. He takes a look, and bans the IP abusing the form. That was it. Fantastic. We have no idea whats been accessed. I inform everyone I can, and they assure me our network admin will take care of it. And that is that, as they say.

Well, not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam. Our internal email accounts, and our customer email accounts. It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs. I'm talking verizon, yahoo, charter -- it was just unbelievable. So as our network admin is ""looking for a solution"" me and my coworker investigate on our own.

Now, i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right. Well guess what? Email is hosted via that server as well. Which isn't that big of a deal. What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHING.

So, how it works if you're unfamiliar is as follow.

SSH into our server (we allowed the access). And from there all you had to do was keep '..'ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts. Oh, and you didn't need a password to get into them. YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT. One other thing -- sudo commands freely fucking available. And there's our god damned problem.

So now we're a god damned ISP that, when I check, was responsible for .01% of the entire spam coming across the internet. That's a shit load.

Of course this was immediately brought up to our network admin, and the owner. I don't know how to emphasize absolute and total despair, but they DIDN'T FUCKING BELIEVE US. You know what they blamed it on? Spoofing. FUCKING SPOOFING. Sorry, it still infuriates me.

They tried implementing ""solutions"" but nothing really panned out -- which you know, is because someone had unfettered access to our shit. It was a constant fight until the day I quit. My coworker quit the same day. It was interesting.

A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home.

FenrisFrost,51,,22,1r7yh4,,153,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

PotatoRoll,60,,22,1r88u6,,137,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

I was still mad when I typed this, but I feel a lot better now.

Gambatte,29,,20,1r0tjr,,129,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

RoninSpartan,17,,32,1r251v,,115,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---
GOD_OF_IT = network admin

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

She kept telling me ""it's not popping up to install"". I told her that she needed to check her downloads window in Firefox (which was popped up on the screen). She couldn't see the file clearly labeled so she proceeded to download it again and again and again..... So finally she listens to me, finds the download window and installs it.

I walk past his office the other day and his monitor is decidedly blue.  I stop, turn around, and ask him about it. He's got no idea, it just started happening that morning.  I ask him about the VGA cable from the monitor to his dock, he says he replugged it at both ends but it didn't help.  I'm busy and technically not IT anymore, so I shrug, tell him to try a reboot and if it doesn't work, call $DerpContractIT.  

He hollers at me the other a couple days ago (his office is 6' away from my cubicle) and I pop my head into his office.  Monitor is still blue, and he's got an Excel sheet open that's almost unreadable.  I futz with the settings on the OSD (with him helpfully chiming in that he can't mouse-click on the OSD - thanks, Captain Dumbass), but nothing makes a difference. I tell him to hang on while I find another monitor cable, and dig a DVI cable out of the server room.

I unplug the VGA cable and shove it through the desk grommet, plug in the DVI and push it through.  Go around and under the desk to feed it back up to the laptop dock and it's just a hair short. I get it through the grommet near the dock and go back topside.  

I need to move the dock to the right a couple inches, but there's nearly no slack in the cables.  I wrestle it over, but it's nearly touching his desk phone, so I try to move that over.  It moves maybe a half inch.

Back under the desk, the cables had been ""managed"" within an inch of their lives. The dude who did the cable management used short screws and the keyhole hangers on the surge protector to get it out of the way, then cheap, one-way zip ties on those self-adhesive loops to get the cables off the floor.  There's zero slack anywhere.  The zip-ties can't be cut with scissors, and I don't want to take a razor to them. The guy had apparently pulled the zip-ties too tight, as the loose DVI cable works fine.  

I shake my head, apologize for the interruption, and question the wisdom of using a dude who had never in his life done cable management to do cable management.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

Cloudedguardian,38,,19,1rcp13,,96,"Hi TFTS, I've been a lurker for over a year now, and I'm certainly no IT girl, but I think this still counts, and that you'll all get a kick out of this. 

I am known by my local friends as 'The Smart One"", and as such, when one of my local friends had a tech issue, I'm often asked if I could sort it out for them. It's often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button, if not just turning it on and off again.

Well one day, the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand. Let's call her Red. Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook, as I had a rather nice laptop that I'd gotten for graduation that I had, to quote, ""Done some cool crap with."" Well, she's my friend, and I like learning about computers, so I figured I could give it a shot.

Red pulls out her Notebook, turns it on, and logs on, before clicking Firefox to load up her internet. My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up. I'm doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this, and start asking the obvious questions. (To me anyway)

Me: ""Well, have you cleared out your cache recently? It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your system.""

Red: ""My what?""

Now I knew that there was a possibility I wasn't using the correct terms, as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family, and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me. Dad always called what I was thinking of ""The Cache"" and so I didn't know what else to call it.

Me: ""Errr, it's like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web. Some sites are especially bad for it, and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them. Cheezburger, for instance. There's a program you run to clean it out, let me see if you have on-""

Here Red's Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off. ""Oh no, there's a button on that fox browser thing that does that.""

I blinked, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then I realized that she was talking about the ""Data management"" window that you can bring up. I resisted face-palming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms, and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused. 

Me: ""Errr, no, I think that's the browser cache. I'm talking about a different one on the computer itself, sorry, I might not be using the proper terms.""

Granny: ""Well I don't think clearing the computer is necessary, the browser fixes that stuff, Red's probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all up.""

At this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch, and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace. As I struggle to get anything to load, Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down. As I searched for an anti-cirus, a cleaner, *anything*, I said it was a possibility, before giving up and asking her what anti-virus she had. She said she didn't know what I meant.

Me: Like, uh, Norton, or McAfee? 

Red: Oh. No I ain't got that. Why?

Me: Well, I think you might have a virus. They're really easy for your computer to pick up if you don't have a proper anti-virus. It's probably what's gumming up your system.

Red: Ohhh. What are you doing?

I was, at that very second, looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned, with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton. I explained as such, and Red told me bluntly not to. I looked at her with a look of uttermost

Me: Wut.

Red: I downloaded somethin' like that a little while ago and it just made things worse. So don't.

I figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones, and tried to explain that. I think I lost her in the second sentence, so I gave up and just said that it wasn't a ""Proper"" anti-virus, but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people. She still wouldn't let me download it. As she took her Notebook back, with me conceding defeat, I suggested that, if she didn't want to download the free one, she could always go to Staples and buy Norton. I added that it was what I had, and would clean, repair, and kill all the virus, and it was very simple to use. It was mega-on-sale at the moment, and wouldn't be a bad idea. She told me she'd think about it, but it was a lot of money.

About a week later my sister (Black) and I seen Red with a brand new laptop. I asked her what happened with her Notebook, and she said that since it was so slow, she'd just gone and bought a new one. I blinked. 

Me: So it wasn't a virus? Cleaning it didn't help? Well that su-

Red: Oh no I didn't clean it or nuthin', I just chucked it and bought a new one instead.

Me: Wut. 

Black: Please tell me you didn't throw that Notebook in the trash.

Red: Nah, it's too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash. My friend actually wanted it, if you can believe it. So I let her have it.

Me: D-did you at least get Norton for your new computer? Like, does your new laptop have some sort of an anti-virus?

Red: Nah, it doesn't need that junk. It's all fast and new, I'm not gonna have any problems with this baby at all.

Black: You are going to become this store's best buckin' friend, ain't'cha, Ahou?

IsilZha,29,,20,1rghh8,,96,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
dreadpirate15_,8,,7,1r593s,,96,"I provide support for a certain large retail chain, among other companies. They rarely leave me a day without some amusing anecdote.

Today, they outdid themselves.

**Ring ring**

Me: *** Servicedesk, this is dreadpirate15. 

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

We were immediately rewarded with the sound of an old register coming to a wheezy sort of life.

lawtechie,24,,24,1r39ta,,92,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away.

Tale One - Thou Shall Not Steal


Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,35,,8,1r518r,,86,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Gambatte,14,,11,1r406j,,86,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

One day a woman calls in, she says she needs help because she ""can't receive e-mails"" for several days now. I ask her the usual questions to help me understand her setup (is she using our Web Mail or Thunderbird, etc), but either she doesn't understand at all what I'm talking about, or she is being difficult on purpose.

A woman calls up and needs some remote troubleshooting done, she says her screen has gone blank. It's determined that the monitor has died after being left on 24-7 for 5 years or so, and a new one gets sent out. 

The woman is concerned about hooking it up herself. My co-worker explains to her what a VGA cable is, and that it's a big blue box and all she has to do is plug the new one into the wall with one cable and attach the new cord with the blue box on the computer.

FenrisFrost,8,,11,1r5ce7,,75,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves.

squigglechicken,5,,14,1r2dr9,,68,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.*

It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,8,1rg6w8,,67,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

I work as a Tape Backup Operator for a large banking corporation.  My job description: Sit on ass until there's a ticket submitted to either enter or eject tapes into large robotic libraries.

Today is going to be a long Monday...
Ticket initially submitted at 12:03pm EST to eject 
130 (We'll call it Series 1) tapes.  After ~30 minutes, OverseasGuy requests we return the ticket with no other explanation.  Meh, fine...whatever.  I already dragged a metal cart that holds 240 tapes upstairs and across the building to get 'em...but whatever.  So I haul the cart back downstairs to our storage area, and go back to my lunch which he so rudely interrupted.  

We receive the ticket again at 1:56pm EST changing it from 130 Series 1 tapes to 200 Series 2 tapes.  32 tapes are ejected (after telling OverseasGuy we can do 39 at a time...that's how much the door holds...for some reason this library has issues setting up a queue like the other machines, so they have to do it one door at a time).  I close the door waiting for the next set....nothing.  Multiple attempts to contact OverseasGuy were made with no response.  At 3:01pm EST, OverseasGuy comes back with ""Sorry, i was at lunch""; machine ejects 32 more (mind you, I've already instructed the operator it can eject 39 per door) tapes.  No more activity...it's now 3:22pm EST.

Edit:  It is now 4:05pm EST, the last 39 are ejecting out of the machine now!  From 12:03pm to past 4pm (I leave at 4:30...woohoo!), an operation was completed that usually takes no more than half an hour!

samurai-technician,9,,9,1r1iti,,68,"One of our salesmen, we'll call him Moron, asks me if I can handle an installation of an new VoIP recording system with an integration we are not familiar with.


Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.


""What do you prefer,"" he asks me, ""a rack-mount server or a tower server?""


This is not going to go well. ""Why don't you ask the customer what they prefer?""


""That's a good idea."" He's been a salesman with the company for the past 9 years.


Moron orders an analog recording card from the manufacturer. I gazed alternatively at the packing slip and the contents of the box, back and forth with mouth agape in disbelief.


""Moron! You ordered an analog card and analog licenses. We don't use cards for VoIP."" I figuratively exclaimed.


""You told me this is what we need for a rack server tower,"" he literally stated.

I took an intimidating battle stance. I stared at him. I locked eyes. The extended silence had no affect on his disposition. His eyes were dead.


""Did you order a rack or a tower?""


""I'm not going to order the server until the week of the install so we can maximize utilizing the warranty."" He talks like a brochure when he knows he's in trouble. Since, even when he eats lunch he's in over his head, he talks like a moron all the time.


""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in. I have no issues with dropping everything else to rush getting it configured with the OS properly installed and updated, and the new software that we have never seen or worked with before installed and configured.
If you get your timing right, I’ll take it out of the box on the day of the install. I understand that three weeks time is crucial to maximize a warranty."" I was angry. This was my best, most eloquent sarcasm.

Nothing hugely special, I don't work in tech support, just a 20 year old travelling and currently living in France sharing an apartment with a French woman.

Easy. Later that night I showed her where it was, what I'd put there, she was happy, excited almost, and we left it there.

Today I got home and she's playing around on her computer. I sit down and she says (in French, she speaks no English and I speak a little French) she can't open the music.

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up. 

After that several more times she would bring it back with the same problem only different exuses and sometimes she wouldn't even speak and i kept her privacy but it got to the point where avg no longer could do it job and I had to format and reinstall windows. Months later she donated it to the shop but never said why. Now that I think about it it had some kind of smeared residue near the track pad.. 

Thank you for reading and hoped you enjoyed it. Sorry if it got a little too boring Lola.

I work grunt level support for the uni I attend. Mostly my duties include answering phones, fixing people's moble wireless settings, and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support.  However, during the summers, some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers. New purchases are imaged, added to a domain, and have special software deployed based on where its going. Old relics leaving service  are KillDisc-ed, scavenged for parts, and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling. Its not a bad gig.


In order to maintain some degree of CYA, when computers arrive to be out-processed and recycled we keep them for 15 days before wiping them. This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine, it can still be recovered. Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience. 

Too bad that ""Most of the time"" is not "" All of the time""

This particular incident began with me arriving, caffeine in thermos, book in hand, for another day of processing. I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen, noting the paperwork. According to the paperwork, I can wipe it.  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights. ( I used to sing Daisy, Daisy while i worked, but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath, I laughed and said "" no im just grunt support"" )

I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed ""Professor. Derpingtons"" computer yet. I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me. Then, as if it were fate, I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on, lo and behold its Derpington's. 

""Not boss, I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press go""

""Well the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so don't kill it yet""

""Ok, should I get his files off for him?""

""No he says he needs them ASAP, Hes coming here to get them""

I double take, Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility. Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map.  The idea of a Bambi-eyed professor navigating our wire strewn, technological reliquary of a faculty is novel, if not terrifying. 

Soon the professor arrives, luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before. I walk him through several rooms, each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation. I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him. He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files. 

I step away for while, I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files. So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves. The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime, based on the volume of the fans. 

""Sir, are you done?"" I move to turn the monitor back on ""I can shut it down and walk you to the exit""

""NO WAIT"" he reaches out to stop me.

I reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight. The windows file transfer dialog, with its loading bar, animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive. 

Hold on.....

300GB of files are being moved.....

from a folder labeled ""NOT PORN"".......

My discovery happens in an instant, and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again. 

""that is private, Students should not be rooting through professors files!""

""yes sir, my mistake"" I begin walking out "" Give me a call when your finished"". I round the corner and keep walking, I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away, I double over and laugh for a while. eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington, Lord of Not Pornia. 

""So what happens now?"" he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine. I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data. He demands that he wants to witness the wiping, ""for security reasons"". I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was 300GB of Not porn was...""For Science"". But he stood by for 40 minutes as killdisc did its magic. 

I escorted him out and he thanked me and my boss, promising to ""put in a good word for IT because of our good work here"".  As he left, I avoided shaking his hand. 

Edit: the're in there with their bear.

Amaltron,15,,6,1r5o8x,,53,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

tl;dr He made a sandwich. The bologna went bad so he put salami on top of it thinking it will make it good again.","Too many popups, so I'll just download another browser!",59,TalesFromTechsupport

I had this phone call happen to me earlier. I work as a Help Desk/Network Specialist/Hardware/Software/Systems Admin/Network Admin/Jack of all Trades person at a small time local computer service company in my city. It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive!

McFurty: Oh! Hey there! Oh my, I'm so glad I got a hold of y'all. My computer, it isn't working! I tried holding down the button at the bottom waiting for all the lights to come off and then on again and I tried unplugging it and plugging it back on but nothing!

Prof X: I'm sorry to hear you're having issues getting you're computer to turn on, Mrs. McFurty. Let's see what we can do to get you back up and running again. I'm just gonna ask some basic questions first to get started.

McFurty: Well okay!

Prof X: Are there any lights currently on the front of the PC or is there any picture going to your monitor? 

McFurty: Prof. X is there any way you can come over today? I mean, my husband has some checks to send out and we really need the computer to work.

Prof X: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but unfortunately I already have appointments scheduled for later this afternoon at the opposite side of town, I can make you an appointment for Monday if you really want me to be there in person to troubleshoot.

McFurty: Wait! It looks like somethings happening!

Prof X: How do you mean? Could you tell me if there's anything on the screen or lights on the PC?

McFurty: YES! THERE IS! OH, PRAISE JESUS! IT LOOKS LIKE IT HEALED ITSELF WHILE I WAS AT BIBLE STUDY!

FenrisFrost,13,,2,1r678j,,53,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*."" 


I hear his Outlook notification go off just then. Found out later it was one of his best admins giving his notice, citing this policy change as his reason. ",Good timing,55,TalesFromTechsupport

frozenfoxy,1,,7,1r1o5q,,48,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,55,TalesFromTechsupport

rat_in_your_basement,27,,19,1rejzv,,46,"I'm my own stupid user in this story. This is from back when I still had a Win XP SP3 (on a 64-bit processor at that), and had zero IT experience. I'm hazy on the technical details, and have no clue how I got the virus in the first place, but here goes:

I started to run into this issue with my web browsers (except for Rockmelt, the virus wasn't compatible with Rockmelt), where clicking on links in a Google search window would cause me to be redirected to a very shady looking site full of even shadier advertisements. Like hell are there only fifteen local singles in my area. I had Malwarebytes, but after dozens of failed scans, I was able to conclude that whatever it was that made it onto my computer would cause a BSOD upon detection. Being inexperienced, I either had no clue about all of Malwarebytes' little tools to get around that, or they didn't exist back then.

One way or another, I decided to try my luck with encryption. Google (unbeknownst to most of the world) runs an [encrypted version of their search engine](https://encrypted.google.com), and I ended up relying heavily on it, as it seemed to get around the malicious software. 

A little while later, I installed [Windows Network Monitor](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=4865) and ran an unencrypted Google search. Upon doing the search, Network Monitor told me what file had accessed the internet and caused my redirect. Upon scanning it with MBAM, BSOD. No huge surprise. I considered simply deleting it, but Windows 7 had just come out, and that was just one of many issues that had accumulated on that machine over the years.

I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

Sure. I personally love helping people when they have computer problems, so sure. Why not?

Fast forward to the evening. We arrive at my aunt's house. A bit of chitchat and she informs me about the problem. Appearantly internet doesn't work. I check the modem. Everything seems fine. Ofcourse, since her iPad can connect to the internet. 
I take a look at her computer. It's a brand new HP with Windows 8.1 on it. It's not connected to a network. I as what her password it and try it. ""Incorrect password""
After a few attempts (in case I typed wrong), still nothing. 
Weird.
It's the correct network though, so I ask if she is sure about this password. 
""Yes yes ofcourse. It's weird because I can access my emails and facebook with that password on my iPad""

Then a bell rings.
Hold on, is she talking about the password of her accounts?
I take a look at the documents from the ISP and see the password for the network (something like A2388CDhuZa8...). Connect again with that password, and bam! Connected!

dennisthetiger,5,,11,1rc4hk,,38,"So it came to pass that, when I went to work for $mobile_company, I received training.

OK, no problem.  I already had a small amount of tech-savvy under my belt, was running my own Linux based web server off of a DSL connection (YAY ME!) with its own hosted DNS (ooh, l33t!), and had a fair understanding of things.  All in all, was a pretty easy job.

Well, of course, on the first day of any employ, there will be the words from the IT guy.

We had this man named Frank. Frank is a big guy.  Frank looks scary.  Frank can be mean.

He gave us The Speech.

""This is my network,"" he said.  ""There are thousands - nay, millions - like it, but this one is mine.  I run it, I am responsible for it.

""You will not modify my network.

""You will not install unauthorized software, override my firewall, or even insert a USB key drive into any computer in this network, or I will know about it. This network will notify me.

""You **will not**,"" he emphasized, ""go to Myspace^1.  I **hate** Myspace^2.  You will not release proprietary data.  If you do, I will be coming to your desk.  You DO NOT want me coming to your desk.""

Usual Q&amp;A ensues.

This, ladies and gentlemen, was my introduction into the world of information technology: a man faced the new hires and gave what I now refer to as the Speech Of Doom.  And I decided that one thing, aside from the computer maintenance and network operations and and and that comes with IT, one thing I decided I wanted to do was give that speech to the new hires some day.

I have modified my own, just in case I ever meet the day where I am allowed to give this speech.  I plan on threatening the theft of the soul of the policy violators through their pupils - in a way that is so painful, there will be no anesthetic that could ever hope to kill that pain.

And Frank?  Don't piss him off.  Nice guy, but I've seen him pissed.  Good news: it was never at me.

SkraeNocturne,8,,7,1r8y9u,,30,"So, my client has tasked me with replacing computers in the warehouse and on the production floor.  Last month, their IT/DB person quit to go to another job, and I'm still ecstatic for her (employee satisfaction at this client is almost nonexistent, it was worst for her).  We're coming up on a month and a half, and I'm only just now hearing from my boss that they're going to be hiring somebody because they were convinced that they would never need a database person again.

Back to the story, one of the computers on my replacement list is one they use for &lt;large shipping company well known for their orange and purple logo&gt; shipping, and use &lt;shipping company&gt;'s proprietary software.  All well and fine.  I'm doing my best not to have to call their tech support, even though my limited experience with them has been great.  Low wait times, quick resolution.

Right now, I'm having trouble with the database integration since I don't have any documentation on what databases are what, where do they pull info, etc.  I have been implicitly forbidden by the client from asking &lt;previous DB person&gt; what I need to do for anything around here, nor do I want to remind her of the ""system"" here.  So I ask their EDI guy, and the guy they keep around because the owner is too softhearted to let him go because he's been around here since the dawn of time, even though he doesn't technically have a job to do anymore, and hasn't for some time now (probably since the start of the information age, I would guess).  But since he has had experience with their EDI system from a decade ago, I've been told to talk to him if there's a problem.  Let's call him Dan.

I just got done speaking with him because I was out of options:

ME:  Hey, Dan, do you know what data source the shipping data is pulled from?

DAN:  That would be &lt;Access database&gt;.  *Fuck*

ME:  I'm pretty sure it needs to pull from SQL...

DAN:  No, here, let me bring up &lt;Access database&gt; and show you.

ME:  *Crap...*  Ok, but I really don't think this is what I need to do...

DAN:  No, no, here.  See these tables?  That stores the shipping info, so you need to import these three tables into &lt;shipping company software&gt;.

ME:  *trying to GTFO* Great, I think that might be what I needed.  I've got a few other things I need to take care of before I head out (at that point, in ten minutes).

DAN:  Yeah, just a minute.  So these tables talk to eachother in the &lt;Access database&gt; and have all the shipping info, and...

ay_gov,2,,4,1r5zu4,,29,"Two instances of people who should know better not knowing better...  To be fair they are contractors so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.


**Instance the First**

I receive an email request with probably 7 people involved in the email chain. AD account with local server admin rights needed for an application install.

I go through the requisite steps of setting up the account, applying the expiration date, restricting the logon to that application server, adding admin rights on that application server.  Quick and easy!

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.  Well, the person he has cc'd is tech illiterate (read: my OS is Internet Explorer) so I'm not that fussed.  Return to my coffee and indulge in some Reddit....

Until I receive yet another email.  This time it's the project coordinator from the company replying to everyone in the email chain.... with the email I sent to the tech with his account details as an attachment.  Holy hell , Batman!  Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.

I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders. 
He then ends the intervention with: ""Because I got this problem before and then a friend of mine who is really into computers told me I had to switch to Offline mode to get it fixed but now all my e-mails were gone...""

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
samurai-technician,4,,23,1r9aqc,,3,"Recent tales told here reminded me of this poignant vignette...


The winter of 1993 shimmers lithely in distant memory. My company was two groups: the artsy-fartsy liberals at the far end of the building deeply engrossed in their oh-so-important work for humanity and the technical group that made it all possible at the other end of the building.


The only technically competent individual in the artsy fartsy group was ironically the oldest, with one foot out the door and one deeply engrossed. His 'weltanschauung' was enlightening, he was always smiling--or perhaps smirking, and he drank coffee whose beans were roasted after they passed through a Lemur's ass. He was the only one of both ends of the building who had acquired a 9600 baud modem from the company at large. He knew how to work it too, boy. We didn't have to show him 'nuthin'. Our operations were on 1200 baud modems and less, and this guy gets to have his own 9600 baud modem.


He knew the AT command set and that commanded respect.


During the third shift, we, and when I say we, I mean mostly--if not only I would sit at his station--on his PC. We would dial in to the local BBS and...be part of the nascent internet. I would later have to defend my 'abuse' of the equipment and phone records of dialing into what was called...The Love Connection BBS? What I learned by doing this turned into knowledge to save the day that one time.


One day, during NBH, he reports to me a connectivity issue. He can dial up and connect, but cannot use Telix or Procomm to get any further. He demonstrates entirely from the various command lines. Probably something to do with that PPTP stuff. 


I call the local ISP...the only one channel in the galaxy...of cheap, reliable PINE and GOPHER play. He and I even had an email address from them--a real novelty. The kid at the help desk begins his script.


He had me go through all the standard stuff--turning this and that off, typing this and this command, even reloading DOS, and after about twenty minutes finally admits that they are experiencing problems and this is most likely related.

arawra184,3,,11,1re3xk,,0,"I am Level .5 support, working for a company that is outsourced from major ISPs. I help customers (CX's, as we refer to them) get devices connected to their network, diagnose DNS issues, replace faulty modems/gateways, and SOME limited browser config as well as test for ISP-given email account issues.

I get a call from a CX who is streaming netflix from his phone to his TV. He says its a poor connection and wants me to diagnose. I didn't quite pick up on it at first, so I reiterate:

**Me:** ""Are you trying to watch Netflix on your phone and tv?""

**CX:** ""No, I am streaming Netflix from my phone to the TV.""

**Me:** ""That service is going through your phones connection, not &lt;ISP&gt;'s, so its not something I am going to be able to help you with.""

**CX:** ""But all my devices are connected through my home wifi, and my phone is too. Isn't there a signal or something you can send to my router?""

**Me:** ""The phone doesn't share the connection between the home wifi and your TV. It is running PURELY through your phone's connection.""

CX refuses to listen to how technology works and I'm stuck trying to explain it.",Isn't there a signal that you can send to the router?,2,TalesFromTechsupport
