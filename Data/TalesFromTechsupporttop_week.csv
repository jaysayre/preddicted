Techsupportvictim,237,646,1r5j3f,1649,Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution The scene My retail that also does tech support for our stuff store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know he had set up man vows never to lie to wife again My job is done ,Never lie to your wife,2295
FredFltStn,299,593,1qz6qm,1344,About a year ago the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone s as their company phone Since the Blackberrys that we had previously carried were an older model with few features most of the managers were happy with the switchAlthough the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities some of the people in the office went a little crazy downloading apps and music onto the phone The phones would sync calendars email and the like over the air and didnt need to be connected to a PC Of course many people used their desktop PCs to charge their phone during the day plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone No big deal you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped upOne of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation and asked me to help out Shes not in IT and her computer skills are mediocre at best I sat down at her desk and went through the presentation with her with me driving and her sitting by my side walking me through what she wantedWe came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph so I clicked InsertPicture from the menuApparently the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC More importantly she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies which were now gloriously displayed in extralarge icons across her  monitor I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at ok maybe a few seconds longer than that and she immediately turned  shades of red I blew it off like it was no big deal saved the presentation and told her we could work on it later I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to earThanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Got to know my female coworker a little better,1937

FredFltStn,165,395,1r22gy,1172,A few years ago I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop The app was actually written is basic if that tells you anything As you can imagine support was a bitchWe had a user that was having a strange issue with printing Every time he tried to print something from my application  copies came out of the printer This only happened when printing from my app When printing from Microsoft office everything was fine and dandy  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolutionThe guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC The PC had been recently refreshed so when the desktop support team couldnt figure out the issue they passed the ticket back to hardware and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time No luck on a fix and the ticket was passed back to Desktop supportActually the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times but had been unable to resolve the issue and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks It finally made it to my queue leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wakeI visited the user onsite and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on As the ticket said he could print fine from all of the other apps but printing a single page from my app resulted in  copies He must have had  sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copiesMy app actually printed through the LPT port I checked the setup and everything seemed fine The app was designed to send directly to the printer and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app so I knew that couldnt be the problem I checked the printer and it seemed normal I was seriously stumped and had tried just about everything I could think of Out of options I started playing with the printer again and going through the various menus It had been a long time since Id messed with one of the older LaserJets After about  minutes I blundered across the issue In one of the menus his printer had been manually set for  copies The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting so they would always print the selected number of copies My app just sent the basic info to the printer so the printer used the build in print menu when printingWe had easily spent more than  man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing not to mention a case of paper Modern tech at its finest Thanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Thousands of dollars and dozens on man hours trying to fix a printing issue,1567
jaydude,157,300,1qw7lx,862,My partners brother is a complete moronI fixed a computer that was crashing and rebooting all the time by switching out the power supply with my old one and replaced the ram while I was at it I also changed the thermal paste on the cpu as the pc had not been used in years and was all dried up After about  hours of switching out parts and reinstalling windows and software I finally get the pc running normally again with no problemsNow this is where the dipshit and his almighty knowledge of the gods comes inHe is convinced that because I fixed it it must still be broken because it was not him who fixed it he takes my ram out and replaces it with new ram he just bought and the computer starts crashing with blue screens again  DAYS he is trying to fix that computer because he is convinced that the ram he JUST brought is not the problem despite the fact that is was working perfectly before he fucking changed itAnd so he finally buys new ram And now cannot seem to install windows from a usb absolutely refusing my help he spends the next full day staring at a blank screen like he is going to fix it using only the power of his mindNow it has been a few months since all this happened and it is working again but only now has he realized that my power supply in still in there and he has brought a new one he is also going to remove all my thermal paste and replace that toNow here is the good bit I replaced the wifi card in it with a mbps one it only had a mbps card in it and now he thinks the new wifi card is too powerful for the computer and it is going to short it out and blow upAnd this is what I have to live with for the next several monthsPS It is not his computer its the pc in the lounge room I fixed it so my partner could use itEdit He reinstalled windows because I installed my copy on there and not hisEdit Edit I am male my partner Fiancée is female haha Originally posted by me on rhardwareFor those asking this is their mothers house we got booted from our last place so the owners could renovate we getting a new place this weekSo yes he is  years old and still living with mummy,Partners brother is an idiot,1162

tuxedojack,105,237,1qyen5,778,Sometimes its just too easy              Tuxedo Jack and Craptacularly Spignificant Productions                                present             Kids GPS Tracking and Singularly Stupid Decisions    When it rains it pours I grumbled sipping at a dripbrewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and tasteGiven the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurigbrewed coffee Id prised open ten Kcups of Dark Magic to fill a doublefilter of coffee which I then brewed up The weather in Austin had started to get cool again after a weekend that was an alltoounpleasant reminder of the ballscorcher that was summer and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets On top of everything my secondnewest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty so it fell to me to get things done in his steadNever send a PFY to do a network admins job I continued sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet as is my wont and my cell phone burst into Rick Astleys dulcet tones signifying an incoming call I arched an eyebrow  I hadnt expected the campus tech to call me not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on A quick flick of the screen later and my Ones speakers blasted his voice out into the officeHey Jack weve got a problem here he said frustration evident in his voiceIs it NEWPFY I took a sip Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXASCOLLEGE in my contact listI could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it No he didnt do anything He knows better Ive got something new for youHe detailed the situation leaving nothing out  apparently a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to offcampus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant and in his brilliance when he ran into the restaurant he left his tablet and phone on the front seat and the car unlockedThe imbecile also left his keys in the cupholderYou can guess where this is goingTen minutes later when he came out with his order his gadgets were gone and so was his nice new carHe got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did and the administration was in an uproar I shrugged A car stolen Whoopdyshit thats why we have insurance itd be covered The tablet Not so much A police report had already been filed and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them and if it was at all possible to try to save the carIts the principle of the thing I thought to myself as I plugged the kids credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode A few clicks later the police report number was registered with Computrace and the tablet flagged as stolen Such useful tools but only in the right hands I smirked Of course it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misusedAbout twenty minutes later the device stopped moving ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic I took a look at the final location Something seemed off about it I grabbed the nearest crossstreets and plugged it into Google Maps then switched to Satellite View My eyebrows went up at what I saw and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys I drained my coffee then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door I had a drive to make    A SHORT WHILE LATER     I walked into the school phone and bag of fast food  from a rather popular nearby restaurant in hand and strolled into the campus techs officeWhatre you doing here he asked Didnt you track the phone and tabletI nodded and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone followed by the bag of food His eyes widenedYouve got to be jokingI shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before not entirely coincidentally taken outside a rather popular nearby restaurant and he started chucklingI pity him I could sense the laughter rising in him and he stood up and locked his machine The kids in the office he said and walked out of his office with me following I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY who was sitting in the corner stripping down machines for parts in his free periodSure enough the kid was in the office and his father was there too as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in handDid you find my phone the kid said jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech franticallyForget the phone his father said Wheres the carIm honestly surprised he doesnt know I replied Given what he did he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet  and yes his car too  wentWhat are you talking about the dad said his expression blanker than a new chalkboardDoes this look familiar I said turning my phone around to face the teenager and the fatherI went to lunch there today thats where my car got stolen the kid retorted So whatDoes THIS look familiar I repeated flipping to the next picture in the sequence the one Id shown the tech                            TOWING ENFORCED    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATORS EXPENSEHis reply much like his actions which kicked this off was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense I only parked there for like ten minutesAnd thats all they needed to take the car I replied flipping over to the phones last location in Google Maps which when looked at via satellite view was the towing companys storage lot As of ten minutes ago your phone was there and I daresay youll find the tablet and keys there tooHis father glared at himThe cop glared at himHe glared at meI breathed on my fingernails then buffed them on my buttondown So phone found tablet found car found universe saved crisis averted But just in case  next time park in the appropriate areas    Yet more goodness lies

lawtechie,45,135,1qts9b,676,My first tech support gig was at an advertising agency Mad Men it was not For some reason the office park had unreliable power wed have  minute shutdowns at least weekly Ironically we were less than a mile from the headquarters for the regional power company So to fix our intermittent power problems we put an UPS in every cubicle The artists got these serious  lb systems since they had  CRTs Regular users had some APC brick about the size of a shoebox One of my endusers a female account executive sends in a ticketAE Every time I have a presentation due my PC shuts down randomly Can someone please fix my broken PCSo I look at her machine Nothings obviously wrong with the PC or the UPS I open her presentation on my PC Its not corrupt or infected No infections on her PC All the cables under her desk are tight and velcrotied so theres no way shes inadvertently yanking power Since we were slow with replacing batteries in the UPS I suspect a weak battery I swap out her UPS and close the ticketA week later another ticket from AEAE Please please fix my PC I had another presentation due today and it just powered offSo I run up Her manager and my manager are trying to figure out how incompetent lazy and stupid I am I absolutely cant replicate the problem Shes convinced her PC senses that shes got last minute work to do and it hates her Her PC only shuts down when shes got a presentation on that day Im stumped but swap out everything her PC monitor keyboard and UPS and make a note of it on the ticket Ill check back with her dailyTwo days later she calls me Its done it again I tell her not to do anything and Ill be right upShes furious I cant let this one go so I ask her to go back to what she was doing I finally figure it out and start laughing I ask her if she only wears high heels on presentation days She does I point out that she uses the UPS as a foot rest When shes barefoot or wearing flats the plastic ridges on the side of the onoff rocker switch on the UPS prevent the switch from being hit When shes wearing heels the heel is narrower than the switch and protectors allowing her to hit the off switch long enough to power down the system The spring tension in the switch moves it back into ON position by the time anyone comes back to investigateShe starts laughing herself I make a cardboard cover for the switch and she goes back to work,Your shoes are causing your PC to shut down Maam,811

sharpie,60,161,1qqw7h,447,So I was talking about my student loans in rexplainlikeimfive and I briefly brought up my first work experience  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion unrelated but how fukkin cool would that beI started the job as a Security Intern which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions but also meant I got to do audits of the University  It was unpaid but it was relevant work experience that I knew I would desperately need  This was fine because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games  Some of them had Autodesk  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth  During that time there I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them  If one went dark I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware relatedThis was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the Security Technician essentially my boss and getting paid was quitting  He hadnt graduated yet but had a better job lined up  Guess who got the bump up  This guy  hour to do the same shit I was already doing  FuckyeahSeaking  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth  I could pretty much make up my own hours  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin down  I wasnt building the images or doing the complex stuff but the IT Archwizards were glad I was there  I allowed them to focus  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paidAll great things do eventually go sour though  And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet  I walked in another day and there was something wrong  It wasnt the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server  It was different  You could smell it in the air  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin  I own that name OldSpice fuck you  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin who was my boss now was changing his grades  Now you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin  Well because thats how you do it when youre a diploma mill  Who can you pay less than one of the students youre supposed to be educating  Well anyways he didnt deny it and he couldve got away with it if he hadnt become too greedy  But alas guess who got bumped up again  Not this guy actually  No one did  Which was okay because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything wed need for at least a little while  So life went on with one less friend because he left mid semester and never actually graduatedNows the best time to tell you about the IT Staff  There was J who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than Ill ever know  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasnt a foreign national  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells  Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system  Finally there was M  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled   But thats all you ask  Yes these  guys managed a University of too many  They did it alone  They did it entirely without thanks  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much but they believed they were making it a better place  They thought that if they werent there then who would protect the neckbeards  Certainly not their parents  They paid for them to be here  To get them out of their basement  There was also the IT Manager R  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew  He had a lot of other roles to fill but he trusted J S M and I and so we were largely unmanaged  It was how we survived and it was how the school survivedOne day sitting with us in our circle of chairs R just slammed his fist down stood up and said I dont usually do this but unless any of you object Id like to bring Sharpie on full time  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life  By the end of the day there was a contract on my seat  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit  I was sad but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life  kyear  FYI happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together  They are not peanut butter and jelly  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste but not jellyShortly after him S amp J quit as well  Im pretty sure R knew they would quit too but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing  I dont remember who had a job lined up first but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together  This was mostly because of politics but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone with thousands of students and staff depending on them  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it  Sick of not being paid enough I found out later they made kyear each there  Both had put in  years at least never a raise or vacation  Sick of the disrespect  wed have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair  We would have to drop everything no matter how serious and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot  There were also days once a month where wed be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned  As a footnote  If theyd known that one day a few years into the future theyd be lined up literally and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered Im sure they wouldve done things different  But anyways  I couldnt get fired because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure the network and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty  So at least we had that going for us which was niceThings really started going down hill close to Christmas time though thats when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP  Windows  was coming out and our image which I didnt know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it because of the servers because of the network  I made the decision to drop Ghost mostly because I hated Symantec but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M tokens supported  Keep in mind I didnt know dick about doing this  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in  months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows  environment  But also in that time I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hogWhy was the Windows  shitty  Well partly because I was still learning partly because we were using roaming profiles and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images discovering if you didnt set the skipRearm flag before you sysprepd an image  times you irreversibly fucked your image  Seriously when Windows  first came out that was pretty much undocumented  I remember when it started getting cold  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty  I remember it reaching  in there and I sent M a text saying Hey man  Im freezing in here  I have a jacket but Im still really cold my feet are numb  Can you call maintenance I cant find their number  He sent me back lol  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happenSo can you imagine being  being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before  computers starting to image them all and knowing just fukkin knowing that if this didnt work that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but everyones day  Youll never guess what didnt work  Spoiler  Pretty much everything  It took  hours to image  systems of the thousand we had because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network each one was being handled unicast creating its own link to the server creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file  I felt really fuckin clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit  But never the less shit did not work  Shit did not work for a long time  At first it was that no one could log in  I fixed that it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile theyd pull based on what the system was supposed to be  Then it was all of the undocumented bandaids that had been wiped away in XP  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start gt Fucking Computer because they were Babyboomers and change scared them  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldnt use Windows   I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition  Which believe me can be a lot if youre not up for figuring it out yourself  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground an undocumented network and server infrastructure and updates that had to be done manually  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons because it wasnt worth the drive homeShit was still fucked up around Valentines day  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though  They fucking should have though  I would have if I wasnt me  They didnt give a shit though  They could still play video games and thats all they ever needed  Valentines day was important to me because the staff and faculty fuckin rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick  For the record popcorn comes in  sizes Small Medium Large My Dick  You get the idea  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands  One pissed off day a few months later I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig  She found out and sewed that shit back together  I wish Id taken that pig when I leftThings eventually settled down though  I persisted overcame and continued to do the best I could  They were worried about the security of the systems and they fuckin shouldve been so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him who Ill call D M and Sharpie  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real stridesThen one day they hired a new IT Manager  That was pretty much when things started going down hill  I couldve survived and probably wouldve stayed there a lot longer if they hadnt brought this guy on  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being  And so he did  This guy gobbled the Presidents balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy  Anything the President wanted this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience  None at all  Guy didnt know dick about management so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos  He ruined that shit for me  Not that I liked it that much but I went from Meh to unconditionally hating that shit  Hed talk about wanting to bang her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice which was his real voice  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid  A kid that looked like a Naird chimp by the way  Eventually they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I wont go into detail about  Guy didnt know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable which was fine but the guy was making more than twice my wagesNeedless to say shit got pretty tense in there  M D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didnt like it  Of course they let go of the guy they could to make a point  They shit canned M  I was furious but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present  Universally up until the new IT Manager we were all huge gun enthusiasts M especially  He found zen in the long distance shot  He owned a rifle that Ive long since forgotten but was chambered in  Winchester Magnum  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his goingaway present  The opportunity to shoot a grill size full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin nowhereSo of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning  Got there at AM had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there it was still pitch black  Stars look different when theres no light pollution to fuck with your night view  EDIT   So anyways were out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and hes stoked and Im stoked and I walk it about  yards out to the side of a giant hill  You dont know terror until youre out in the wilderness  yards away from the only light which is a trucks low beams  Theres just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out  But anyways I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didnt want to get eaten by a bobcat or something  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back  Terrified  I get back there and Ms like  dude whered you put it  I look back and its too fuckin dark to see it  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and theres a glowstick in there  I walk out tie that shit on and finally get back  Ms already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab  What felt like an hour was probably  seconds as M zeroed in prone and took his shot  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death  At first you could see it spin because of the light but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off Thats when for the second time that night I discovered what terror really isIt sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to takeoff speed but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably  or  feet to the right from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again  It did this two more times toward us during which I truly thought it was intentional but finally died down  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned I looked down and M was still prone  Hed never moved  He just in the epitome of alpha male badassery said cool  We both walked out to get it partly because you dont leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up but also because he wanted to show his  year old daughter  He said she loved this kind of stuff  We shot some targets after that then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind  That was the last time I actually saw the guy,Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired,608

the door and mind the gap    The year was  Clinton was gearing up for his reelection campaign the Bojinka Plot was exposed due to a chemical fire the Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated and the Tokyo subway was attacked with sarin gas by Aum ShinrikyoHowever as these are irrelevant to our story well skip that and go straight to Houston Texas where an elevenyearold fifth grader was headed to school with a rather hefty book in his backpack one that most people his age wouldnt even begin to comprehend let alone bother to pick up He looked forward to the day of schoolwork despite being bullied by his peers for being different and nerdy and the many Macintosh computers at his school were an escape for him System  had been released the semester before and it had been installed across nearly every machine at the schoolNumber Munchers Oregon Trail Carmen Sandiego OutNumbered and Treasure MathStorm Games all morning he thought to himself as he walked in the schools front door and headed to his classroom He picked up the copy of the Houston Chronicle that had been delivered to the school that day  to a classroom  some educational program paid for it took out the front local business and lifestyle sections then snuck down the hall to the teachers loungeTechnically he wasnt supposed to be in there However when it was the only room to get even halfway decent coffeeWell a detention would be worth itHe retrieved a styrofoam cup of coffee headed for the doorHe almost made itWhat did I tell you about coffee The computer teacher chuckled as she came through the door and took the boys coffee his disaffected grumbling not stopping her as she ruffled his hair Youll stunt your growthAw come on please the boy replied looking up at the woman with innocent doe eyes It just tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papersI thought I told you last week she replied with a smile Dont be in such a hurry to grow up Youll get there eventually and youll always wish youd spent more time as a kidThe kids are stupid he grumbled They dont know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail They dont know how to catch Carmen They keep asking me how to use the Fodors guide They cant even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zappedThe teacher knelt Not all kids are like you you know Some are lucky some arent quite as lucky Either way dont complain Just help them if they get stuckFine Ms D he muttered Can I PLEASE have my coffee I have stocks to checkShe shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage I dont want to know just why youre doing thatHe scampered off coffee and newspaper in hand    LATER THAT DAY    After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment the boy was tired of it He went into his sanctuary the computer lab and sat down at one of the Macs then started a game of Number MunchersA pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard causing him to look up in annoyance Hey Cut it outThe boys malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard causing the Troggle to eat his MuncherWhatd you do that forYoure stupid the girl sneered at him Youre a nerd and we all hate you Go back to the school you were at beforeQuiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him but before he could say something or do something the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulderAhem You know youre not supposed to say things like that rightSorry the girl apologzed quite insincerelyGet to your lunch break Youre not allowed in here right now If I catch you acting like that again you dont get to play games in here for a monthAfter the girl walked out the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed Look theyre going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourselfI know he muttered quietly I just dont know what to doJust dont hit her Its not nice and boys dont hit girls The teacher walked off and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started readingMacworld Macintosh Secretshttpimgurcomdie    THAT EVENING    The boy was in heavenHis mother worked for the county teaching ESL English as a Second Language to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights and sometimes if his father was working late his mother would bring him and his sister along with her but she left them with the childcare crew which a lot of the time took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in itAfter a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego the boy returned to reading his massive tome and an idea struck him one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentorFortunately there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening and the machine he went to was unoccupiedAfter a few quick looks around he slipped a floppy disk into the drive and opened up a single program on it He flipped through pages in the book occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger clicking and typing the whole way performing a veritable ritual on the machine one with an unclear finishAn hour later he ejected the disk shut the machine down and went back to his bookWhen his mother took him and his sister home he felt a deep satisfaction knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period    THE NEXT DAY    Okay kids the teacher called out loudly Go to your assigned computers sit down turn it on and get ready Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skillsThe boy went to his machine complied with the teachers request and began playing A short while later the bully raised her voiceMs D The computer isnt workingThe teacher got up and went over doubleclicked Macintosh HD and the Trash Can opened She closed it reopened it and the same thing occurred She opened the Trash and Mac HD opened with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documentsHuh Well Ill have to fix this Itll take a while She looked around and there were no machines free Well theres no computers available so youre going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math SorryThe boy smiled to himself at his workstation and when the class went to its next period lunch he went over to the teacher whod had no time at all to work on the machineUm Ms D Can I help you fix the computerShe shook her head I dont think so This isnt something someone like you would know how to fixI think I kind of do know how to fix it Ms D Can I at least try pleaseShe shrugged and gestured to the machine Be my guestTwenty minutes passed and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while The teacher had stopped what she was working on and went over to watch the boy at workSo someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon She stroked her chin And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can then renamed them to each otherI think thats what happened the boy said a huge grin on his faceShe smirked and tousled his hair And I suppose that thats going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroomI dont think so Ms D the boy replied quietly I only think Im going to do it if she picks on me again He looked up in alarm at his faux pas I mean um I just told on myself didnt IThe teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his earTold on yourself for whatThe boy looked up and a smile was on his faceCome on I think Ive got a few things to teach you the teacher said beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer rooms storage room I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here and I think youre the right kid to do it Jack    More modern things tickle your fancy Try

Shadowlady,27,56,1r046v,278,First of Im not sure if this is the right sub as its not your typical Tale from Tech support its more shocking than funny but I need to share it Also I wouldnt mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similarBackstory I do outsourced tier  IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter Lets call the user DaveDave had been chasing this already calling repeatedly and stressing our level  out I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately calm him down by letting him know Im on it That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with  updates to find all the relevant bits of information That didnt work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates So instead I caught Daves wife a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop I sheepishly apologized explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket so I thanked her for her help told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didnt work I would call her back The number worked but Dave was not picking up I left a Voice mail and went to work Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully I tried to call Dave again but still no answer It was nearing the end of the work day and I didnt want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something thinking his issue was not resolved yet So I called Daves wife to tell her that just in case he calls her let him know he can go home the issue is resolved Then Daves wife drops this on me there has been a major explosion at the gas refinery Dave works at  people were killed and another is missing She hasnt been able to reach Dave either I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what were speaking about They dont speak Dutch so they cant understandDave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife Im completely stunned I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and thats why he didnt reply The moment I hang up I get a message from first line Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me He just wants to know if his laptop is workingThe only proof I can provide httpukreuterscomarticleuktotalexplosionidUKBREAIPPhttponlinewsjcomnewsarticlesSBEdit added reuters link because wsj has a paywall,I just had the biggest scare of my career and I need to vent,334
squigglechicken,72,48,1r2ucm,267,A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university In addition to the standard IT tasks AD management printer maintenance Outlook setup etc we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devicesThe crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR Nuclear Magnetic Resonance machine In essence the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough  Kelvin  Farenheit to superconduct and generate a very strong stable magnetic field A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field This can be used for example to see if a professors chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule It was a pretty awesome machine and cost a few hundred thousand dollarsWhen we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university He brought a gaggle of PhD students a lot of grant money and tons research equipment with him including a brand new NMR The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused saying No thanks my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do Fair enough well leave it to themFlash forward a couple weeks later The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR which was being tested that morning quenching  the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithfullike geyser The cause one of those experienced grad students had connected the NMRs computer to an old STEEL CASED power strip As soon as the magnets were powered up the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheatTLDR  Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from  in repairs,Magnets THATS how they work,315

everydaylinuxuser,39,43,1qwdc4,240,The year was  and I was a fresh faced student straight out of college into a large software houseI was assigned to the London office to write Unit Trust software for investment banks but as they werent ready for me yet I was placed in the IT department where for three weeks I would be imaging PCs and swapping out faulty network cardsThere were  of us new recruits in total each fresh from office supplies carrying boxes full of stationery including paper clips pads pens scissors postits and a staplerThe head of IT went through our instructions and told us about fire safety and the usual things you are told in an induction During the induction I decided to play with the stapler including loading it and then testing it on my thumb As a staple went it to my thumb I didnt make a noise because I didnt want to disturb the guy who was speaking but he had seen it He also watched in dumbfounded silence as one of his new recruits spent the next few minutes removing the staple buried deep into his skinBlood was spurting from the wound and to disguise the fact that I was in pain and that anything was happening at all out of the ordinary I put the thumb into my mouth to stem the blood flow Now the bemused manager was facing a guy who had performed an act of self harm sucking his thumb like a small child who had just been sent to the naughty spotAnd the final nail into the coffin was when I decided the blood had not stopped flowing and so I decided to wrap it in a screen wipe full of chemicals,st day in paid employment,283
SirEDCaLot,53,41,1r4i39,230,This takes place several years ago  Id just been hired by a small independent IT firm  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses and we helped out a few home users as well it wasnt something we advertised but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems and we were happy to oblige  We werent cheap but we took pride in giving everybody even the dumb ones service with a smile and our customers were generally quite happyIm a brand new hire only been there a day or so  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers and a shiny new neverbeforeused phone extension has been assigned to me  Its also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or anotherSo my phone rings the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasnt from a queue this caller punched my extension directly  The caller is a middleaged sounding womanMe This is EDC first name how can I help youCaller  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot first and last name at company  she knows my name and extensionMe  Yes it is  What can I do for you todayCaller  Well Im having a problem with my Apple Silver computer its probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card impossible my cards didnt exist yet and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thingMe  Absolutely Id be happy to help you out  Do you or your company have an account with usCaller  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer hes very smart you see but now hes in the Navy so he isnt around to fix my computer anymore can you help meMe  Id be happy to help but first we have to set up an account for you  Can I get your first and last nameCaller  Thank you  My name is firstname and I really dont know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers hes very good with themMe  That sounds very exciting  What is your street addressCaller  Oh I live just off mainroad near the WalMart its a nice neighborhood but its just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway minutes of this go by during which I hear all about this womans son but despite many attempts still havent gotten past the name and address area of the New Account pageCaller  blah blah blahSo I really dont know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and hes on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library remember she has a Mac and Im almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire meMe face firmly planted on desk    uhhh  thats not really my department  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computerCaller  Well my son used to fix my computer but now hes in the Navy so he cant fix my computer for me facepalm but Ive been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book apparently the right book for working on Macs who knew every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you doMe  Um Im not really the one to talk to for that if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé   meanwhile furiously typing out an allcaps IM to my boss  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxxxxxxxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THISCaller  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I dont want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computerMe  Well you should make sure your potroast doesnt burn then  Why dont you give us a call back when you have your resumé readyCaller  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potrclick  she hung up not meFINALLY  minutes later am holding a nowdisconnected phone staring at a New Account screen with nothing but a first nameEpilogue  Boss wasnt too impressed with my IM ignoring customers  bad but seemed to understand my explanation  We both felt bad for the woman but theres not much we could do to help we couldnt afford to sit on the phone for hoursThe woman called back two weeks later seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone her first cell phone ever  The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a severalminutelong voicemail  I forwarded it to the boss who after listening for  seconds called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment hehWe never did figure out how she got my name or extensionTLDR The Navy offers many exciting careers,How the hell did you get my extension,271

effingWitchDoctor,43,37,1r6dl6,193,Hello again TFTS Todays story takes place about  years ago at a small software company  people you probably havent heard of I was the network admin and did some inhouse scripting when I had time we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems This particular day we had one of those problemsWe had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing We were about  done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quickerJava is not a fast language Its great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them The powers that be bosses decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer VP who happened to start work on this very dayVP claimed to have  years of experience developing C He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prizeSo on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door EWD we just got a ticket from VP Apparently he cant access the development serverHuh I set him up and tested his account on Friday Forward it and Ill take a lookA few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and Im a little surprised It reads something to the amount ofi dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do hereIm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see whats amiss After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems I email him explain that Im the admin and ask if he can give me more information about the problem I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go A few minutes later I get the next emailhaha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss BB and have HIM fix this shitNow Im starting to get a little annoyed I email him back that Ill be over soon and deliberately waste  minutes looking at pictures of cats Feeling calmer I set off to figure out whats wrong only to find him about  feet away standing at the door to the server room Our server room like any server room should be is locked and airconditioned It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users Only the Head Techie HT the bosses and I have keys to this room anyone else must access it remotely Some use terminal editors directly into the server some pushpull with git all are welcome to use ftp but none are allowed in the roomI walk over to VP to explain this but as soon as he realizes who I am he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voiceIve been standing outside this door for  fucking minutes I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck inThe guy is practically shouting in my face Im shocked but quickly recover VP we dont go in there except for maintenance You can access it remotely using vim or git but no oneI DONT GIVE A SHIT IVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASSBy this point people have come out of their offices to see whats going on BB appears on scene and tells me to take  and let him sort it out I hear him calming VP as I walk offAt this point Im pissed It takes a lot to piss me off but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth After about a minute My Boss MB walks in and closes the door He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless so I just throw it out there years my ass How could someone develop for  years and not know how to edit code remotely What are they even doing over at otherCompanyI dont know I also dont know what BB is going to do about it That fella sure has a temperWe talk for a few minutes and theres a knock at the door BB VP and HT walk in VP has the most loathesome smirk Ive ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier BB looks as happy and clueless as everBB Ooooookay then Now that were all fine and dandy lets talk There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but theyre really easy fixes and heres what were going to do Were going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server VP also wants more monitors so were also gonna put a video card in it too EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because its his workstation And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind usBB is beaming MB and HT both look numb and I probably do too VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand Nothing personal buddyBB Great If anyone needs me Ill be in my officeBB and VP head out leaving HT MB and I doing our best someoneshotmydog faces We discuss it agree its ridiculous and they eventually leave to go carry it out I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new jobtldr we gave a new employee the wrong workstation and he was understandably upset,The day I realized I was going to quit my last job Warning Language,230

inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number Check Get gloves from the back room Check I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fineSo I plug this smelly POS into our test unit turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction There other people in the store minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed so it was like Whack a mole on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it Honestly we didnt get them all Now knowing what a roach box is my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we dont want to Mr T See yall sold me a roachbox Manager Do you by chance have a problem with roaMr T MOTHERFCKER ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE MY HOUSE IS NEW THERE AINT NO ROACHESI pretty much take the back seat on this one I really dont have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed locked in our back room and our store was the newest in the area There were no roaches in the storewell before the xbox was brought back there wasnt at atleastSo hes getting more and more pissed Its getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situationlike everyone left the store at this point cause Mr T was gonna explode at any second I explain the situation to the district manager who says we cant take it back I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of salescustomers he is causing He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard he district manager started the customer is always right bullshitMy manager couldnt afford to lose his jobcareer as he put years into getting a store  I was about to quit and go to college fulltime so I decided to just return the console under my name still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy etc In the space where you say why I wrote ROACHBOX  Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went We made it clear to Mr T that it was user error and we fixed his fucking error The customer is not always right Get your house sprayed for bugs or dont live like a hoarder I never got contacted about the  shrink There are various reasons why they let it go but thats a story on its ownWe replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times it was just clear enough to lip read the customer Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that TLDR  Roachbox  Enough said,Roachbox ,203
Tomagathericon,18,27,1quk95,146,Bear with me please because this needs some backstory  Some time ago i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women They had only one tech guy and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed so most of the less important stuff just got ignored Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long Word got around i made work easier for people and soon i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy    So one day one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long  Now to explain this all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS Large Document Managing System with different lists for each dayIn order to create a transfer history for a customer these were usually created and billed per month youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually as each day was a seperate list  Now youd think they would just copy what they need paste it in a textfile then print that file when they have everything Nope that would be too easy  Instead what they did was print every single transfer one by one each on a new page then get an empty piece of paper cut out all the transfers they printed this is the part where the shears come into play glue them on the empty page wait for it to dry then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way    I tried to show them the magics of copy amp paste and while they did notice it going much faster and easier the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods I believe they are still doing it this way    tldr Welcome to the handicraft class Today were gonna make a nice collage out of your parents bank transfers,How to merge two documents without the need for shears,173

RoninSpartan,17,29,1r251v,112,So have I got a tale for you One that has just happened fairly recently A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accusedA little background first though I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a workstudy picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had The offer to take on this position was made because of the server crashing of course the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures and them having  other IT personnel  of whom were under utilized but one ridiculously overpowered network adminThroughout this year after my hire I was able to implement a backup scheme with twotiers attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website learn about Server  to prepare the network to shift from a NovellGroupwise environment to a Windows NetworkingExchange environment and do most if not all of the grunt work of a workstudyThe storyNow because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services However there was one I had acquired administrative access to in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys Shortstuff leaving for another department within the college He had been dealing with the network admin for about  years and just got totally sick of it This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms events and such This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule sometimes it would get too busy to check or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didnt want to see it last minuteSo I read the manual about two months ago shortly after obtaining admin access and found out how to create IT work order notifications tested with one of the other users that book events for the college Success Now we and by we I mean I didnt have to manual check for work orders we were alerted at least  days in advance It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out although no one had mentioned it until last weekI had tried to figure out what could have happened I know I hadnt deleted anything and only added in that notification rule for IT I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldnt find where they might have been since I didnt see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules It puzzled me so I asked Shortstuff what could be going on he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset Ha well I didnt have access so I asked the network admin to look into it He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped I started to think what the hell could have happenedThe IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule or if I might have done something to that system I told him No I didnt delete anything I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert Come to find out yesterday the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime The IT director later that morning had walked into my office because of a FilePrint Server Cluster I was tasked to create I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else I was pissed I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything I looked at my IT director and was shocked So even though I didnt do anything I get my admin access taken away He just replied with Oh and stepped outIt was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry Shortstuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well he said to check the text he had just sent I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well In the huff and puff state the network admin was in without any notice or proper authorization took both my access and Shortstuffs administrative access from that systemWe decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didnt lose their administrative access This was directed toward us that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone elseMe and Shortstuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway when comes along Ladyblonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal She asked about what had happened and we let her know Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization and she uttered I think I might have done that She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought by removing those notification rules she was only removing herself from them I had an intense moment of joy and confidence for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all This was the last straw for Shortstuff and he is going to use it on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years to take down the network admin Later that evening just before I left to head home I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster He then mentioned about us not being at fault but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help Ladyblonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake without us telling her to We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his not just this one but many assumptions and wrongful accusationsWill keep you all informed of the result  Update I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such She has just recently started working here a few months back Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong he gave her a call She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending He stated about me He doesnt know what he is doing He went in the system and screwed something upUpdate  So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with He replied with This has happened in the past to Shortstuff before and I had talked with GODOFIT about it previously It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACEShortstuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GODOFIT will be on the Presidents desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw Shortstuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend  Shortstuff put up with GODOFITs shit for  years I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience We are supposed to have that meeting shortly this will definitely be a point that is brought uptldr strip my admin access and wrongfully accuse me youre going down mofo Edit they hired me cause they needed another IT guy to find out how to back shit up after their server had crashed ,An abuse of power led by a wrongful accusation,141

Zehnpae,17,15,1r05kc,90,I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician  Going into businesses and peoples homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is  You just cant explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of seminude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PCAs with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder Is this job really worth itIve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goesI spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech This was back in late s earlynaughties doubles when it was still a bit of an oddity  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster cheaper and without them having to leave the house  It was no contestMy schedule got busy pretty quick I would get asked for by name more often than not  I had adventures every day was an adventure  I collected stories like pokemon  Stories of delight terror and everything between  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story  The one that haunts you in your waking dreamsI pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon  Id worked that trailer park before  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad  This particular trailer had the mandatory  plastic lawn chairs area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns  Nothing out of the ordinaryI checked my collar knocked on the door and waited  After a few moments your standard old lady lets call her Betsy answered the door  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed Oh youre that geek guy Come on inI took a step inside the door felt a crunch took another step felt another crunch  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked onKitty litterI glanced around and found that it was everywhere  I couldnt actually see the floor itself  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big nope but I was too much the professional  I asked her where the computer wasBetsy smiled either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasnt some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where shed chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter not settling on top of itShe led me down a short corridor crunch crunch crunch crunch  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter crunch crunch crunch  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer a relic of a long gone era  She offered no explanation almost no awareness of it being there  I didnt have the wherewithal to ask  Ive seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanationShe gestured at the computer explained that as of a few days ago it wont turn on anymore  I knelt downyeahI knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button  Standard PC repair operations right  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about  or  inches deepThe power checked out I could charge my phone  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable  No dice  No spin nothing  I then made my third big mistake of the dayI opened the case upYou know how when you pour kitty litter theres that dust that flies into the air  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time  If it had been cocaine Id be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life  At that point there wasnt much keeping me going eitherI explained to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one  I thanked her and then leftIt was until I was outside swearing to myself wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadnt seen a single cat,Maintaining integrity in the face of adversity or Whyjustwhy,105

lawtechie,21,23,1r39ta,90,The NMR story by usquigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and gamesThe ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agencys name and logo in  they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of   chome plated steel shot You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes The agency ordered about  of these all in their own plain white cardboard boxOne artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken She was already regarded as incompetent and whinyshed do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didnt print or scale correctly on the agencys PostScript printersSo I take my time walking up there When I finally get there I notice a bluepurple tinge on the sides of her monitor I really dont feel like moving this  pound beast so I try degaussing it which it does with a satisfying clunk For some reason degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles strangely relaxing The tinge is still there I cant figure out how a recently calibrated practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor I cant imagine how thatd do anything being so far away I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens As Im moving it back and forth one of the other artists asks me what Im doing I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn youd have to surround the monitor with these thingsAs soon as I say that I realize that the whiny artist has for some reason taken about  of these things still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitorI remove the magnets and try degaussing again The burns still there just fainter Unfortunately thats not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor I try explaining why you dont store bunches of magnets around computer equipment but its like talking to a cat I tell her that shell get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away TLDR Fn magnets how do they work,Ugh I dont that thatll degauss out,113

FenrisFrost,35,14,1r7yh4,87,So where I work a major state organization we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support and their computer needs are quite marginal Word Outlook occasionally Excel and printers There are about ish people in this department  They print a lot so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space They have  total and no person is more than  feet away from any of them  So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers right  Our manager approved and had us order  individual tray printers and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyers PC  This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display so its light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong  It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed The Helpdesk being terribad reported each call in a new and unique way making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure   tickets Red light flashing Printer will not respond Printer no longer accessible Print job lost Even stuff like Computer cannot access network   Our entire Helpdesk all yearslong experienced and not one of them asked any basic question like Is the printer on Does it have paper They just funneled the tickets right through to us because their boss likes us to look bad  Well it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper A few were for them being not even turned on Not a single actual problem in other words and these are all people whove passed the bar exam some with major political affiliations Many were actually pretty embarrassed  We get this storm of tickets now once a month roughly The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue and continues to not even ask these basic questions So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on we have to go do it for them  sigh  ,Its a Printorama,101

TechGuy,34,8,1r518r,73,I have a small IT business in Austin One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N wireless router I had been to her house once before and met Bella her Great Dane she was friendly and pretty relaxedClient tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in She assures me that the dog is fine and to go inI open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps I didnt want to invade her territory without announcing myself first She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle it is yapping at me At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the factI set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat as the home owner suggested As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth This dog is huge and would fuck me up easilyI do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesnt pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing She get closer and I try to go around her She moves to block me so I back up and she gets closer We are just standing there her growling as I think Im about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but when I stop petting she starts growling Im sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on She doesnt really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave The client just moved into the house so she doesnt know anyone but says she is min away and headed my way She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her Yeah right This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with herIm petting Bella who now has her muzzle in my crotch as I scratch her ears If I screw with the pooch my balls are done Now Im like fuck it and call  and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave So Im just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next min petting her every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT mandog petterFinally an officer shows up Im just hoping that he doesnt walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bellas attention and finally make it outI go and talk to the officer to explain what happened he was really nice about it all and Im glad he saved my ass and Bella didnt meet her demise that day I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs He says Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog I really wasnt thinking about that at all when I said it I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit I owe him one for sureThe home owner shows up and the officer leaves Im speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is yo and normally they live to maybe  or  years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down that this is why she behaved that way She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave I really didnt feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for SaturdayI have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they dont bother me at all but Bella was old dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy My new policy is to never enter anyones home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jawsNever againHome owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside I didnt want her to know that I blamed her for the incident she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella Im a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterdayI should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog,Almost got eaten,81

FenrisFrost,7,10,1r5ce7,68,Hello all Big fan first time posting This page helps me keep my sanity This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work I am abbreviating it significantly for lengthits kind of a long oneI work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this largescale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern bit Windows  box to be distributed to all of the states elected officals in all cities where the local officials use them to handle elections and all electionrelated data Im in Tech Support  a genericallynamed department that is basically this locations refuse bin Though I have a tech degree equivalent to adminlevel certs and do tons of adminlevel duties here the head of the department this project originated from well call her Bosslady had zero confidence in my abilities This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance My ACTUAL manager unfortunately is this persons lapdog  so essentially instead of backing his known commodity he threw me under the bus at every turn and they blamed fault after fault on my faulty image which I almost always immediately resolved Dumb stuff like the Image cannot see the printer it is no longer printing and Id go over and find it out of paper for example Whatevs I knew that was coming  that is what our department is here basically a minimumstaffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors This culminated in a big statewide rollout that was handled by a thirdparty company We used a particular model of PC well call it the model  but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs  well call this one the model  There were less than  of these model s out there and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones and instead reimage them onsite About a month into the rollout I come into work and find a stack of these s on my desk with a sticky note that says sdont work I talk to my manager and he says yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out they said the image wont work on s They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over  miles to our office instead  setting the entire days deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern acting like there are hundreds of these out there and Ive screwed the pooch I tell him it works fine with model s He says it doesnt basically calls me a liar I remind him all through the ridiculous testing one of the computers was a  He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern and he tells me Fenrisfrost youre telling me one thing the rollout guys are telling me another Who am I supposed to believe You havent even looked at these machines yetThis was the perfect moment for me to point to the fullyfunctional master computer on my desk I slide the tower out from behind its monitor and reveal the model number  its a I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep Ive had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted Sure looks like it works fine to me I say What is this my boss asks I tell him its the master PC and that its a  See I planned ahead and preloaded all the drivers for both knowing we had a few of these out there already It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the s to take the image  a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed He just stares at me and then eventually leaves TLDR Your first reaction shouldnt be to blame something we tested successfully for months ,It looks like it works to me,78

Jn,28,10,1qzlsc,59,Howdy folks Ive been reading this sub for a while and I finally have a story to shareA little background on me I am the manager of a small electronics store we are a smaller chain that consists of  stores I would not consider myself an expert exactly but I can solve most basicadvanced problems I build my own pcs at home and troubleshoot most of my own issuesThis story starts a little way back so stick with me An older gentleman walked in with his laptop Now this thing was old and I mean that He told us it was around  years old I dont think it was that bad but the base of the laptop was about  alone and it was running XP He was looking to get an updated machine no problem thats what Im here for So we look at the available machines and we find one of our lowmid range machines that would be a perfect fit for him He requests a data transfer so I write it up and turn him over to the techs so they can see exactly what he wants to transfer Well his computer contained the following A folder called Things i dont use  pictures in his My Documents  I repeat  email in his outlook inboxAbout  contacts in outlookSo we get the contacts and  pictures transferred for him We also made sure he had the right drivers for his printer installed and that it was working We call him to inform him his new machine is configured and ready for him Well today he showed up with his wife to pick it up They came in carrying ANOTHER laptop and printer He went on back to talk with the techs and his wife asked me if I could figure out for her why her printer wasnt working Now here are the important details to remember here for this part of the story The printer was connected to the laptop via USB with cable that were labeled with things like printer left referring to the left port on the back of the printer She did not have the power cable with itWith that in mind on with the story So I open up the laptop and get it started My first thought was to get power to this printer so that I could test it if I did get it working I asked about the power cord do you happen to have the power cable with youShe stared at me blankly for a moment then dropped thisUmmm Im not sure Its wirelessOk but I still need powerOh well i have some other cables I grabbed out in the car maybe I have it thereAwesome maybe Ill get lucky here Sure enough she returns with a bag containing the power cable Now she has me wondering if she has been thinking it didnt need power but upon grabbing the power cable I see there is also a label on the end of this cable so at least she HAS used it in the past So now we have the printer on and its hooked up to the laptop but no goMy next thought was to check the usb plug So I give it a little tug to make sure its well connected and I finally found the problem The usb popped right outusb plugs are usually connected more tightly than that I look at the side of the laptop and find that the place it was connected was not at all a USB port but rather the network plug To quote the mythbusters Well theres your problemMoved it to the USB and BAM The computer recognized it and test page printed successfully She looked at me like I was a wizard She asked what she owed and she was shocked when I told her nothingBut seriouslywireless power We arent that advanced yet,I dont know its wireless,69

OldPolishProverb,3,6,1r8b6k,72,Background I work in a college IT department Our IT work area is one large common room One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass You know a fishbowl One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data because of the the aforementioned glass wall So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall It doesnt go all the up the the  foot ceiling not exactly elegant but it is functional and solves the problem After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window Maintenance is called and they replace it figuring a bad roll of film A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again Maintenance is called again and it is removed the window cleaned and film replaced This doesnt stop the problem It keeps peeling falling off the glass but only in this one section All of the other films have been good since day one Brute force now comes into play Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall We are all stumped We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass But there is no change One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy I finally finish my project go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didnt like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift I wasnt going to deal with this after a  hour shift I walked away quietly and talked to his boss the next day Nice guy decent tech solid worker just not the fastest port on the rack   ,I can see clearly now ,78

SkraeNocturne,14,8,1qwt6o,50,Bit of backstoryTheres a server at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners  This software has a limit of about  connections at any given time  This software or at least their installation of it has an issue with disconnecting sessions  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline the connection remains open in the server software even though it has nothing to connect to  When the scanners come back online they open a new connection in the server software even though their old connection is open  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers arent running as many scanners as the client does  A quick note this was apparently not by design they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed themSo we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit send an email to our help desk to let us know and restart the machine  We are getting the emails but its apparently not always restartingSaturday I got this emailgtFrom  Shipping person  gtSubject  ltprogramgt high importance  gtBody  Are ltprogramgt is down Can you get it upgt gtThanksgt gt gtShipping personI dont work weekends  Weekends are my day to run errands and relax so I didnt see the email until  hours later  If you have a high priority process go down why would you email somebody on their day off  Our help desk email and phone number are labeled on every computer they have  I know because I put them there  Using those will get the issue taken care of so much faster instead of several hours laterTLDR  This is high priority Ill inform them using low priority channels,Just a quick one from the weekend,58

frozenfoxy,1,6,1r1o5q,47,So I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe Being the night owl I am I was all too happy to accept a position from AM to AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people Of course supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment  One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed It sounded interesting so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls Whenever the man turned it on it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed  Our first thought was some sort of virus and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over  days old Nope not a language barrier after all  About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the preinstalled antispyware program as well This came up with a lovely  or so hits Pretty high compared to most of his coworkers but not the highest we had ever encountered  With all these cleaned up we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved At this point the sun was starting to rise and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call Painfully he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup  Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer The man exclaimed immediately YOU ARE DOING THIS WHY It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer  He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office A good  to  popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisors screen as soon as he got into the system The first seven windows that had opened were dialup porn services either in Russian or English When asked about them the man stated they were vital to his work which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute  As we were calming down the door to the office opened It happens to sit very near our supervisors desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center After taking a few steps forward she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisors screen Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation Hes Russian The manager shook her head and left without a word a visible blush on her face causing our laughing to pick up again  We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily but even to the final day we worked there together wed all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn,Night of the Phantom Open Programs,53

FenrisFrost,13,0,1r678j,44,My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely This was significant An admin actually immediately resigned over it My immediate supervisor Lapdog to a more domineering one did nothing to defend us  as if to reinforce his impotency the email came from her with and Lapdog bolted on to her signature This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute Gov building in the dead center of a major American city and some bigwig walked through our IT area and didnt see enough going on So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time and not to expect much Then this gem for my department specifically the only IT people with laptops we are forbidden from working from home at all The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions are the exact words used Ironic considering A they gave us laptops and B we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines People outside IT use VPN constantly to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines and set their passwords to not expire because they dont come in for  months at a time But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady we have a pretty good rapport so our talk is usually casual That was a really bad idea I say I dont think so he says confidently Most people when they work from home they arent even working half the timeI nod Yeah but now youve made it so that on days when we cant make it here they wont be working at all I hear his Outlook notification go off just then Found out later it was one of his best admins giving his notice citing this policy change as his reason ,Good timing,44

Kataclysm,25,5,1r2eke,38,I work in IT Ive been involved professionally for going on seven years now and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on  I cant tell you how many times Ive explained to people the importance of having a secure password changing it regularly updating ALL account passwords when youre compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed and stressing the importance of not using a universal passwordI dun fed upFlash back to about  months ago My personal Walmartcom account was accessed without my knowledge and around  worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics The timing was pretty awful for this because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills with accompanying late fees as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund After the two weeks of hell ordering new debit cards because at the time I wasnt sure exactly HOW I was compromised I decided it better to be safe than sorry and generally being completely broke with  kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasnt a heck of a lot of fun I ended up getting the charges reversed This mistake cost me around  I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time I used a unified password system  password to rule them all My old password was a mere six characters long alpha only They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random but still not complex enough I trusted Walmartcom to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease so I didnt have to spend that  seconds remembering my information and typing it inLooking back I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer because I never shop on Walmartcom But hey lesson learned passwords changed computers nuked and reloaded from orbit Its the only way to be sure problem resolved During this time of extreme paranoia while I suspected everything and anything I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different much more complex passwords  digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum I was feeling pretty secure I felt nobody was going to get the best of me againExcept I forgot one account A rather important one tooMy PaypalFast Forward to this last Monday morning Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls complaints and general incompetence I check my personal email on my personal laptop and see a few emails from PaypalKenneth Harrison accepted your payment Timestamp at  AM Im pretty sure I was asleep during this time Or at least trying to sleep Son of a  Followed by another email from PaypalImportant We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal accountWell good for you nice to see you didnt put a stop to it Thanks loads all you did was limit my account didnt ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through Thats just brilliantSo I look at the first email and turns out this individual so kindly transferred  to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors because they did a great job of screwing me overI dutifully log into Paypal and immediately update my password from my old insecure one which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account Shame on me I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction Still waiting hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kindSo now again all my funds are tied up for at least another  days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays This is completely my own fault preventable and I hope this is received as I meant it a cautionary tale for other IT workers The rules are not just for others they are for us as well and when we are caught not following proper procedures not only is it extremely embarrassing it can make us look bad to our clients should they discover our hypocrisy,When changing account passwords dont forget to change ALL of them,43

mdsnbelle,7,4,1r8mwy,38,Backstory I support a school systemOur middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting  The elementary schools dont After a couple of cycles of trying to guess for the reporting I finally convinced my boss to make this a fullon directive from the Superintendent  It went out in August with reminders in September and OctoberAfter several schools failed to comply we identified our bad eggs sent them to the head of the IT department and he distributed them to the  schools that havent compliedThats when the excuses started  Not from the principals the secretaries who should have been doing this the entire time They keep claiming they did it before but the system deleted their records  Thats what they told their bosses who are now telling their bosses who is now telling my bosss boss that thats what happened  Luckily my boss and I know that thats  not possible The system does not magically delete data that wasnt there in the first place  Im just pissed that the custom system I helped design that Ive now given  years of my life to has this reputation of deleting data at will when its the sheer fucking laziness of my users and their unwillingness to get caught not doing their jobs that is causing the downfall of its reputationSorry for the rant Im just sick of giving up my nights and weekends my holidays and my sleeptime to a system to have its reputation thrown in the toilet by a bunch of unappreciative fuckupsGood lord I need a glass of wine,Its not my fault The system is designed wrong,42

effingWitchDoctor,3,4,1r8pky,21,Hi again TFTS I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss BB might be justified so heres a short and sour oneBB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer He didnt really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech HT and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss securityWe go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems we are going to change all of the passwords All of them except BBs of course because his memorys not what it used to be HT and I look at each other confused we know that this is only going to cause problems but we dont really want to get BB angry by opposing his ideaHT Yeah we can do that BB but Im not sure if its the best way EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far but there are other things we could look in toBB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before respondingBB I dont care what you think HT Change the damned passwordsWe left without upsetting him any further and did it The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks including from BBtldr a party of at least  is required to defeat a toptier illiteratus and we were duoing so we ranedit a word,The day we secured the network,25

SkraeNocturne,2,0,1r8y9u,5,So my client has tasked me with replacing computers in the warehouse and on the production floor  Last month their ITDB person quit to go to another job and Im still ecstatic for her employee satisfaction at this client is almost nonexistent it was worst for her  Were coming up on a month and a half and Im only just now hearing from my boss that theyre going to be hiring somebody because they were convinced that they would never need a database person againBack to the story one of the computers on my replacement list is one they use for ltlarge shipping company well known for their orange and purple logogt shipping and use ltshipping companygts proprietary software  All well and fine  Im doing my best not to have to call their tech support even though my limited experience with them has been great  Low wait times quick resolutionRight now Im having trouble with the database integration since I dont have any documentation on what databases are what where do they pull info etc  I have been implicitly forbidden by the client from asking ltprevious DB persongt what I need to do for anything around here nor do I want to remind her of the system here  So I ask their EDI guy and the guy they keep around because the owner is too softhearted to let him go because hes been around here since the dawn of time even though he doesnt technically have a job to do anymore and hasnt for some time now probably since the start of the information age I would guess  But since he has had experience with their EDI system from a decade ago Ive been told to talk to him if theres a problem  Lets call him DanI just got done speaking with him because I was out of optionsME  Hey Dan do you know what data source the shipping data is pulled fromDAN  That would be ltAccess databasegt  FuckME  Im pretty sure it needs to pull from SQLDAN  No here let me bring up ltAccess databasegt and show youME  Crap  Ok but I really dont think this is what I need to doDAN  No no here  See these tables  That stores the shipping info so you need to import these three tables into ltshipping company softwaregtME  trying to GTFO Great I think that might be what I needed  Ive got a few other things I need to take care of before I head out at that point in ten minutesDAN  Yeah just a minute  So these tables talk to eachother in the ltAccess databasegt and have all the shipping info andME  Ive tuned him out at this point since hes trying to convince me to import an Access database in something that requires an ODBC which while they might share an ODBC I still have no idea which one that is  But Ive got to suck it up and say  Great I think that will help me Ill check it out,Yep this was a mistake,5
Techsupportvictim,237,644,1r5j3f,1649,Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution The scene My retail that also does tech support for our stuff store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know he had set up man vows never to lie to wife again My job is done ,Never lie to your wife,2293
FredFltStn,299,592,1qz6qm,1344,About a year ago the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone s as their company phone Since the Blackberrys that we had previously carried were an older model with few features most of the managers were happy with the switchAlthough the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities some of the people in the office went a little crazy downloading apps and music onto the phone The phones would sync calendars email and the like over the air and didnt need to be connected to a PC Of course many people used their desktop PCs to charge their phone during the day plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone No big deal you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped upOne of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation and asked me to help out Shes not in IT and her computer skills are mediocre at best I sat down at her desk and went through the presentation with her with me driving and her sitting by my side walking me through what she wantedWe came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph so I clicked InsertPicture from the menuApparently the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC More importantly she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies which were now gloriously displayed in extralarge icons across her  monitor I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at ok maybe a few seconds longer than that and she immediately turned  shades of red I blew it off like it was no big deal saved the presentation and told her we could work on it later I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to earThanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Got to know my female coworker a little better,1936

later and my Ones speakers blasted his voice out into the officeHey Jack weve got a problem here he said frustration evident in his voiceIs it NEWPFY I took a sip Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXASCOLLEGE in my contact listI could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it No he didnt do anything He knows better Ive got something new for youHe detailed the situation leaving nothing out  apparently a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to offcampus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant and in his brilliance when he ran into the restaurant he left his tablet and phone on the front seat and the car unlockedThe imbecile also left his keys in the cupholderYou can guess where this is goingTen minutes later when he came out with his order his gadgets were gone and so was his nice new carHe got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did and the administration was in an uproar I shrugged A car stolen Whoopdyshit thats why we have insurance itd be covered The tablet Not so much A police report had already been filed and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them and if it was at all possible to try to save the carIts the principle of the thing I thought to myself as I plugged the kids credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode A few clicks later the police report number was registered with Computrace and the tablet flagged as stolen Such useful tools but only in the right hands I smirked Of course it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misusedAbout twenty minutes later the device stopped moving ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic I took a look at the final location Something seemed off about it I grabbed the nearest crossstreets and plugged it into Google Maps then switched to Satellite View My eyebrows went up at what I saw and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys I drained my coffee then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door I had a drive to make    A SHORT WHILE LATER     I walked into the school phone and bag of fast food  from a rather popular nearby restaurant in hand and strolled into the campus techs officeWhatre you doing here he asked Didnt you track the phone and tabletI nodded and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone followed by the bag of food His eyes widenedYouve got to be jokingI shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before not entirely coincidentally taken outside a rather popular nearby restaurant and he started chucklingI pity him I could sense the laughter rising in him and he stood up and locked his machine The kids in the office he said and walked out of his office with me following I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY who was sitting in the corner stripping down machines for parts in his free periodSure enough the kid was in the office and his father was there too as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in handDid you find my phone the kid said jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech franticallyForget the phone his father said Wheres the carIm honestly surprised he doesnt know I replied Given what he did he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet  and yes his car too  wentWhat are you talking about the dad said his expression blanker than a new chalkboardDoes this look familiar I said turning my phone around to face the teenager and the fatherI went to lunch there today thats where my car got stolen the kid retorted So whatDoes THIS look familiar I repeated flipping to the next picture in the sequence the one Id shown the tech                            TOWING ENFORCED    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATORS EXPENSEHis reply much like his actions which kicked this off was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense I only parked there for like ten minutesAnd thats all they needed to take the car I replied flipping over to the phones last location in Google Maps which when looked at via satellite view was the towing companys storage lot As of ten minutes ago your phone was there and I daresay youll find the tablet and keys there tooHis father glared at himThe cop glared at himHe glared at meI breathed on my fingernails then buffed them on my buttondown So phone found tablet found car found universe saved crisis averted But just in case  next time park in the appropriate areas    Yet more goodness lies

sharpie,60,164,1qqw7h,443,So I was talking about my student loans in rexplainlikeimfive and I briefly brought up my first work experience  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion unrelated but how fukkin cool would that beI started the job as a Security Intern which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions but also meant I got to do audits of the University  It was unpaid but it was relevant work experience that I knew I would desperately need  This was fine because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games  Some of them had Autodesk  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth  During that time there I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them  If one went dark I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware relatedThis was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the Security Technician essentially my boss and getting paid was quitting  He hadnt graduated yet but had a better job lined up  Guess who got the bump up  This guy  hour to do the same shit I was already doing  FuckyeahSeaking  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth  I could pretty much make up my own hours  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin down  I wasnt building the images or doing the complex stuff but the IT Archwizards were glad I was there  I allowed them to focus  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paidAll great things do eventually go sour though  And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet  I walked in another day and there was something wrong  It wasnt the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server  It was different  You could smell it in the air  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin  I own that name OldSpice fuck you  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin who was my boss now was changing his grades  Now you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin  Well because thats how you do it when youre a diploma mill  Who can you pay less than one of the students youre supposed to be educating  Well anyways he didnt deny it and he couldve got away with it if he hadnt become too greedy  But alas guess who got bumped up again  Not this guy actually  No one did  Which was okay because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything wed need for at least a little while  So life went on with one less friend because he left mid semester and never actually graduatedNows the best time to tell you about the IT Staff  There was J who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than Ill ever know  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasnt a foreign national  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells  Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system  Finally there was M  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled   But thats all you ask  Yes these  guys managed a University of too many  They did it alone  They did it entirely without thanks  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much but they believed they were making it a better place  They thought that if they werent there then who would protect the neckbeards  Certainly not their parents  They paid for them to be here  To get them out of their basement  There was also the IT Manager R  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew  He had a lot of other roles to fill but he trusted J S M and I and so we were largely unmanaged  It was how we survived and it was how the school survivedOne day sitting with us in our circle of chairs R just slammed his fist down stood up and said I dont usually do this but unless any of you object Id like to bring Sharpie on full time  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life  By the end of the day there was a contract on my seat  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit  I was sad but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life  kyear  FYI happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together  They are not peanut butter and jelly  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste but not jellyShortly after him S amp J quit as well  Im pretty sure R knew they would quit too but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing  I dont remember who had a job lined up first but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together  This was mostly because of politics but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone with thousands of students and staff depending on them  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it  Sick of not being paid enough I found out later they made kyear each there  Both had put in  years at least never a raise or vacation  Sick of the disrespect  wed have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair  We would have to drop everything no matter how serious and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot  There were also days once a month where wed be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned  As a footnote  If theyd known that one day a few years into the future theyd be lined up literally and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered Im sure they wouldve done things different  But anyways  I couldnt get fired because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure the network and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty  So at least we had that going for us which was niceThings really started going down hill close to Christmas time though thats when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP  Windows  was coming out and our image which I didnt know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it because of the servers because of the network  I made the decision to drop Ghost mostly because I hated Symantec but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M tokens supported  Keep in mind I didnt know dick about doing this  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in  months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows  environment  But also in that time I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hogWhy was the Windows  shitty  Well partly because I was still learning partly because we were using roaming profiles and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images discovering if you didnt set the skipRearm flag before you sysprepd an image  times you irreversibly fucked your image  Seriously when Windows  first came out that was pretty much undocumented  I remember when it started getting cold  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty  I remember it reaching  in there and I sent M a text saying Hey man  Im freezing in here  I have a jacket but Im still really cold my feet are numb  Can you call maintenance I cant find their number  He sent me back lol  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happenSo can you imagine being  being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before  computers starting to image them all and knowing just fukkin knowing that if this didnt work that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but everyones day  Youll never guess what didnt work  Spoiler  Pretty much everything  It took  hours to image  systems of the thousand we had because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network each one was being handled unicast creating its own link to the server creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file  I felt really fuckin clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit  But never the less shit did not work  Shit did not work for a long time  At first it was that no one could log in  I fixed that it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile theyd pull based on what the system was supposed to be  Then it was all of the undocumented bandaids that had been wiped away in XP  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start gt Fucking Computer because they were Babyboomers and change scared them  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldnt use Windows   I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition  Which believe me can be a lot if youre not up for figuring it out yourself  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground an undocumented network and server infrastructure and updates that had to be done manually  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons because it wasnt worth the drive homeShit was still fucked up around Valentines day  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though  They fucking should have though  I would have if I wasnt me  They didnt give a shit though  They could still play video games and thats all they ever needed  Valentines day was important to me because the staff and faculty fuckin rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick  For the record popcorn comes in  sizes Small Medium Large My Dick  You get the idea  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands  One pissed off day a few months later I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig  She found out and sewed that shit back together  I wish Id taken that pig when I leftThings eventually settled down though  I persisted overcame and continued to do the best I could  They were worried about the security of the systems and they fuckin shouldve been so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him who Ill call D M and Sharpie  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real stridesThen one day they hired a new IT Manager  That was pretty much when things started going down hill  I couldve survived and probably wouldve stayed there a lot longer if they hadnt brought this guy on  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being  And so he did  This guy gobbled the Presidents balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy  Anything the President wanted this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience  None at all  Guy didnt know dick about management so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos  He ruined that shit for me  Not that I liked it that much but I went from Meh to unconditionally hating that shit  Hed talk about wanting to bang her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice which was his real voice  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid  A kid that looked like a Naird chimp by the way  Eventually they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I wont go into detail about  Guy didnt know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable which was fine but the guy was making more than twice my wagesNeedless to say shit got pretty tense in there  M D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didnt like it  Of course they let go of the guy they could to make a point  They shit canned M  I was furious but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present  Universally up until the new IT Manager we were all huge gun enthusiasts M especially  He found zen in the long distance shot  He owned a rifle that Ive long since forgotten but was chambered in  Winchester Magnum  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his goingaway present  The opportunity to shoot a grill size full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin nowhereSo of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning  Got there at AM had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there it was still pitch black  Stars look different when theres no light pollution to fuck with your night view  EDIT   So anyways were out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and hes stoked and Im stoked and I walk it about  yards out to the side of a giant hill  You dont know terror until youre out in the wilderness  yards away from the only light which is a trucks low beams  Theres just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out  But anyways I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didnt want to get eaten by a bobcat or something  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back  Terrified  I get back there and Ms like  dude whered you put it  I look back and its too fuckin dark to see it  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and theres a glowstick in there  I walk out tie that shit on and finally get back  Ms already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab  What felt like an hour was probably  seconds as M zeroed in prone and took his shot  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death  At first you could see it spin because of the light but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off Thats when for the second time that night I discovered what terror really isIt sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to takeoff speed but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably  or  feet to the right from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again  It did this two more times toward us during which I truly thought it was intentional but finally died down  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned I looked down and M was still prone  Hed never moved  He just in the epitome of alpha male badassery said cool  We both walked out to get it partly because you dont leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up but also because he wanted to show his  year old daughter  He said she loved this kind of stuff  We shot some targets after that then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind  That was the last time I actually saw the guy,Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired,607

tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papersI thought I told you last week she replied with a smile Dont be in such a hurry to grow up Youll get there eventually and youll always wish youd spent more time as a kidThe kids are stupid he grumbled They dont know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail They dont know how to catch Carmen They keep asking me how to use the Fodors guide They cant even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zappedThe teacher knelt Not all kids are like you you know Some are lucky some arent quite as lucky Either way dont complain Just help them if they get stuckFine Ms D he muttered Can I PLEASE have my coffee I have stocks to checkShe shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage I dont want to know just why youre doing thatHe scampered off coffee and newspaper in hand    LATER THAT DAY    After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment the boy was tired of it He went into his sanctuary the computer lab and sat down at one of the Macs then started a game of Number MunchersA pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard causing him to look up in annoyance Hey Cut it outThe boys malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard causing the Troggle to eat his MuncherWhatd you do that forYoure stupid the girl sneered at him Youre a nerd and we all hate you Go back to the school you were at beforeQuiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him but before he could say something or do something the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulderAhem You know youre not supposed to say things like that rightSorry the girl apologzed quite insincerelyGet to your lunch break Youre not allowed in here right now If I catch you acting like that again you dont get to play games in here for a monthAfter the girl walked out the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed Look theyre going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourselfI know he muttered quietly I just dont know what to doJust dont hit her Its not nice and boys dont hit girls The teacher walked off and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started readingMacworld Macintosh Secretshttpimgurcomdie    THAT EVENING    The boy was in heavenHis mother worked for the county teaching ESL English as a Second Language to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights and sometimes if his father was working late his mother would bring him and his sister along with her but she left them with the childcare crew which a lot of the time took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in itAfter a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego the boy returned to reading his massive tome and an idea struck him one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentorFortunately there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening and the machine he went to was unoccupiedAfter a few quick looks around he slipped a floppy disk into the drive and opened up a single program on it He flipped through pages in the book occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger clicking and typing the whole way performing a veritable ritual on the machine one with an unclear finishAn hour later he ejected the disk shut the machine down and went back to his bookWhen his mother took him and his sister home he felt a deep satisfaction knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period    THE NEXT DAY    Okay kids the teacher called out loudly Go to your assigned computers sit down turn it on and get ready Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skillsThe boy went to his machine complied with the teachers request and began playing A short while later the bully raised her voiceMs D The computer isnt workingThe teacher got up and went over doubleclicked Macintosh HD and the Trash Can opened She closed it reopened it and the same thing occurred She opened the Trash and Mac HD opened with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documentsHuh Well Ill have to fix this Itll take a while She looked around and there were no machines free Well theres no computers available so youre going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math SorryThe boy smiled to himself at his workstation and when the class went to its next period lunch he went over to the teacher whod had no time at all to work on the machineUm Ms D Can I help you fix the computerShe shook her head I dont think so This isnt something someone like you would know how to fixI think I kind of do know how to fix it Ms D Can I at least try pleaseShe shrugged and gestured to the machine Be my guestTwenty minutes passed and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while The teacher had stopped what she was working on and went over to watch the boy at workSo someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon She stroked her chin And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can then renamed them to each otherI think thats what happened the boy said a huge grin on his faceShe smirked and tousled his hair And I suppose that thats going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroomI dont think so Ms D the boy replied quietly I only think Im going to do it if she picks on me again He looked up in alarm at his faux pas I mean um I just told on myself didnt IThe teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his earTold on yourself for whatThe boy looked up and a smile was on his faceCome on I think Ive got a few things to teach you the teacher said beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer rooms storage room I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here and I think youre the right kid to do it Jack    More modern things tickle your fancy Try

lawtechie,21,54,1r15nt,286,This isnt a story about how useless and annoying users can be Its a story about how vendors can ship prebroken products and let us figure out how to support them Its  My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool Ive volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner For some unknown reason this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wirelesswired bridgeaccess point The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired networkWe configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired networkThis mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops Were using the best security we can get  bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting Everybodys happy for two days Then all of a sudden cards cant authenticate It doesnt seem to be a driver or OS issue since Macs or PCs wont connect with onboard or vendor cards The vendor goes from being really happy that were doing such a large rollout to dead quiet Turns out theyre unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network For speculations sake I reboot the access controller All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect I contact the vendor again and they claim theyll do some fixes in the next firmware update whenever that isI run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers power to the lamp timer I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at  AM and turn them back on at AM I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart I tell my boss what Ive done so he doesnt freak out about this horrible kludge Two months later the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesnt fix the problem For all I know the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks,Ill fix the wireless network I just need three lamp timers two extension cords and some electrical tape,340
Shadowlady,27,56,1r046v,279,First of Im not sure if this is the right sub as its not your typical Tale from Tech support its more shocking than funny but I need to share it Also I wouldnt mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similarBackstory I do outsourced tier  IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter Lets call the user DaveDave had been chasing this already calling repeatedly and stressing our level  out I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately calm him down by letting him know Im on it That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with  updates to find all the relevant bits of information That didnt work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates So instead I caught Daves wife a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop I sheepishly apologized explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket so I thanked her for her help told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didnt work I would call her back The number worked but Dave was not picking up I left a Voice mail and went to work Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully I tried to call Dave again but still no answer It was nearing the end of the work day and I didnt want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something thinking his issue was not resolved yet So I called Daves wife to tell her that just in case he calls her let him know he can go home the issue is resolved Then Daves wife drops this on me there has been a major explosion at the gas refinery Dave works at  people were killed and another is missing She hasnt been able to reach Dave either I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what were speaking about They dont speak Dutch so they cant understandDave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife Im completely stunned I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and thats why he didnt reply The moment I hang up I get a message from first line Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me He just wants to know if his laptop is workingThe only proof I can provide httpukreuterscomarticleuktotalexplosionidUKBREAIPPhttponlinewsjcomnewsarticlesSBEdit added reuters link because wsj has a paywall,I just had the biggest scare of my career and I need to vent,335
squigglechicken,72,44,1r2ucm,270,A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university In addition to the standard IT tasks AD management printer maintenance Outlook setup etc we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devicesThe crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR Nuclear Magnetic Resonance machine In essence the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough  Kelvin  Farenheit to superconduct and generate a very strong stable magnetic field A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field This can be used for example to see if a professors chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule It was a pretty awesome machine and cost a few hundred thousand dollarsWhen we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university He brought a gaggle of PhD students a lot of grant money and tons research equipment with him including a brand new NMR The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused saying No thanks my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do Fair enough well leave it to themFlash forward a couple weeks later The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR which was being tested that morning quenching  the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithfullike geyser The cause one of those experienced grad students had connected the NMRs computer to an old STEEL CASED power strip As soon as the magnets were powered up the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheatTLDR  Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from  in repairs,Magnets THATS how they work,314

SirEDCaLot,53,42,1r4i39,229,This takes place several years ago  Id just been hired by a small independent IT firm  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses and we helped out a few home users as well it wasnt something we advertised but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems and we were happy to oblige  We werent cheap but we took pride in giving everybody even the dumb ones service with a smile and our customers were generally quite happyIm a brand new hire only been there a day or so  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers and a shiny new neverbeforeused phone extension has been assigned to me  Its also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or anotherSo my phone rings the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasnt from a queue this caller punched my extension directly  The caller is a middleaged sounding womanMe This is EDC first name how can I help youCaller  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot first and last name at company  she knows my name and extensionMe  Yes it is  What can I do for you todayCaller  Well Im having a problem with my Apple Silver computer its probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card impossible my cards didnt exist yet and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thingMe  Absolutely Id be happy to help you out  Do you or your company have an account with usCaller  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer hes very smart you see but now hes in the Navy so he isnt around to fix my computer anymore can you help meMe  Id be happy to help but first we have to set up an account for you  Can I get your first and last nameCaller  Thank you  My name is firstname and I really dont know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers hes very good with themMe  That sounds very exciting  What is your street addressCaller  Oh I live just off mainroad near the WalMart its a nice neighborhood but its just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway minutes of this go by during which I hear all about this womans son but despite many attempts still havent gotten past the name and address area of the New Account pageCaller  blah blah blahSo I really dont know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and hes on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library remember she has a Mac and Im almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire meMe face firmly planted on desk    uhhh  thats not really my department  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computerCaller  Well my son used to fix my computer but now hes in the Navy so he cant fix my computer for me facepalm but Ive been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book apparently the right book for working on Macs who knew every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you doMe  Um Im not really the one to talk to for that if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé   meanwhile furiously typing out an allcaps IM to my boss  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxxxxxxxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THISCaller  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I dont want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computerMe  Well you

should go check on my potrclick  she hung up not meFINALLY  minutes later am holding a nowdisconnected phone staring at a New Account screen with nothing but a first nameEpilogue  Boss wasnt too impressed with my IM ignoring customers  bad but seemed to understand my explanation  We both felt bad for the woman but theres not much we could do to help we couldnt afford to sit on the phone for hoursThe woman called back two weeks later seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone her first cell phone ever  The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a severalminutelong voicemail  I forwarded it to the boss who after listening for  seconds called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment hehWe never did figure out how she got my name or extensionTLDR The Navy offers many exciting careers,How the hell did you get my extension,271

effingWitchDoctor,43,33,1r6dl6,195,Hello again TFTS Todays story takes place about  years ago at a small software company  people you probably havent heard of I was the network admin and did some inhouse scripting when I had time we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems This particular day we had one of those problemsWe had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing We were about  done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quickerJava is not a fast language Its great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them The powers that be bosses decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer VP who happened to start work on this very dayVP claimed to have  years of experience developing C He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prizeSo on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door EWD we just got a ticket from VP Apparently he cant access the development serverHuh I set him up and tested his account on Friday Forward it and Ill take a lookA few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and Im a little surprised It reads something to the amount ofi dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do hereIm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see whats amiss After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems I email him explain that Im the admin and ask if he can give me more information about the problem I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go A few minutes later I get the next emailhaha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss BB and have HIM fix this shitNow Im starting to get a little annoyed I email him back that Ill be over soon and deliberately waste  minutes looking at pictures of cats Feeling calmer I set off to figure out whats wrong only to find him about  feet away standing at the door to the server room Our server room like any server room should be is locked and airconditioned It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users Only the Head Techie HT the bosses and I have keys to this room anyone else must access it remotely Some use terminal editors directly into the server some pushpull with git all are welcome to use ftp but none are allowed in the roomI walk over to VP to explain this but as soon as he realizes who I am he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voiceIve been standing outside this door for  fucking minutes I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck inThe guy is practically shouting in my face Im shocked but quickly recover VP we dont go in there except for maintenance You can access it remotely using vim or git but no oneI DONT GIVE A SHIT IVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASSBy this point people have come out of their offices to see whats going on BB appears on scene and tells me to take  and let him sort it out I hear him calming VP as I walk offAt this point Im pissed It takes a lot to piss me off but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth After about a minute My Boss MB walks in and closes the door He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless so I just throw it out there years my ass How could someone develop for  years and not know how to edit code remotely What are they even doing over at otherCompanyI dont know I also dont know what BB is going to do about it That fella sure has a temperWe talk for a few minutes and theres a knock at the door BB VP and HT walk in VP has the most loathesome smirk Ive ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier BB looks as happy and clueless as everBB Ooooookay then Now that were all fine and dandy lets talk There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but theyre really easy fixes and heres what were going to do Were going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server VP also wants more monitors so were also gonna put a video card in it too EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because its his workstation And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind usBB is beaming MB and HT both look numb and I probably do too VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand Nothing personal buddyBB Great If anyone needs me Ill be in my officeBB and VP head out leaving HT MB and I doing our best someoneshotmydog faces We discuss it agree its ridiculous and they eventually leave to go carry it out I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new jobtldr we gave a new employee the wrong workstation and he was understandably upset,The day I realized I was going to quit my last job Warning Language,228

shinycharizard,54,49,1qx9zc,166,I could probably retire by now Especially when customers like this make me repeat myself five times I try my best to be crystal clear when I tell them we dont have their files but some of them seem to think that if they just keep bugging me about it Ill magically find them hiding in a corner somewhereBackground Site hosting tech support It goes like this Customer gives us money We give them storage space When it comes time to renew we send them a bunch of annoying emails saying something like hey were gonna take your money mmkay and if we try to take their money and the payment fails expired card wrong security code insufficient funds etc then we send them a bunch more emails saying hey we couldnt get your money so that means youre not paying for data storage anymore if you want to have sites on our servers you gotta pay bro and if they still dont pay for their data storage we deactivate their account Their sites go offline for  weeks with an error that says to contact tech support If they still dont do that after  weeks of expiration all files are deleted If you didnt back up your files youre a moron INTERNET RULE  IF A FILE MATTERS TO YOU HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF IT ON DIFFERENT HARD DRIVES Whether this is your PhD thesis paper or your website make multiple copies of it so in case someone steals your hard drive or a typhoon swallows your computer whole on your trip to the Phillipines or if your account expires on a paid data storage service you have another copy of it somewhere Disclaimer Personally I think we should keep data longer than that but that data starts piling up fast so I guess I cant really argue with that policy Theyre not paying anymore theyre not a customer Not my policy not my rule Im just paid to deliver the bad newsSomething else people fail to understand just because once upon a time we had a backup it doesnt mean we will permanently have that data always and foreverThis poor sap submits an email about his account Him My account was expired but I paid for it But theres nothing thereMe Your account and all of its files databases emails backups etc were deleted after  weeks of expiration on date Youll need to upload all of your files to the server again as we no longer have any data to restoreHim I didnt know this would happen Last time my account expired you restored it What can I do looks like it probably wasnt expired for  weeks so when he renewed it there were still backupsMe You can start new websites for your domains We kept your data for  weeks after it expired but you failed to renew it quickly enough All data including backups are deleted On expiration date when it expired we actually threatened to delete all data within  hours However it looks like we did not we kept it for  weeks But you did not renew quickly enough I also quoted the email which surprise surprise tells you that were gonna delete your files if you dont renew your accountHim I dont use that email account so I didnt see this message The files were deleted recently You have some backup Please help me I need those files My clients have no backup Im desperate Please help me I await your responseMe We do not have any backups that we can restore If you do not use that email address it is your responsibility to update the email address on file to one you do use to make sure you receive important notices on your account We kept your data for  weeks past its expiration All data was permanently deleted on the deletion date We do not have any backups whatsoever that we can restoreHim I understand that But a few months ago my account expired and you restored it doesnt change the fact that Ive repeated myself  times in saying I dont have any files whatsoever that I can restore from a backupMe Your data has been permanently deleted after your account was expired for  weeks There is nothing further we can doHim This time it was the same It had been over three weeks and could be restoredMe We do not have any backups that we can restoreAs if telling him  times that we do not have any backups to restore he opened up a live chat with another one of our technicians just to hear it from someone else I wonder how many times that person had to say it,If I earned a dollar every time I told someone we dont have a backup of their files,215

FUT,36,43,1qy0uq,164,Xpost from a comment I made on a gaming subreddit Was told it fits hereSo a few years back at Gamestop I sold a brand new xbox NOT THE USED POS  Like next week he comes in and of course I happen to be working Im thinking red ring at this point as this was just before the redesignNopeThe conversationevent goes as follows to the best from my memory My manager even filled in a few parts that I forgotPut this image into your mind before reading the conversation I am a lb skinny white teen trying to calm down a lb super pissed off black man He was chill last week Me Hey welcome to gamestopAt this point I knew it was gonna be interesting as he didnt respond stared me down and proceeded to slam the  box on the counterMr T Yo yall sold me a roachboxIm calling him Mr T just cause his build haircut and angerMeRoachbox Does it turn on When it turns on is there any kind of red lights displayed on the power button or does the power supply have a light that changes Im about to just take it out of the box and test in myself cause this wasnt going anywhereMr T IDK ABOUT THAT SHIT YALL SOLD ME A MOTHERFCKIN ROACH BOX My manager hears this going down and comes over to help about once a month people go fucking mental in gamestop so its kinda the normSo my manager and I open the box and it smells pretty rank Not to be confused with dank wasnt that kind of roachboxIm thinking to myself wtf happened in  weeks to make this thing smell like someone took a dump in the CD tray The female employee working with us at the time for only  days so far I might add ran to bathroom to vomit and forgot that only the manager has the keysyeah it was frantic rush but I digressSo I reluctantly remove the xbox from the packaging to test and inspect As I am doing that my manager makes some progress with Mr TMr T THERE ARE GOD DAMN COCKROACHES IN THE XBOXNow Ive heard of roaches in electronics but never seen it in person let alone  week old xbox  Ok so now the inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number Check Get gloves from the back room Check I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fineSo I plug this smelly POS into our test unit turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction There other people in the store minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed so it was like Whack a mole on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it Honestly we didnt get them all Now knowing what a roach box is my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we dont want to Mr T See yall sold me a roachbox Manager Do you by chance have a problem with roaMr T MOTHERFCKER ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE MY HOUSE IS NEW THERE AINT NO ROACHESI pretty much take the back seat on this one I really dont have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed locked in our back room and our store was the newest in the area There were no roaches in the storewell before the xbox was brought back there wasnt at atleastSo hes getting more and more pissed Its getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situationlike everyone left the store at this point cause Mr T was gonna explode at any second I explain the situation to the district manager who says we cant take it back I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of salescustomers he is causing He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard he district manager started the customer is always right bullshitMy manager couldnt afford to lose his jobcareer as he put years into getting a store  I was about to quit and go to college fulltime so I decided to just return the console under my name still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy etc In the space where you say why I wrote ROACHBOX  Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went We made it clear to Mr T that it was user error and we fixed his fucking error The customer is not always right Get your house sprayed for bugs or dont live like a hoarder I never got contacted about the  shrink There are various reasons why they let it go but thats a story on its ownWe replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times it was just clear enough to lip read the customer Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that TLDR  Roachbox  Enough said,Roachbox ,207
Tomagathericon,18,29,1quk95,146,Bear with me please because this needs some backstory  Some time ago i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women They had only one tech guy and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed so most of the less important stuff just got ignored Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long Word got around i made work easier for people and soon i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy    So one day one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long  Now to explain this all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS Large Document Managing System with different lists for each dayIn order to create a transfer history for a customer these were usually created and billed per month youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually as each day was a seperate list  Now youd think they would just copy what they need paste it in a textfile then print that file when they have everything Nope that would be too easy  Instead what they did was print every single transfer one by one each on a new page then get an empty piece of paper cut out all the transfers they printed this is the part where the shears come into play glue them on the empty page wait for it to dry then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way    I tried to show them the magics of copy amp paste and while they did notice it going much faster and easier the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods I believe they are still doing it this way    tldr Welcome to the handicraft class Today were gonna make a nice collage out of your parents bank transfers,How to merge two documents without the need for shears,175

RoninSpartan,17,30,1r251v,112,So have I got a tale for you One that has just happened fairly recently A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accusedA little background first though I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a workstudy picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had The offer to take on this position was made because of the server crashing of course the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures and them having  other IT personnel  of whom were under utilized but one ridiculously overpowered network adminThroughout this year after my hire I was able to implement a backup scheme with twotiers attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website learn about Server  to prepare the network to shift from a NovellGroupwise environment to a Windows NetworkingExchange environment and do most if not all of the grunt work of a workstudyThe storyNow because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services However there was one I had acquired administrative access to in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys Shortstuff leaving for another department within the college He had been dealing with the network admin for about  years and just got totally sick of it This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms events and such This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule sometimes it would get too busy to check or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didnt want to see it last minuteSo I read the manual about two months ago shortly after obtaining admin access and found out how to create IT work order notifications tested with one of the other users that book events for the college Success Now we and by we I mean I didnt have to manual check for work orders we were alerted at least  days in advance It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out although no one had mentioned it until last weekI had tried to figure out what could have happened I know I hadnt deleted anything and only added in that notification rule for IT I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldnt find where they might have been since I didnt see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules It puzzled me so I asked Shortstuff what could be going on he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset Ha well I didnt have access so I asked the network admin to look into it He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped I started to think what the hell could have happenedThe IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule or if I might have done something to that system I told him No I didnt delete anything I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert Come to find out yesterday the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime The IT director later that morning had walked into my office because of a FilePrint Server Cluster I was tasked to create I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else I was pissed I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything I looked at my IT director and was shocked So even though I didnt do anything I get my admin access taken away He just replied with Oh and stepped outIt was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry Shortstuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well he said to check the text he had just sent I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well In the huff and puff state the network admin was in without any notice or proper authorization took both my access and Shortstuffs administrative access from that systemWe decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didnt lose their administrative access This was directed toward us that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone elseMe and Shortstuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway when comes along Ladyblonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal She asked about what had happened and we let her know Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization and she uttered I think I might have done that She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought by removing those notification rules she was only removing herself from them I had an intense moment of joy and confidence for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all This was the last straw for Shortstuff and he is going to use it on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years to take down the network admin Later that evening just before I left to head home I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster He then mentioned about us not being at fault but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help Ladyblonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake without us telling her to We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his not just this one but many assumptions and wrongful accusationsWill keep you all informed of the result  Update I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such She has just recently started working here a few months back Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong he gave her a call She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending He stated about me He doesnt know what he is doing He went in the system and screwed something upUpdate  So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with He replied with This has happened in the past to Shortstuff before and I had talked with GODOFIT about it previously It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACEShortstuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GODOFIT will be on the Presidents desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw Shortstuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend  Shortstuff put up with GODOFITs shit for  years I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience We are supposed to have that meeting shortly this will definitely be a point that is brought uptldr strip my admin access and wrongfully accuse me youre going down mofo Edit they hired me cause they needed another IT guy to find out how to back shit up after their server had crashed ,An abuse of power led by a wrongful accusation,142

Zehnpae,17,13,1r05kc,94,I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician  Going into businesses and peoples homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is  You just cant explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of seminude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PCAs with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder Is this job really worth itIve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goesI spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech This was back in late s earlynaughties doubles when it was still a bit of an oddity  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster cheaper and without them having to leave the house  It was no contestMy schedule got busy pretty quick I would get asked for by name more often than not  I had adventures every day was an adventure  I collected stories like pokemon  Stories of delight terror and everything between  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story  The one that haunts you in your waking dreamsI pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon  Id worked that trailer park before  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad  This particular trailer had the mandatory  plastic lawn chairs area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns  Nothing out of the ordinaryI checked my collar knocked on the door and waited  After a few moments your standard old lady lets call her Betsy answered the door  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed Oh youre that geek guy Come on inI took a step inside the door felt a crunch took another step felt another crunch  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked onKitty litterI glanced around and found that it was everywhere  I couldnt actually see the floor itself  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big nope but I was too much the professional  I asked her where the computer wasBetsy smiled either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasnt some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where shed chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter not settling on top of itShe led me down a short corridor crunch crunch crunch crunch  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter crunch crunch crunch  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer a relic of a long gone era  She offered no explanation almost no awareness of it being there  I didnt have the wherewithal to ask  Ive seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanationShe gestured at the computer explained that as of a few days ago it wont turn on anymore  I knelt downyeahI knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button  Standard PC repair operations right  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about  or  inches deepThe power checked out I could charge my phone  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable  No dice  No spin nothing  I then made my third big mistake of the dayI opened the case upYou know how when you pour kitty litter theres that dust that flies into the air  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time  If it had been cocaine Id be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life  At that point there wasnt much keeping me going eitherI explained to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one  I thanked her and then leftIt was until I was outside swearing to myself wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadnt seen a single cat,Maintaining integrity in the face of adversity or Whyjustwhy,107

lawtechie,21,22,1r39ta,89,The NMR story by usquigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and gamesThe ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agencys name and logo in  they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of   chome plated steel shot You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes The agency ordered about  of these all in their own plain white cardboard boxOne artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken She was already regarded as incompetent and whinyshed do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didnt print or scale correctly on the agencys PostScript printersSo I take my time walking up there When I finally get there I notice a bluepurple tinge on the sides of her monitor I really dont feel like moving this  pound beast so I try degaussing it which it does with a satisfying clunk For some reason degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles strangely relaxing The tinge is still there I cant figure out how a recently calibrated practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor I cant imagine how thatd do anything being so far away I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens As Im moving it back and forth one of the other artists asks me what Im doing I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn youd have to surround the monitor with these thingsAs soon as I say that I realize that the whiny artist has for some reason taken about  of these things still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitorI remove the magnets and try degaussing again The burns still there just fainter Unfortunately thats not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor I try explaining why you dont store bunches of magnets around computer equipment but its like talking to a cat I tell her that shell get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away TLDR Fn magnets how do they work,Ugh I dont that thatll degauss out,111

FenrisFrost,35,13,1r7yh4,88,So where I work a major state organization we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support and their computer needs are quite marginal Word Outlook occasionally Excel and printers There are about ish people in this department  They print a lot so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space They have  total and no person is more than  feet away from any of them  So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers right  Our manager approved and had us order  individual tray printers and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyers PC  This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display so its light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong  It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed The Helpdesk being terribad reported each call in a new and unique way making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure   tickets Red light flashing Printer will not respond Printer no longer accessible Print job lost Even stuff like Computer cannot access network   Our entire Helpdesk all yearslong experienced and not one of them asked any basic question like Is the printer on Does it have paper They just funneled the tickets right through to us because their boss likes us to look bad  Well it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper A few were for them being not even turned on Not a single actual problem in other words and these are all people whove passed the bar exam some with major political affiliations Many were actually pretty embarrassed  We get this storm of tickets now once a month roughly The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue and continues to not even ask these basic questions So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on we have to go do it for them  sigh  ,Its a Printorama,101

TechGuy,34,9,1r518r,73,I have a small IT business in Austin One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N wireless router I had been to her house once before and met Bella her Great Dane she was friendly and pretty relaxedClient tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in She assures me that the dog is fine and to go inI open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps I didnt want to invade her territory without announcing myself first She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle it is yapping at me At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the factI set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat as the home owner suggested As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth This dog is huge and would fuck me up easilyI do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesnt pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing She get closer and I try to go around her She moves to block me so I back up and she gets closer We are just standing there her growling as I think Im about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but when I stop petting she starts growling Im sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on She doesnt really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave The client just moved into the house so she doesnt know anyone but says she is min away and headed my way She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her Yeah right This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with herIm petting Bella who now has her muzzle in my crotch as I scratch her ears If I screw with the pooch my balls are done Now Im like fuck it and call  and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave So Im just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next min petting her every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT mandog petterFinally an officer shows up Im just hoping that he doesnt walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bellas attention and finally make it outI go and talk to the officer to explain what happened he was really nice about it all and Im glad he saved my ass and Bella didnt meet her demise that day I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs He says Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog I really wasnt thinking about that at all when I said it I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit I owe him one for sureThe home owner shows up and the officer leaves Im speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is yo and normally they live to maybe  or  years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down that this is why she behaved that way She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave I really didnt feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for SaturdayI have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they dont bother me at all but Bella was old dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy My new policy is to never enter anyones home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jawsNever againHome owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside I didnt want her to know that I blamed her for the incident she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella Im a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterdayI should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog,Almost got eaten,82

pizzadudecook,18,13,1r04ca,72,So I have never posted here before so here we goI am a network adminsys admin for a fairly large company At headquarters we have three buildings One for accounting and IT one for administration and one for distribution A little history our distribution building has been hard to get dedicated internet access to due to its location Instead we shoot a wireless signal over to it from the administration building to feed it internal access as well as internet The setup has been working like a champ for a couple years without issueA couple weeks ago the distribution building called stating they were having issues accessing anything So I go through the normal steps and check each piece of equipment in the line They could all be reached from my desk except the AP in the admin building After a little troubleshooting I decide to get up and o look at the AP Suddenly they shout its working again and the situation is resolvedThis issue would come and go at random times for about a week Finally when distribution called again I dropped the phone and ran to the admin building Now everyone around here has the habit of turning off the lights and closing the door when they arent in the office So I speed down to the room this AP is located in and without thinking about knocking  I open the door because the lights are offAs soon as I look up sitting there is a very nice lady from marketing with her shirt wide open and a breast pump on her chest She was unplugging the AP to plug in the breast pump I quickly slam the door and run back to my office to try and figure out how to diffuse this To this day I always knock on office doors open or closed even if the lights are offTLDR Always knock before entering,Pumping on the clock,85

FenrisFrost,7,6,1r5ce7,72,Hello all Big fan first time posting This page helps me keep my sanity This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work I am abbreviating it significantly for lengthits kind of a long oneI work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this largescale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern bit Windows  box to be distributed to all of the states elected officals in all cities where the local officials use them to handle elections and all electionrelated data Im in Tech Support  a genericallynamed department that is basically this locations refuse bin Though I have a tech degree equivalent to adminlevel certs and do tons of adminlevel duties here the head of the department this project originated from well call her Bosslady had zero confidence in my abilities This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance My ACTUAL manager unfortunately is this persons lapdog  so essentially instead of backing his known commodity he threw me under the bus at every turn and they blamed fault after fault on my faulty image which I almost always immediately resolved Dumb stuff like the Image cannot see the printer it is no longer printing and Id go over and find it out of paper for example Whatevs I knew that was coming  that is what our department is here basically a minimumstaffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors This culminated in a big statewide rollout that was handled by a thirdparty company We used a particular model of PC well call it the model  but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs  well call this one the model  There were less than  of these model s out there and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones and instead reimage them onsite About a month into the rollout I come into work and find a stack of these s on my desk with a sticky note that says sdont work I talk to my manager and he says yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out they said the image wont work on s They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over  miles to our office instead  setting the entire days deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern acting like there are hundreds of these out there and Ive screwed the pooch I tell him it works fine with model s He says it doesnt basically calls me a liar I remind him all through the ridiculous testing one of the computers was a  He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern and he tells me Fenrisfrost youre telling me one thing the rollout guys are telling me another Who am I supposed to believe You havent even looked at these machines yetThis was the perfect moment for me to point to the fullyfunctional master computer on my desk I slide the tower out from behind its monitor and reveal the model number  its a I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep Ive had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted Sure looks like it works fine to me I say What is this my boss asks I tell him its the master PC and that its a  See I planned ahead and preloaded all the drivers for both knowing we had a few of these out there already It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the s to take the image  a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed He just stares at me and then eventually leaves TLDR Your first reaction shouldnt be to blame something we tested successfully for months ,It looks like it works to me,78

OldPolishProverb,3,7,1r8b6k,71,Background I work in a college IT department Our IT work area is one large common room One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass You know a fishbowl One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data because of the the aforementioned glass wall So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall It doesnt go all the up the the  foot ceiling not exactly elegant but it is functional and solves the problem After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window Maintenance is called and they replace it figuring a bad roll of film A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again Maintenance is called again and it is removed the window cleaned and film replaced This doesnt stop the problem It keeps peeling falling off the glass but only in this one section All of the other films have been good since day one Brute force now comes into play Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall We are all stumped We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass But there is no change One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy I finally finish my project go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didnt like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift I wasnt going to deal with this after a  hour shift I walked away quietly and talked to his boss the next day Nice guy decent tech solid worker just not the fastest port on the rack   ,I can see clearly now ,78

SkraeNocturne,14,8,1qwt6o,46,Bit of backstoryTheres a server at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners  This software has a limit of about  connections at any given time  This software or at least their installation of it has an issue with disconnecting sessions  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline the connection remains open in the server software even though it has nothing to connect to  When the scanners come back online they open a new connection in the server software even though their old connection is open  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers arent running as many scanners as the client does  A quick note this was apparently not by design they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed themSo we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit send an email to our help desk to let us know and restart the machine  We are getting the emails but its apparently not always restartingSaturday I got this emailgtFrom  Shipping person  gtSubject  ltprogramgt high importance  gtBody  Are ltprogramgt is down Can you get it upgt gtThanksgt gt gtShipping personI dont work weekends  Weekends are my day to run errands and relax so I didnt see the email until  hours later  If you have a high priority process go down why would you email somebody on their day off  Our help desk email and phone number are labeled on every computer they have  I know because I put them there  Using those will get the issue taken care of so much faster instead of several hours laterTLDR  This is high priority Ill inform them using low priority channels,Just a quick one from the weekend,54

frozenfoxy,1,5,1r1o5q,47,So I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe Being the night owl I am I was all too happy to accept a position from AM to AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people Of course supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment  One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed It sounded interesting so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls Whenever the man turned it on it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed  Our first thought was some sort of virus and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over  days old Nope not a language barrier after all  About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the preinstalled antispyware program as well This came up with a lovely  or so hits Pretty high compared to most of his coworkers but not the highest we had ever encountered  With all these cleaned up we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved At this point the sun was starting to rise and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call Painfully he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup  Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer The man exclaimed immediately YOU ARE DOING THIS WHY It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer  He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office A good  to  popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisors screen as soon as he got into the system The first seven windows that had opened were dialup porn services either in Russian or English When asked about them the man stated they were vital to his work which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute  As we were calming down the door to the office opened It happens to sit very near our supervisors desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center After taking a few steps forward she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisors screen Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation Hes Russian The manager shook her head and left without a word a visible blush on her face causing our laughing to pick up again  We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily but even to the final day we worked there together wed all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn,Night of the Phantom Open Programs,52

Kataclysm,25,4,1r2eke,39,I work in IT Ive been involved professionally for going on seven years now and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on  I cant tell you how many times Ive explained to people the importance of having a secure password changing it regularly updating ALL account passwords when youre compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed and stressing the importance of not using a universal passwordI dun fed upFlash back to about  months ago My personal Walmartcom account was accessed without my knowledge and around  worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics The timing was pretty awful for this because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills with accompanying late fees as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund After the two weeks of hell ordering new debit cards because at the time I wasnt sure exactly HOW I was compromised I decided it better to be safe than sorry and generally being completely broke with  kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasnt a heck of a lot of fun I ended up getting the charges reversed This mistake cost me around  I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time I used a unified password system  password to rule them all My old password was a mere six characters long alpha only They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random but still not complex enough I trusted Walmartcom to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease so I didnt have to spend that  seconds remembering my information and typing it inLooking back I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer because I never shop on Walmartcom But hey lesson learned passwords changed computers nuked and reloaded from orbit Its the only way to be sure problem resolved During this time of extreme paranoia while I suspected everything and anything I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different much more complex passwords  digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum I was feeling pretty secure I felt nobody was going to get the best of me againExcept I forgot one account A rather important one tooMy PaypalFast Forward to this last Monday morning Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls complaints and general incompetence I check my personal email on my personal laptop and see a few emails from PaypalKenneth Harrison accepted your payment Timestamp at  AM Im pretty sure I was asleep during this time Or at least trying to sleep Son of a  Followed by another email from PaypalImportant We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal accountWell good for you nice to see you didnt put a stop to it Thanks loads all you did was limit my account didnt ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through Thats just brilliantSo I look at the first email and turns out this individual so kindly transferred  to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors because they did a great job of screwing me overI dutifully log into Paypal and immediately update my password from my old insecure one which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account Shame on me I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction Still waiting hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kindSo now again all my funds are tied up for at least another  days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays This is completely my own fault preventable and I hope this is received as I meant it a cautionary tale for other IT workers The rules are not just for others they are for us as well and when we are caught not following proper procedures not only is it extremely embarrassing it can make us look bad to our clients should they discover our hypocrisy,When changing account passwords dont forget to change ALL of them,43
