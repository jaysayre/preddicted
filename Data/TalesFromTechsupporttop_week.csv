Techsupportvictim,237,646,1r5j3f,1649,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

FredFltStn,299,593,1qz6qm,1344,"About a year ago, the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone 4s as their company phone. Since the Blackberry’s that we had previously carried were an older model with few features, most of the managers were happy with the switch.

Although the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities, some of the people in the office went a little crazy, downloading apps and music onto the phone. The phones would sync calendars, email, and the like over the air, and didn’t need to be connected to a PC. 

Of course, many people used their desktop PC’s to charge their phone during the day, plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk. The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops, and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone. No big deal, you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped up.

One of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation, and asked me to help out. She’s not in I.T., and her computer skills are mediocre at best. I sat down at her desk, and went through the presentation with her, with me driving and her sitting by my side, walking me through what she wanted.

We came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph, so I clicked Insert/Picture from the menu.

Apparently, the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC. More importantly, she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies, which were now gloriously displayed in extra-large icons across her 27” monitor. 

I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at (ok, maybe a few seconds longer than that), and she immediately turned 10 shades of red. I blew it off like it was no big deal, saved the presentation, and told her we could work on it later. I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to ear.

FredFltStn,165,395,1r22gy,1172,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

jaydude025,157,300,1qw7lx,862,"My partners brother is a complete moron.

I fixed a computer that was crashing and rebooting all the time by switching out the power supply with my old one and replaced the ram, while I was at it I also changed the thermal paste on the cpu as the pc had not been used in years and was all dried up. After about 2 hours of switching out parts and reinstalling windows and software I finally get the pc running normally again with no problems.

Now this is where the dipshit and his almighty knowledge of the gods comes in.

He is convinced that because I fixed it, it must still be broken because it was not him who fixed it, he takes my ram out and replaces it with new ram he just bought and the computer starts crashing with blue screens again.... 4 DAYS he is trying to fix that computer because he is convinced that the ram he JUST brought is not the problem despite the fact that is was working perfectly before he fucking changed it.

And so he finally buys new ram, And now cannot seem to install windows from a usb, absolutely refusing my help he spends the next full day staring at a blank screen like he is going to fix it using only the power of his mind!

Now it has been a few months since all this happened and it is working again, but only now has he realized that my power supply in still in there and he has brought a new one, he is also going to remove all my thermal paste and replace that to.

Now here is the good bit, I replaced the wifi card in it with a 300mbps one ""it only had a 150mbps card in it"" and now he thinks the new wifi card is too powerful for the computer and it is going to ""short it out and blow up""

And this is what I have to live with for the next several months.

PS: It is not his computer its the pc in the lounge room, I fixed it so my partner could use it.

Edit: He reinstalled windows because I installed my copy on there, and not his.

acthrellis,179,216,1qrlh3,833,"**WARNING: LONG RANT**

**Background**:  I am not nearly as smart as most of you, I never went to college, just took some begininer (PC Repair &amp; Networking) classes at a tech school, and then studied certifications on my own.  2 weeks ago I was promoted from a temp position to a full-time IT position, in a company with no in-house IT department.  I've never had an official fix-it job, I freelance when unemployed, and have always been the resident my-mouse-is-possessed-help-me go-to, so this is a huge step for me.  Our company has been RAPIDLY growing and expanding over the past year, so much that no one can keep up, and they can't hire people fast enough.  We have almost a dozen separate IT firms contracted, each one for something different.  One for email, one for helpdesk, one for internet, one for voip, one for each piece of proprietary software, etc.  Shit's crazy.  They have discovered about 3 years too late, that this isn't going to work, and we need our own IT.  Enter me.  I am starting out by supporting our brand-new, custom-made software that goes out to our facilities.

I always assumed it was just ignorance, not pure stupidity.  That all people needed was a chance to learn, and they'd eventually be okay on their own.  *Stop laughing at me.*  So here, are couple from these last two weeks that completely blew my mind.

**Lady calls in, can't login to software.  I have her walk me through what she's doing:**

Lady: ""I open the thingy, click my name, and click the login button.  It's giving me some error.""

Me:   ""Did you type in your password?""

Lady: ""What's a password?""


Now the best part of this: The very first time you attempt to login to this software, it forces you to choose a password.  You cannot ever use this software without personally setting up a password.  I look into her user profile, and it's (I swear I'm telling the truth) ""suckdick12345.""  So, 1.) she has obviously logged in before, and 2.) I am not allowed to do password resets (IDKwhy), I have to tell them their password over the phone.  Ugh.


**Another lady calls in.  The billing reports are all screwed up.  I find out that she can see the future, and is effectively discharging patients before they've received any treatment.  I don't know how this works in her head, because the patients don't leave until they're ready to leave, so.. uhhh.  Anyway, I tell her this, and she says:**

Lady: ""But I like my way.""

Me:   ""I understand, but this is how the system works.  Wouldn't it be much easier to do it right the first time, instead of having to go back in multiple times every day to edit the patient?""

Lady: ""No, because I'm right.  Also, I don't like the color of the software, can you make it pink?  I think if it was pink people would be much happier at work.  And add a link to Facebook so I can check my friends when I'm bored.""

Unfortunately, my phone immediately ""dropped"" the call right then.  Weird.


This got way too long, so I'll save the others for another time if anyone's interested.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the resources and observations!  Like I said, I'm new to this level, and I can't tell you how much you're helping me.

""When it rains, it pours,"" I grumbled, sipping at a drip-brewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and taste.

Given the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurig-brewed coffee, I'd prised open ten K-cups of Dark Magic to fill a double-filter of coffee, which I then brewed up. The weather in Austin had started to get cool again, after a weekend that was an all-too-unpleasant reminder of the ball-scorcher that was summer, and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets. On top of everything, my second-newest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty, so it fell to me to get things done in his stead.

""Never send a PFY to do a network admin's job,"" I continued, sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet, as is my wont, and my cell phone burst into Rick Astley's dulcet tones, signifying an incoming call. I arched an eyebrow - I hadn't expected the campus tech to call me, not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on. A quick flick of the screen later, and my One's speakers blasted his voice out into the office.

""Hey, Jack, we've got a problem here,"" he said, frustration evident in his voice.

""Is it NEW_PFY?"" I took a sip. ""Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXAS_COLLEGE in my contact list.""

I could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it. ""No, he didn't do anything. He _knows better_. I've got something new for you.""

He detailed the situation, leaving nothing out - apparently, a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to off-campus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant, and in his brilliance, when he ran into the restaurant, he left his tablet and phone on the front seat, and the car unlocked.

The imbecile also left his keys in the cupholder.

...

You can guess where this is going.

...

Ten minutes later, when he came out with his order, his gadgets were gone, and so was his nice new car.

He got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did, and the administration was in an uproar. I shrugged. A car stolen? Whoopdy-shit, that's why we have insurance, it'd be covered. The tablet? Not so much. A police report had already been filed, and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them, and if it was at all possible, to try to save the car.

_It's the principle of the thing,_ I thought to myself, as I plugged the kid's credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode. A few clicks later, the police report number was registered with Computrace, and the tablet flagged as stolen. _Such useful tools... but only in the right hands._ I smirked. _Of course, it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misused._

About twenty minutes later, the device stopped moving (ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool), and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic, I took a look at the final location. Something seemed... off... about it. I grabbed the nearest cross-streets and plugged it into Google Maps, then switched to Satellite View. 

My eyebrows went up at what I saw, and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys. I drained my coffee, then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door. I had a drive to make.

- - - - -

**A SHORT WHILE LATER...**

- - - - - 

I walked into the school, phone (and bag of fast food - from a _rather popular nearby restaurant_) in hand, and strolled into the campus tech's office.

""What're you doing here?"" he asked. ""Didn't you track the phone and tablet?""

I nodded, and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone, followed by the bag of food. His eyes widened.

""You've got to be joking.""

I shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery, showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before (not entirely coincidentally, taken outside a _rather popular nearby restaurant_), and he started chuckling.

""I pity him."" I could sense the laughter rising in him, and he stood up and locked his machine. ""The kid's in the office,"" he said, and walked out of his office, with me following. I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY, who was sitting in the corner, stripping down machines for parts in his free period.

Sure enough, the kid was in the office, and his father was there too, as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in hand.

""Did you find my phone?"" the kid said, jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech frantically.

""Forget the phone,"" his father said. ""Where's the car?""

""I'm honestly surprised he doesn't know,"" I replied. ""Given what he did, he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet - and yes, his car too - went.""

""What are you talking about?"" the dad said, his expression blanker than a new chalkboard.

""Does this look familiar?"" I said, turning my phone around to face the teenager and the father.

""I went to lunch there today; that's where my car got stolen,"" the kid retorted. ""So what?""

""Does THIS look familiar?"" I repeated, flipping to the next picture in the sequence, the one I'd shown the tech.

                            TOWING ENFORCED

    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATOR'S EXPENSE

His reply, much like his actions which kicked this off, was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense. ""I only parked there for, like, ten minutes!""

""And that's all they needed to take the car,"" I replied, flipping over to the phone's last location in Google Maps, which, when looked at via satellite view, was the towing company's storage lot. ""As of ten minutes ago, your phone was there, and I daresay you'll find the tablet and keys there too.""

His father glared at him.

The cop glared at him.

He glared at me.

I breathed on my fingernails, then buffed them on my button-down. ""So, phone found, tablet found, car found, universe saved, crisis averted. But just in case - next time, park in the appropriate areas.""

Today one of the sales guys comes to me and says that people can't hear him on his company mobile phone. He can ring people and they can hear him fine but when they call him and he's the one answering, the sound is muffled and quiet on both ends. 

So while he's standing in the office I ring his mobile phone and sure to god he picks the phone up, answers it and places it to his ear *the wrong way round*. Microphone was completely covered by his meaty fist and all the things required for a working phone call pointing in the opposite direction of his face.

lawtechie,45,135,1qts9b,676,"My first tech support gig was at an advertising agency. Mad Men it was not. 

For some reason, the office park had unreliable power- we'd have 1-5 minute shutdowns at least weekly. Ironically, we were less than a mile from the headquarters for the regional power company. 

So, to fix our intermittent power problems, we put an UPS in every cubicle. The artists got these serious 50 lb systems since they had 20"" CRTs. 

Regular users had some APC brick about the size of a shoe-box. 

One of my end-users, a female account executive sends in a ticket:

AE: Every time I have a presentation due, my PC shuts down randomly. Can someone please fix my broken PC?

So I look at her machine. Nothing's _obviously_ wrong with the PC or the UPS. I open her presentation on my PC. It's not corrupt or infected. No infections on her PC. 

All the cables under her desk are tight and velcro-tied, so there's no way she's inadvertently yanking power. 

Since we were slow with replacing batteries in the UPS, I suspect a weak battery. I swap out her UPS and close the ticket.

A week later, another ticket from AE.

AE: Please, please fix my PC! I had another presentation due today and it just powered off!



So I run up. Her manager and my manager are trying to figure out how incompetent, lazy and stupid I am. 
I absolutely can't replicate the problem. She's convinced her PC senses that she's got last minute work to do and it hates her. Her PC only shuts down when she's got a presentation on that day. I'm stumped but swap out _everything_- her PC, monitor, keyboard and UPS and make a note of it on the ticket. I'll check back with her daily.

Two days later, she calls me. It's done it again. I tell her not to do anything and I'll be right up.

She's furious. I can't let this one go, so I ask her to go back to what she was doing. 

I finally figure it out and start laughing. 

I ask her if she only wears high heels on presentation days. She does. 

I point out that she uses the UPS as a foot rest. When she's barefoot or wearing flats, the plastic ridges on the side of the on/off rocker switch on the UPS prevent the switch from being hit. 

When she's wearing heels, the heel is narrower than the switch and protectors, allowing her to hit the off switch long enough to power down the system. The spring tension in the switch moves it back into ON position by the time anyone comes back to investigate.

She starts laughing herself. I make a cardboard cover for the switch and she goes back to work.

sharpie32,60,161,1qqw7h,447,"So I was talking about my student loans in /r/explainlikeimfive/ and I briefly brought up my first work experience.  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion (unrelated, but how fukkin' cool would that be.)

I started the job as a ""Security Intern"", which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions, but also meant I got to do audits of the University.  It was unpaid, but it was ""relevant work experience"" that I knew I would desperately need.  This was fine, because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with.  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs.  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games.  Some of them had Autodesk.  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth.  During that time there, I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them.  If one went dark, I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware related.

This was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the ""Security Technician"", essentially my boss and getting paid, was quitting.  He hadn't graduated yet, but had a better job lined up.  Guess who got the bump up?  This guy.  $11/hour to do the same shit I was already doing.  FuckyeahSeaking.  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth.  I could pretty much make up my own hours.  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin' down.  I wasn't building the images or doing the complex stuff, but the IT Arch-wizards were glad I was there.  I allowed them to focus.  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paid.

All great things do eventually go sour though.  (And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet.)  I walked in another day and there was something wrong.  It wasn't the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server...  It was different.  You could smell it in the air.  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin.  (I own that name OldSpice, fuck you.)  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin, who was my boss now, was changing his grades.  Now, you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin?  Well, because that's how you do it when you're a diploma mill!  Who can you pay less than one of the students you're supposed to be educating?  Well anyways, he didn't deny it and he could've got away with it if he hadn't become too greedy.  But alas, guess who got bumped up again?  Not this guy, actually.  No one did.  Which was okay, because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything we'd need for at least a little while.  So life went on with one less friend, because he left mid semester and never actually graduated.

Now's the best time to tell you about the IT Staff.  There was J, who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security.  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than I'll ever know.  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasn't a foreign national.  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells...  (Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system.)  Finally, there was M.  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled.   ""But that's all?"" you ask?  Yes, these 3 guys managed a University of too many.  They did it alone.  They did it entirely without thanks.  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much, but they believed they were making it a better place.  They thought that if they weren't there, then who would protect the neckbeards?  Certainly not their parents...  They paid for them to be here.  To get them out of their basement.  There *was* also the IT Manager, R.  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew.  He had a lot of other roles to fill, but he trusted J, S, M, and I and so we were largely unmanaged.  It was how we survived and it was how the school survived.

One day, sitting with us in our circle of chairs, R just slammed his fist down, stood up and said ""I don't usually do this, but unless any of you object, I'd like to bring Sharpie32 on full time.""  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life.  By the end of the day, there was a contract on my seat.  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit.  I was sad, but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life.  **$32k/year.**  (FYI: happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together.  They are not peanut butter and jelly.  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste, but not jelly...)

Shortly after him, S &amp; J quit as well.  I'm pretty sure R knew they would quit too, but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing.  I don't remember who had a job lined up first, but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together.  This was mostly because of politics, but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation.  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone, with thousands of students and staff depending on them.  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff, things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it.  Sick of not being paid enough (I found out later they made $45k/year each there.  Both had put in 3 years at least, never a raise or vacation.)  Sick of the disrespect;  we'd have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair.  We would have to drop everything, no matter how serious, and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why, fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot.  There were also days, once a month, where we'd be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought.  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned.  (As a footnote:  If they'd known that one day a few years into the future, they'd be lined up (literally) and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered, I'm sure they would've done things different...  But anyways.  I couldn't get fired, because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure, the network, and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty.  So at least we had that going for us, which was nice.

Things really started going down hill close to Christmas time though... that's when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons.  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP.  Windows 7 was coming out and our image, which I didn't know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems, was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it, because of the servers, because of the network.  I made the decision to drop Ghost, mostly because I hated Symantec, but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M$ tokens supported.  Keep in mind, I didn't know dick about doing this.  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in 2 months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows 7 environment.  But also in that time, I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hog.

Why was the Windows 7 shitty?  Well partly because I was still learning, partly because we were using roaming profiles, and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images, discovering if you didn't set the skipRearm flag before you sysprep'd an image 3 times, you irreversibly fucked your image.  Seriously, when Windows 7 first came out, that was pretty much undocumented.  I remember when it started getting cold.  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty.  I remember it reaching 32 in there and I sent M a text, saying ""Hey man.  I'm freezing in here.  I have a jacket but I'm still really cold, my feet are numb.  Can you call maintenance, I can't find their number.""  He sent me back ""lol.""  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline, I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happen.

So can you imagine being 20, being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before 300 computers, starting to image them all and knowing, just fukkin' knowing that if this didn't work, that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but **everyone's** day.  You'll never guess what didn't work.  (Spoiler:  Pretty much everything.)  It took 8 hours to image 40 systems of the thousand we had, because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network, each one was being handled unicast, creating its own link to the server, creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file.  I felt really fuckin' clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit.  But never the less, shit did not work.  Shit did not work for a long time.  At first it was that no one could log in.  I fixed that, it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile they'd pull based on what the system was supposed to be.  Then it was all of the undocumented ""bandaids"" that had been wiped away in XP.  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start &gt; Fucking Computer, because they were Babyboomers and change scared them.  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldn't use Windows 7.  I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition.  Which, believe me, can be a lot if you're not up for figuring it out yourself.  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground, an undocumented network and server infrastructure, and updates that had to be done manually.  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons, because it wasn't worth the drive home.

Shit was still fucked up around Valentines day.  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though.  They fucking should have though.  I would have, if I wasn't me...  They didn't give a shit though.  They could still play video games and that's all they ever needed.  Valentine's day was important to me, because the staff and faculty fuckin' rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick.  (For the record, popcorn comes in 4 sizes: Small, Medium, Large, My Dick.  You get the idea.)  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands.  One pissed off day a few months later, I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig.  She found out and sewed that shit back together.  I wish I'd taken that pig when I left...

Things eventually settled down though.  I persisted, overcame, and continued to do the best I could.  They were worried about the security of the systems, and they fuckin' should've been, so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends.  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him, who I'll call D, M and Sharpie32.  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real strides.

Then one day they hired a new IT Manager.  That was pretty much when things started going down hill.  I could've survived and probably would've stayed there a lot longer if they hadn't brought this guy on.  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on.  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being.  And so he did.  This guy gobbled the President's balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy.  Anything the President wanted, this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience.  None at all.  Guy didn't know dick about management, so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done.  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos.  He ruined that shit for me.  Not that I liked it that much, but I went from ""Meh"" to unconditionally hating that shit.  He'd talk about wanting to ""bang"" her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice, which was his real voice.  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid.  (A kid that looked like a Nair'd chimp by the way.)  Eventually, they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter.  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I won't go into detail about.  Guy didn't know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter.  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable, which was fine, but the guy was making more than twice my wages.

Needless to say, shit got pretty tense in there.  M, D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didn't like it.  Of course, they let go of the guy they could to make a point.  They shit canned M.  I was furious, but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job.  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present.  Universally, up until the new IT Manager, we were all huge gun enthusiasts, M especially.  He found zen in the long distance shot.  He owned a rifle that I've long since forgotten but was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum.  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his going-away present:  The opportunity to shoot a ""grill size"" full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

So of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning.  Got there at 3AM, had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there, it was still pitch black.  Stars look different when there's no light pollution to fuck with your night view.  

**EDIT 1:**  So anyways, we're out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and he's stoked and I'm stoked and I walk it about 150 yards out to the side of a giant hill.  You don't know terror until you're out in the wilderness 150 yards away from the only light, which is a truck's low beams.  There's just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out.  But anyways, I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didn't want to get eaten by a bobcat or something.  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back...  Terrified.  I get back there and M's like...  dude, where'd you put it?  I look back and it's too fuckin' dark to see it.  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and there's a glowstick in there.  I walk out, tie that shit on, and finally get back.  M's already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back.  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this, I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab.  What felt like an hour was probably 30 seconds as M zeroed in, prone, and took his shot.  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death.  At first you could see it spin because of the light, but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off. That's when, for the second time that night, I discovered what terror really is.

It sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to take-off speed, but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably 40 or 50 feet to the right, from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again.  It did this two more times toward us, during which I truly thought it was intentional, but finally died down.  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned, I looked down and M was still prone.  He'd never moved.  He just, in the epitome of alpha male badassery said ""cool.""  We both walked out to get it, partly because you don't leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up, but also because he wanted to show his 8 year old daughter.  He said she loved this kind of stuff.  We shot some targets after that, then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind.  That was the last time I actually saw the guy.",Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown; or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired.,608
shadymanny,45,69,1qtv92,399,"Some years ago, I was assigned to a consulting gig in NJ for a large utility company.  Not really happy about it as I am from NYC, but whatever. I had gone in as a Citrix consultant, setting up a farm to serve up their apps.  While there I was to work with a very large, national IT consulting company.  The IT company was handling everything else, routers, switches, WAN and their Novell network.  

As I was setting up my farm, the network was really slow.  I took it up with the project manager of the IT company.  He was so confused.  I asked to look at his configurations.  Being a master CNE at the time, I pretty much noticed everything they did wrong.  Within a few hours, the network, WAN, Novell servers all flying...The CIO noticed and came down to talk to me.  

CIO asked me (a 24 year old punk at the time), to take over as project manager, ousting the very, very senior project manager of the IT company.  I took this seriously and went about undoing everything they had done incorrectly.  

Before long, the project was going great--everything worked well.  My company was pleased at the additional billable hours, the IT company was happy I bailed them out.  The CIO asked for another project, of which I can't recall, but happily obliged to help.  I also hinted he should replace the other IT company and bring in more people from my company.  So the CIO calls a meeting and starts to cut back on the large IT company's staff.

I go outside to smoke cigarette and bask in the glory of my coup d'état, when I spot something I had never seen before: a chipmunk.  Being from NYC, to me this was a mythical creature seen only in cartoons.  So I start to chase the chipmunk so I can get a better look.  I chase it furiously for a few minutes until it outruns me.  I turn around and notice the CIO had been watching me, his golden child chasing a rodent around the parking lot/garden.  The disappointment in his face spoke volumes.

The year was 1995. 

Clinton was gearing up for his re-election campaign, the Bojinka Plot was exposed due to a chemical fire, the Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated, and the Tokyo subway was attacked with sarin gas by Aum Shinrikyo.

However, as these are irrelevant to our story, we'll skip that and go straight to Houston, Texas, where an eleven-year-old fifth grader was headed to school with a rather hefty book in his backpack, one that most people his age wouldn't even begin to comprehend, let alone bother to pick up. He looked forward to the day of schoolwork, despite being bullied by his peers for being different and nerdy, and the many Macintosh computers at his school were an escape for him. System 7.5 had been released the semester before, and it had been installed across nearly every machine at the school.

""Number Munchers, Oregon Trail, Carmen Sandiego, OutNumbered, and Treasure MathStorm. Games all morning!"" he thought to himself as he walked in the school's front door and headed to his classroom. He picked up the copy of the Houston Chronicle that had been delivered to the school that day (20 to a classroom - some educational program paid for it), took out the front, local, business, and lifestyle sections, then snuck down the hall to the teacher's lounge.

Technically, he wasn't supposed to be in there. However, when it was the only room to get even halfway decent coffee...

Well, a detention would be worth it.

He retrieved a styrofoam cup of coffee, headed for the door...

He almost made it.

""What did I tell you about coffee?"" The computer teacher chuckled as she came through the door and took the boy's coffee, his disaffected grumbling not stopping her as she ruffled his hair. ""You'll stunt your growth!""

""Aw, come on, please?"" the boy replied, looking up at the woman with innocent doe eyes. ""It just tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papers!""

""I thought I told you last week,"" she replied with a smile. ""Don't be in such a hurry to grow up. You'll get there eventually, and you'll always wish you'd spent more time as a kid.""

""The kids are stupid,"" he grumbled. ""They don't know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail. They don't know how to catch Carmen. They keep asking me how to use the Fodor's guide! They can't even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zapped.""

The teacher knelt. ""Not all kids are like you, you know. Some are lucky, some aren't quite as lucky. Either way, don't complain. Just help them if they get stuck.""

""Fine, Ms. D.,"" he muttered. ""Can I PLEASE have my coffee? I have stocks to check.""

She shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage. ""I don't want to know just why you're doing that.""

He scampered off, coffee and newspaper in hand.

**LATER THAT DAY...**

- - - - -

After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment, the boy was tired of it. He went into his sanctuary, the computer lab, and sat down at one of the Macs, then started a game of Number Munchers.

A pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard, causing him to look up in annoyance. ""Hey! Cut it out!""

The boy's malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard, causing the Troggle to eat his Muncher.

""What'd you do that for?""

""You're stupid,"" the girl sneered at him. ""You're a nerd and we all hate you. Go back to the school you were at before!""

Quiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him, but before he could say something, or do something, the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulder.

""Ahem. You know you're not supposed to say things like that, right?""

""Sorry,"" the girl apologzed, quite insincerely.

""Get to your lunch break. You're not allowed in here right now. If I catch you acting like that again, you don't get to play games in here for a month.""

After the girl walked out, the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed. ""Look, they're going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourself.""

""I know,"" he muttered quietly. ""I just don't know what to do.""

""Just don't hit her. It's not nice, and boys don't hit girls."" The teacher walked off, and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started reading.

**THAT EVENING...**

- - - - -

The boy was in heaven.

His mother worked for the county teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights, and sometimes, if his father was working late, his mother would bring him and his sister along with her, but she left them with the childcare crew... which, a lot of the time, took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in it.

After a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego, the boy returned to reading his massive tome, and an idea struck him, one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentor.

Fortunately, there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening, and the machine he went to was unoccupied.

After a few quick looks around, he slipped a floppy disk into the drive, and opened up a single program on it. He flipped through pages in the book, occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger, clicking and typing the whole way, performing a veritable ritual on the machine, one with an unclear finish.

An hour later, he ejected the disk, shut the machine down, and went back to his book.

When his mother took him and his sister home, he felt a deep satisfaction, knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period.

- - - - -

**THE NEXT DAY...**

- - - - -

""Okay, kids,"" the teacher called out loudly. ""Go to your assigned computers, sit down, turn it on, and get ready. Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm. Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skills.""

The boy went to his machine, complied with the teacher's request, and began playing. A short while later, the bully raised her voice.

""Ms. D! The computer isn't working!""

The teacher got up and went over, double-clicked Macintosh HD... and the Trash Can opened. She closed it, reopened it, and the same thing occurred. She opened the Trash... and Mac HD opened, with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documents.

""Huh. Well, I'll have to fix this. It'll take a while."" She looked around, and there were no machines free. ""Well, there's no computers available, so you're going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math. Sorry.""

The boy smiled to himself at his workstation, and when the class went to its next period (lunch), he went over to the teacher, who'd had no time at all to work on the machine.

""Um, Ms. D? Can I help you fix the computer?""

She shook her head. ""I don't think so. This isn't something someone like you would know how to fix.""

""I think I kind of do know how to fix it, Ms. D. Can I at least try, please?

She shrugged and gestured to the machine. ""Be my guest.""

Twenty minutes passed, and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while. The teacher had stopped what she was working on, and went over to watch the boy at work.

""So... someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon?"" She stroked her chin. ""And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can, then renamed them to each other?""

""I think that's what happened,"" the boy said, a huge grin on his face.

She smirked and tousled his hair. ""And I suppose that that's going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroom?""

""I don't think so, Ms. D,"" the boy replied quietly. ""I only think I'm going to do it if she picks on me again."" He looked up in alarm at his faux pas. ""I mean, um... I just told on myself, didn't I?""

The teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his ear.

""Told on yourself for what?""

The boy looked up... and a smile was on his face.

""Come on. I think I've got a few things to teach you,"" the teacher said, beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer room's storage room. ""I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here, and I think you're the right kid to do it, Jack.""

pyro-genesis,27,53,1qy4nn,311,"I used to be one of two onsite technicians at a combination college/animation studio/office block. This particular tale takes place a week before students are due to start arriving for the year.

The other tech (who we'll call B) and I were busy imaging a classroom full of computers for the incoming animation students. Various other teachers and staff members were working on different parts of the site, directing workmen and making last-minute changes. I was playing MP3s from the student server on the other side of the site where the students kept their files (some of them had good music and I had access to everything...) when the music suddenly stopped. At the exact same moment B said ""That's odd, I lost the connection to the mail server.""


10 seconds later all the PCs in the room started reported that they were unable to reach the image file that was on a different server, but happened to be in the same room as the mail and student server. The phone rang.

""It's *user* from the office. Everyone's internet stopped working.""


B and I exchanged glances. He raced for the door, I sauntered casually because I cared less than he did.


The server room was located in a closet at the back of the student library. When we got to the server room it was quiet. Too quiet. There was no power, and the UPS battery was utterly dead. I stuck my head into the library, where I spotted a guy wearing a fluorescent shirt and a tool belt filled with electrician-looking things.

Me: ""You didn't happen to turn the power off did you?""

Electrician: ""Yea, *college manager* wanted extra power outlets in here, so I had to rewire the breaker box. He told me no one was using the library until next week.""

Me: *facepalm* ""How soon do you think you can get it back on?""

Electrician: ""I've just spent half an hour pulling it to bits, it'll take me at least two hours to get all this back together.""


The UPS had kept everything running just long enough for him to inflict maximum damage on the breaker box. Figures.


Me: ""... ok. HEY B! Go tell *college manager* what he's done. Then take his credit card, we need 300 feet worth of extension cords.""",He told the electrician what now?,364
lawtechie,21,53,1r15nt,286,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",339
Shadowlady,27,56,1r046v,278,"First of, I'm not sure if this is the right sub, as it's not your typical Tale from Tech support, it's more shocking than funny, but I need to share it! Also I wouldn't mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similar

Backstory, I do outsourced tier 2 IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide. 

Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in, but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter. 

Let's call the user Dave.
Dave had been chasing this already, calling repeatedly and stressing our level 1 out. I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately, calm him down by letting him know I'm on it. That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with 10+ updates to find all the relevant bits of information. 


That didn't work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates. So instead I caught Dave's wife, a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop. I sheepishly apologized, explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had. She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it. In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket, so I thanked her for her help, told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didn't work I would call her back. 

The number worked but Dave was not picking up. I left a Voice mail and went to work. Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it. A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully. I tried to call Dave again but still no answer. It was nearing the end of the work day and I didn't want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something, thinking his issue was not resolved yet. 

So I called Dave's wife to tell her that just in case he calls her, let him know he can go home, the issue is resolved. 

Then Dave's wife drops this on me: there has been a **major explosion** at the gas refinery Dave works at, 2 people were killed and another is missing. **She hasn't been able to reach Dave either.** I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what we're speaking about. (They don't speak Dutch, so they can't understand)

Dave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife. I'm completely stunned, I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery. Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and that's why he didn't reply. 

The moment I hang up I get a message from first line: Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me. He just wants to know if his laptop is working.

squigglechicken,72,48,1r2ucm,267,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

**TL;DR** - Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from $40,000 in repairs.","Magnets, THAT'S how they work.",315

I was assigned to the London office to write Unit Trust software for investment banks but as they weren't ready for me yet I was placed in the IT department where for three weeks I would be imaging PCs and swapping out faulty network cards.

There were 5 of us new recruits in total, each fresh from office supplies carrying boxes full of stationery, including paper clips, pads, pens, scissors, post-its and a stapler.

The head of IT went through our instructions and told us about fire safety and the usual things you are told in an induction. 

During the induction I decided to play with the stapler, including loading it and then testing it...... on my thumb. 

As a staple went it to my thumb I didn't make a noise because I didn't want to disturb the guy who was speaking but he had seen it. He also watched in dumbfounded silence as one of his new recruits spent the next few minutes removing the staple buried deep into his skin.

Blood was spurting from the wound and to disguise the fact that I was in pain and that anything was happening at all out of the ordinary I put the thumb into my mouth to stem the blood flow. 

Now the bemused manager was facing a guy, who had performed an act of self harm, sucking his thumb like a small child who had just been sent to the naughty spot.

And the final nail into the coffin was when I decided the blood had not stopped flowing and so I decided to wrap it in a screen wipe (full of chemicals).

SirEDCaLot,53,41,1r4i39,230,"This takes place several years ago.  I'd just been hired by a small independent IT firm.  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

-----

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:** This is EDC (first name), how can I help you?

**Caller:**  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot (first and last name) at $company?  (she knows my name and extension...)

**Me:**  Yes it is!  What can I do for you today?

**Caller:**  Well I'm having a problem with my Apple Silver computer it's probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card (impossible, my cards didn't exist yet) and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thing?

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Caller:**  ...blah blah blah...So I really don't know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and he's on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library (remember she has a Mac) and I'm almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire me?

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

Epilogue:  Boss wasn't too impressed with my IM (ignoring customers = bad), but seemed to understand my explanation.  We both felt bad for the woman but there's not much we could do to help, we couldn't afford to sit on the phone for hours.

The woman called back two weeks later, seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation, but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy, and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone (her first cell phone ever).  

The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a several-minute-long voicemail.  I forwarded it to the boss, who (after listening for 30 seconds) called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment... heh

pyro-genesis,23,30,1r1kgu,228,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

I no longer work there. I'm much happier.",If you'd spent a fraction of that on prevention...,258

Me: ""OK, I think I know what the issue is. Are you currently in the room? ""

Her: ""yes I am.""

Me: ""Good. I would like you to look behind the computer and see if you can locate a wire with a green tip.""

Her: ""Oh there are so many wires back here. ""

Me: ""That's OK. We are just looking for the green tip in particular. Do you see it? ""

Her: ""Yes, I found it! ""

Me: ""excellent. Do you see a green circle in the back of the computer? ""

Her: ""yes""

Me: ""is the green tip in the green circle? ""

Her: ""no. ""

Me: ""can you put the green tip in the green circle? ""

Her: ""this is all too complicated. Can you send a tech?""

*headdesk*

Me: ""yeah. I'll be there in a few""

effingWitchDoctor,43,37,1r6dl6,193,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

shiny_charizard_,54,48,1qx9zc,168,"I could probably retire by now. Especially when customers like this make me repeat myself five times. I try my best to be crystal clear when I tell them we don't have their files, but some of them seem to think that if they just keep bugging me about it, I'll magically find them hiding in a corner somewhere.

Background: Site hosting tech support. It goes like this. Customer gives us money. We give them storage space. When it comes time to renew, we send them a bunch of annoying emails saying something like ""hey we're gonna take your money, mmkay?"" and if we try to take their money and the payment fails (expired card, wrong security code, insufficient funds, etc) then we send them a bunch more emails saying ""hey we couldn't get your money, so that means you're not paying for data storage anymore... if you want to have sites on our servers, you gotta pay bro"" and if they still don't pay for their data storage, we deactivate their account. Their sites go offline for 3 weeks with an error that says to contact tech support. If they still don't do that, after 3 weeks of expiration, all files are deleted. If you didn't back up your files, you're a moron. INTERNET RULE #1: IF A FILE MATTERS TO YOU, HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF IT ON DIFFERENT HARD DRIVES. Whether this is your PhD thesis paper, or your website, make multiple copies of it so in case someone steals your hard drive, or a typhoon swallows your computer whole on your trip to the Phillipines, or if your account expires on a paid data storage service, you have another copy of it somewhere. 


Disclaimer: Personally I think we should keep data longer than that, but that data starts piling up fast, so I guess I can't really argue with that policy. They're not paying anymore, they're not a customer. Not my policy, not my rule, I'm just paid to deliver the bad news.

Something else people fail to understand: just because once upon a time we had a backup, it doesn't mean we will permanently have that data always and forever.

This poor sap submits an email about his account. 

**Him: ""My account was expired but I paid for it. But there's nothing there.""**

Me: ""Your account and all of it's files, databases, emails, backups, etc were deleted after 3 weeks of expiration, on [date]. You'll need to upload all of your files to the server again as we no longer have any data to restore.""

**Him: I didn't know this would happen. Last time my account expired you restored it. What can I do?** *looks like it probably wasn't expired for 3 weeks so when he renewed it, there were still backups*

Me: ""You can start new websites for your domains. We kept your data for 3 weeks after it expired but you failed to renew it quickly enough. All data, including backups, are deleted. On [expiration date], when it expired, we actually threatened to delete all data within 48 hours. However it looks like we did not, we kept it for 3 weeks. But you did not renew quickly enough."" *I also quoted the email which, surprise surprise, tells you that we're gonna delete your files if you don't renew your account*

**Him: I don't use that email account, so I didn't see this message. The files were deleted recently. You have some backup?. Please help me. I need those files. My clients have no backup. I'm desperate. Please help me. I await your response.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore. If you do not use that email address, it is your responsibility to update the email address on file to one you do use to make sure you receive important notices on your account. We kept your data for 3 weeks past it's expiration. All data was permanently deleted on the [deletion date]. We do not have any backups whatsoever that we can restore.""

**Him: ""I understand that. But a few months ago my account expired and you restored it.""** *doesn't change the fact that I've repeated myself 4 times in saying I don't have any files, whatsoever, that I can restore from a backup...*

Me: ""Your data has been permanently deleted, after your account was expired for 3 weeks. There is nothing further we can do.""

**Him: This time it was the same. It had been over three weeks and could be restored.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore.""

*As if telling him 5 times that we do not have any backups to restore, he opened up a live chat with another one of our technicians just to hear it from someone else.

dazvn,34,25,1r01m2,165,"I do tech support for a fruit phone, I get a never ending series of *special* people all day long...

Today I had someone who blew my mind in terms of not listening and general twattery

Anyway I manage to persuade him to troubleshoot, we restart the router and the phone, still nothing, reset the settings on the phone, still the same.

During all the above I continually asked him if he was SURE he had the correct wi-fi password, yes of course I do I CAN read you know?

36 minutes into the call and I tell the guy I'm going to need him to speak to the internet company as there is something wrong with the router, guy goes nuts with me, I ask him one more time to go and check the wi-fi password written on the router and make sure it is what he is putting in (must be like the 7th time I asked)

F4U5T,36,39,1qy0uq,164,"X-post from a comment I made on a gaming subreddit. Was told it fits here.

So a few years back at Gamestop, I sold a brand new xbox 360.(NOT THE USED P.O.S.)  Like next week he comes in and of course I happen to be working. Im thinking red ring at this point as this was just before the redesign....Nope.

The conversation/event goes as follows to the best from my memory. My manager even filled in a few parts that I forgot.

Put this image into your mind before reading the conversation... I am a 140lb skinny white teen trying to calm down a 250lb super pissed off black man. He was chill last week... 

Me: Hey, welcome to gamestop.
(At this point I knew it was gonna be interesting as he didn't respond, stared me down, and proceeded to slam the 360 box on the counter.)

Mr. T: Yo, ya'll sold me a roach-box.
(Im calling him Mr. T just cause his build, haircut, and anger)

Me:Roach-box? Does it turn on? When it turns on is there any kind of red lights displayed on the power button, or does the power supply have a light that changes? (Im about to just take it out of the box and test in myself cause this wasn't going anywhere)

Mr. T: IDK ABOUT THAT SHIT, YALL SOLD ME A MOTHERF*CKIN ROACH BOX (My manager hears this going down and comes over to help, about once a month people go fucking mental in gamestop so its kinda the norm.)

So my manager and I open the box, and it smells pretty rank. (Not to be confused with dank, wasn't that kind of roach-box)

I'm thinking to myself wtf happened in 1-2 weeks to make this thing smell like someone took a dump in the CD tray. The female employee working with us at the time (for only 3 days so far I might add) ran to bathroom to vomit and forgot that only the manager has the keys...yeah it was frantic rush, but I digress.

So I reluctantly remove the xbox from the packaging to test and inspect. 
As I am doing that my manager makes some progress with Mr. T

Mr. T: THERE ARE GOD DAMN COCKROACHES IN THE XBOX

Now I've heard of roaches in electronics, but never seen it in person, let alone 1-2 week old xbox 360. Ok so now the inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued. I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number. Check. Get gloves from the back room. Check. I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fine.

So I plug this smelly P.O.S. into our test unit, turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction. There other people in the store (minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed), so it was like 'Whack a mole' on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it. Honestly we didn't get them all. Now knowing what a roach box is, my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we don't want to. 

Mr. T: See ya'll sold me a roach-box. 

Manager: Do you by chance have a problem with roa...

Mr. T: MOTHERF*CKER, ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE, MY HOUSE IS NEW, THERE AINT NO ROACHES.

I pretty much take the back seat on this one, I really don't have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it.  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed, locked in our back room, and our store was the newest in the area. There were no roaches in the store....well before the xbox was brought back there wasn't at atleast.

So he's getting more and more pissed. It's getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times, and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something. I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situation...like everyone left the store at this point cause Mr. T was gonna explode at any second. I explain the situation to the district manager who says we can't take it back, I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of sales/customers he is causing. He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it. Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard; he district manager started the customer is always right bullshit.

My manager couldn't afford to lose his job/career as he put years into getting a store.  I was about to quit and go to college full-time so I decided to just return the console under my name, still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in. It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy, etc. In the space where you say why; I wrote ""ROACH-BOX 360"" Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went. 

We made it clear to Mr. T that it was 'user error' and we fixed his fucking error. The customer is not always right. Get your house sprayed for bugs or don't live like a hoarder. 

I never got contacted about the ~$300 shrink. There are various reasons why they let it go, but thats a story on its own.

We replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times, it was just clear enough to lip read the customer. Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that. 

TL;DR  Roach-box 360. Enough said.

Tomagathericon,18,27,1quk95,146,"Bear with me please, because this needs some backstory.  
Some time ago, i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women. They had only one tech guy, and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed, so most of the less important stuff just got ignored. Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech, i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long. Word got around i made work easier for people, and soon, i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy.  
  
So, one day, one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long.  
Now, to explain this, all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS (Large Document Managing System), with different lists for each day.
In order to create a transfer history for a customer (these were usually created and billed per month), youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually (as each day was a seperate list).  

Now, youd think they would just copy what they need, paste it in a textfile, then print that file when they have everything. Nope, that would be too easy.  
Instead, what they did was print every single transfer, one by one, each on a new page, then get an empty piece of paper, cut out all the transfers they printed (this is the part where the shears come into play), glue them on the empty page, wait for it to dry, then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer. Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way.  
  
I tried to show them the magics of copy &amp; paste, and while they did notice it going much faster and easier, the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods. I believe they are still doing it this way.

My apprentice technicians were sweating mightily under the sustained incoming fire from a horrendous she-beast, who claimed that every time she used a certain computer, they would remotely shut it down on her. This was possible on some of the equipment, but only if you have the requisite access (which I surely hadn't given them) and know-how (being a heavily customized Linux system, it was not a simple thing).

A quick check of the access logs showed that was absolutely not the case.

Certain that my techs were blameless, I sallied forth into no man's land to draw the fire and see if I could not vanquish this demon back to her pit.

First thing I notice: she's not even on one of the machines that can be remotely shut down; the machine she is using is on a completely separate network specifically locked down as tight as possible for security, as it handles some classified data. So what she's describing is especially impossible.

&gt; SB: Your techs keep turning off this computer when I'm using it! It's not funny any more!

&gt; ME: I can assure you, that's absolutely NOT what is happening.

&gt; SB: Well, every time I use it, it turns off!

&gt; ME: Show me.

Now, this computer was installed in a 19' rack, with a pull out monitor/keyboard for the local user. Someone had placed a chair in front of it, but there was virtually no leg room at all. This was not an issue for the male users, who would tuck their feet back under the chair as far as possible, or just stand.

She-Beast, on the other hand, had a different approach. She twisted her legs off to the side, and proceeded to cross her legs at the knees. This became important when, after a couple of minutes, she became bored with the work she was doing and started to fidget as she continued typing.

Yes, she started to swing that raised foot back and forth a little; each time swinging closer and closer to the UPS power switch... And sure enough, eventually she hit the switch and turned off the rack.

Triumphantly, she turned to me to show me the fault... Only to find I was walking out of the room so I wouldn't have to laugh in her face.

*****

ADDENDUM: It turned out she would also sometimes hit the fuseholder next to the switch, partially dislodging the fuse. The other users would come across the fuse hanging out and just put it back in, never thinking to report the issue.

midashand,22,28,1qrsy2,130,"Hello again everyone!

In my spare time, I still do some random freelance work for friends of friends and business in the area. This was essentially how I started my IT career, but I've mostly moved on. However, there are still a few people/businesses that I still look out for when they need IT help.

A few weeks back, I get an email from local business owner, Tom. Tom says something along the lines of ""The two front desk computers keep dropping connection to QuickBooks. Can you come take a look?"" After a bit of finagling, I managed to get him to send me a ""screenshot"" of the error so I knew what I was getting into: http://i.imgur.com/djmDRfU.jpg *Ugh, this doesn't look pretty....*

The way the business is set up, Tom has his computer in the back where the sales/accounting stuff happens that uses QuickBooks multi-user mode to allow the two front desk computers to process payments and invoices as well.

It is a this point that I should mention I despise and detest QuickBooks and refuse to work directly with it. If Tom needs help specifically with it, he contacts a colleague with an accounting degree that is also tech savvy. 

Anyways, I head over after work and start digging in to see what I can find. The first suspect is the new All-In-One router that the business recently installed when they switch internet providers. I can't find anything wrong there, all the computers have (slow) internet and everything is fine.

Next suspect is Tom's computer. ""Tom"", I said, ""Has anything odd been going on with your computer lately?"" ""Any trouble with Quickbooks?""

""Nope"", hey says, ""everything's working fine. My QuickBooks never gives me any errors, its just up front. ""

After a quick Look-See myself, yep it all looks good. No abnormal behavior that i can see.

And this is where I started pulling my hair out. I tried everything I could think of. I tested the wiring, as some of it is ancient. I replaced the switch that feeds the back room Ethernet ports. I ran Cat6 all over the floor going from router to computers. I tried swapping routers. I couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with any of it.

Now, please keep in mind: I have a full time job. I am doing this work in the evenings. Tom wants to go home. I want to go home. I usually stay for an hour or so, and then come back a day or two later.

Two weeks later, I had given up. I simply couldn't find anything wrong with any of the computers or the network. I let Tom know I was at a loss and that he was probably going to have to hire some ""big guns"" to figure out what the deal was. 

I was depressed. I'd worked for this shop since before I started college. They had never had a problem I couldn't tackle. I'd burnt hours of my free time over the last two weeks trying to figure it out. With each knew idea, I thought ""Ah! Surely this must be it!"", only to be crushed beneath the weight of failure again.... I was depressed and dejected. 

A few days later (Last Monday) Tom sends me the following picture with a note, ""Hey Midashand, my computer just gave me this message this morning when I tried to turn it on and its making clicking noises"": (Yep, you know where this is going) http://i.imgur.com/HHcmLYb.png

""SWEET MOTHER MARY, TOM!!!! THAT'S THE CAUSE!!!! YOU TOLD ME YOU HADN'T BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS!!!!"" 

Since I was only there for an hour a day, I was limited in my ability to check for hardware problems without bringing the whole sales system down until the next evening when I came back. I couldn't very well leave Tom without a computer while I chased ghosts with diagnostic tools for hours on end. And truthfully, his system was behaving perfectly normal. No weird sounds, no delayed HD access, nothing. Besides, after repeated assurances from Tom that nothing was wrong, checking system hardware wasn't even on my radar. I forgot rule #1.....

""Well"", he said, ""I guess Quickbooks had been locking up every now and then... but it never gave me any errors so I figured it wasn't a big deal."" *facedesk*

A quick use of Amazon Prime landed a new hard drive on my doorstep a day later and I got to spend the ENTIRE evening installing Windows and related software. (Also, side rage note: WHY DELL!? WHY DO YOU REQUIRE A 1.5TB+ HARD DRIVE TO USE THE RECOVERY DISC!!!!) *ahem* I even managed to get most of his data off. Although his 7.5GB .PST file died a horrible death. Not even really sure what was in it.... His email is still on the server, but definitely not 7.5GB worth....

Anyways, Everything is fine now, QuickBooks is purring along... Although I'm sure its just a ruse as it contemplates its next attack.....

I explain to them that the Chromebook doesn't run Windows, won't work with their current printer, it wont play DVDs, the closest they'll come to MS Office is Google Docs and their home working software won't work. I explain that a Chromebook is designed mainly for simple web use and probably not right for their usage, and suggest maybe they take it back and exchange it.


""Can't you make it work? It's nice and shiny and it was cheap."" They plan to keep the Chromebook and ""get our IT guys at work to make it work“... Yeah good luck! They have bought an HP ePrinter though, so at least they can print, and I went back to set that up for them.


Don't get me wrong, I like the machine itself. Might even get one for out and about... But they've bought it without doing the simplest of research and it's not right for them.

Gambatte,28,15,1r0tjr,118,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

ViolentLambs,34,27,1r7gk3,125,"I went to a vocational school for three years (10th-12th grade) and I took electronics and robotics. A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK! The perfect place to dispose of these creatures from hell. I took the bag and opened every pouch and shook it hard. I swear there had to be like 80of these things running around. They were of various sizes and some were faster than others but I put the bag down and went to the laptop. Powered it off took it apart and surprisingly there wasn't that many in there maybe 4-5. Cleaned up the laptop the best I could and left the laptop bag out (I remembered to take the charger out and it didnt rain it was a warm night) on the dock and the next day it was empty and smelled fresh and clean even though it used to be a bugs home. Installed windows seven and happily took the PC to its owner in computer office technology.

I don't know that client didn't notice or at least check for those roach things.. That was the first time I ever encountered something like that. My instructor wasn't too pleased that I left his bag out there but as happy that we didn't get some kind of infestation or something..

RoninSpartan,17,29,1r251v,112,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

Gambatte,19,22,1qy5wl,96,"Earlier this year, a new ticketing system was implemented. Good times. The CEO was enamored of this cloud based system, and would not be dissuaded.

One of the first tickets he raised (in fact, the seventh ticket ever raised on the new system) was a fairly large change in the functionality of one of the data handling applications, which meant that in certain situations, some of the messages that were previously generated would instead be suppressed. The ticket was later enlarged to suppress a second group of messages; all of which was emailed to and approved by the CEO.

A few weeks after the change went live, the CEO suddenly charged up to my desk at great speed, wildly flinging excrement in all directions:

&gt; CEO: Holy crap! I just had [client] on the phone and they didn't get [first group message]! This is a major failure on our part! The company could be liable... We'd have to close the doors, fold the company if they get the lawyers involved.

Zehnpae,17,15,1r05kc,90,"I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician.  Going into businesses and people’s homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is.  You just can’t explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of semi-nude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PC.

As with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder, “Is this job really worth it?”

I’ve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goes.

I spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech. This was back in late 90’s, early-naughties (double-0’s?) when it was still a bit of an oddity.  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger.  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster, cheaper and without them having to leave the house?  It was no contest.

My schedule got busy pretty quick. I would get asked for by name more often than not.  I had adventures, every day was an adventure.  I collected stories like pokemon.  Stories of delight, terror and everything between.  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story.  The one that haunts you in your waking dreams.

I pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon.  I’d worked that trailer park before.  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad.  This particular trailer had the mandatory 2 plastic lawn chairs, area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

I checked my collar, knocked on the door and waited.  After a few moments your standard old lady, let’s call her Betsy, answered the door.  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed, ‘Oh you’re that geek guy! Come on in.’

I took a step inside the door, felt a crunch, took another step, felt another crunch.  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked on.

Kitty litter.

I glanced around and found that it was everywhere.  I couldn’t actually see the floor itself.  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in.  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big ‘nope’ but I was too much the professional.  I asked her where the computer was.

Betsy smiled, either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasn’t some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where she’d chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter.  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter, not settling on top of it.

She led me down a short corridor, *crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch*.  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter, *crunch, crunch, crunch*.  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer, a relic of a long gone era.  She offered no explanation, almost no awareness of it being there.  I didn’t have the wherewithal to ask.  I’ve seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanation.

She gestured at the computer, explained that as of a few days ago it won’t turn on anymore.  I knelt down…yeah…I knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button.  Standard PC repair operations, right?  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter.  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about 3 or 4 inches deep.

The power checked out, I could charge my phone.  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable.  No dice.  No spin, nothing.  I then made my third big mistake of the day.

I opened the case up.

You know how when you pour kitty litter there’s that dust that flies into the air?  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time?  If it had been cocaine I’d be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning.  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life.  At that point there wasn’t much keeping me going either.

I explained, to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice, that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had.  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one.  I thanked her and then left.

It was until I was outside swearing to myself, wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadn’t seen a single cat.

lawtechie,21,23,1r39ta,90,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat.

smeltofelderberries,14,13,1qs7vg,90,"I'm a college student with no formal tech training. However, I enjoy computers and am decent at basic troubleshooting. Yesterday a friend put out a request asking if someone could disassemble a laptop. 

It turned out she had spilled water on her computer. Fortunately everything was backed up, but she had a paper to write that weekend so having her laptop would save her from having to try to get a public terminal at the library.

I carefully removed the screws on the back plate along with the battery. There were some big droplets of water in the battery area which did not seem like good news for the future of the computer. After I finished taking the screws out, we set the computer up in a partially opened position to dry both the keyboard and the bottom.

Cut to 8 hours later and we're going to try to put it back together. I reattach the screws, pop in the battery, and try to boot. Unfortunately, there is no response from the computer. I suggest plugging in the power adapter. After fiddling with the surge protector, it gets plugged in. Again, no response from the computer. As my gut begins to churn, my friend realizes that one of us bumped the off switch on the surge protector. Attempt three is a success, the computer boots, and the day was saved.

MonteCelery,6,8,1qt8e6,82,"From an appreciative customer...

Spouse and I bought a house about 3 years ago. Had the big, national cable/internet company out to install internet.  Previous owners had had cable, so we're told no problem. 
In the last 6 months, internet starts getting just a little odd.  Randomly slow, doesn't work with the microwave on, odd.  But not horrible.  Until it rained. [A lot.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Colorado_floods) 
Then the internet would completely stop for hours, and suddenly be ok for a while.  Modem checks ok, resets ok, computers all say they have access... but nothing happens. 

Call tech support, say we think it's on their end- did the flooding affect our neighborhood infrastructure?  (wouldn't be surprised, given then number of roads that washed out.)  Nope.  HMM??? Support guy comes out. 

We had antenna cable instead of cat-6 or whatever was supposed to be used from the trunk to the house.  Run *over* the roof instead of along the eaves.  And apparently the squirrels had been stealing bites of insulation.  Between the scary death rays of the microwave, the squirrels, and inundation... we were surprised to have internet at all!

Awesome tech guy fixed it in about 3 hours with new cable installed right.  We called in a thank you. ",When Noah releases the squirrels...,90
FenrisFrost,35,14,1r7yh4,87,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

Store: Hi, this is Becky(names changed) with store X, and my register 4 is shutting down randomly. Can you help me out?

I'm only to happy to assist. I ask her to check if the register is plugged into the UPS, and she confirms that no, it's just plugged into the wall outlet. 

A memory is sparked! I had assisted this store with a few other problems just yesterday, and I distinctly recall one of the ""addendum"" problems being the register was not plugged into the UPS. I'd directed the employee to plug the register into the UPS when it wasn't busy and to call back if there were complications. I have this happen from time to time, usually it's a tech coming and not leaving things setup right.

So it's a bit odd that this same register is not plugged in to the UPS. I direct Becky to just go ahead and plug the register in to the UPS, walk her through choosing the outlet for battery backup vs just surge protection. All good, she goes to turn on the register.

Nothing. No fan, drive spinning up, nothing.

Ok, weird. Maybe it's a bad UPS and that's why it was plugged into the wall. 

I checked for other tickets open for the store. Nothing there but the ticket I opened yesterday for another issue.

I had Becky check for any lights on the UPS...

She didn't see any, but did notice something strange. 

An enterprising employee had managed to discover infinite energy simply by, you guessed it, plugging the UPS *into itself*. Yeah, that could cause problems.

Becky was smart enough to realize that's no good. She told me about it and made the adjustment with no prompting from me.

We were immediately rewarded with the sound of an old register coming to a wheezy sort of life.

MrTig,13,7,1r4r98,77,"Several mini tales here in one pack, all from my days as a Tech Monkey for Multi-ISP Support.


Tale One - Thou Shall Not Steal


Mr Thief: Hi, I can't get any Internet access, what's going on?

MrTig: Okay, what's your phone number?

Mr Thief: It's not on my phone line, it's on my neighbours, he left it unsecure.

MrTig: And...you can't connect to it now?

Mr Thief: Yeah, how did you guess? 

MrTig: I suspect your neighbour didn't appreciate you stealing from him, perhaps you should consider taking out our service if you liked it that much.

Mr Thief: Don't see why I should have to, it should all be free anyway *click*

Okay hippy..


Tale Two - £1.40 is cheaper than £120


Customer calls up, instead of hitting 1 for Customer Services, he's mashed the key for us.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it. We don't set the figures, I know other ISP's charge less for the visit or have better ""deal"" with BT Openreach, but was previously mentioned small mum&amp;dad ISP's.


Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,34,8,1r518r,73,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Space_Lobster,21,29,1qxvdp,72,"It was an early morning in the winter. It was a beautiful sunny day in the neighborhood- cool, but crisp enough to be enjoyable. This one day I received this deskto- Ok, this person was about 35-40 years old and refused to listen to anything I said-was acting like a two year old on candy and coffee, and I over-charged him for parts that were found just laying around. 

As usual, I take in the desktop and I asked ""What's the problem you're having?"" The customer points to the VGA port and starts to wiggle it. The explained to me they left the computer on during a thunderstorm and their internet on the computer stopped working. I said ""ok"". Then they proceed to tell me when one of their family members went to unplug it, they yanked the monitor chord too hard and it became loose. Now I'm smiling ear to ear. I figured it would've taken one or two parts and I was done with it. (I didn't have a basic video card on hand, so I calculated about a week with shipping the part). 

I take a look at the machine and noticed right away the VGA port is extremely loose, as soon as I open up the case, and remove the motherboard the VGA piece falls right off. (This was an old mobo, no DVI) About a week later I get the part, check out the internet issue, came to the conclusion the Ethernet port really was fried as well. So of course I add a new card for the computer. (By the way, this was just laying around) As I went to turn it on to test it, I get zero response. Do a power supply test, the power supply completely dies. I called the customer to let him know they amount of work I have done, and let him know about the power supply. (The power supply also was something just laying around) 

This is how the conversation went:


Me: Hello, this is Space_Lobster calling, how are you today?

Him: Took you long enough. (Really? It was barely a week)

Me: Well, sir I had to wait on parts that were on order, unfortunately I didn't have the parts just laying around.

Him: What was the solution? (As I already discussed a day prior)

Me: I had to replace the VGA, Ethernet and Power supply. 

Him: What happened to the video thingy?

Me: It came clean off the motherboard, and there was no way for me to really save it. (When I tell you clean, I mean you can't even tell it was meant to be there, it took some force to break as clean as it did.)

Him: What?

Me: (I explained how the VGA is on-board for about 10 minutes)
Him: So it fell off?

Me: *agitated* Yes.

Him: Can't you just...you know, put it back?

Me: *Facepalm and blind-sided* No...no I cannot. The new video card is only $15. (This I legitimately ordered) 

Him: Well, why?

Me: All the tracers are completely missing, I can't do anything other than replace it, even if I were to solder it, it would cost you a lot in labor. I'm saving you a ton of money right now. 

Him: What was the other things again?

Me: The Ethernet port, or as you know it as the Internet port was fried, but I was able to replace that without any issues.

Him: *grumbling* I said my internet wasn't working, why did you REPLACE it? You couldn't just fix it?

Me: trying to keep cool There was a short from the storm on the port, I tried all I can to fix the on-board, there wasn't much I could do for you other than a new part. 

Him: Great, just trying to rip an old man off. What about the other thing you did?

Me: I replaced your supply that died. 

Him: The what?

Me: The part that makes your computer turn on.

Him:**screaming** HOW DO YOU DO THIS TO ME? I'M NOT SOME ALIEN SCUM (INSERT RACISM HERE), I'M A GOOD WHITE CHRISTIAN (INAUDIBLE) 

Me: *hang up*

Him: *calls back*

Me: The next time you scream at me, I'm taking the parts back and giving you the computer just the way you gave it to me. (I quickly amazon a random power supply, print out the page as a receipt) The power supply will cost you $59.00 (It should have only been around $23 lol) 

Him: Fine! hangs up

At this point I don't see or hear from this customer for nearly a month. Finally comes in to pick up the computer. 

Him: How much do I owe you?

Me: ""$110 for labor, $90 for part"" (I was only going to charge him $50 for the fix at first, considering it was ridiculously simple as the parts should have only been around $35-45) 

Him: Staring at me

Me: Staring back 

Him: You really know how to rip people off, Best Buy would fix it for me for free.

Me: I really doubt that. 

Him: You shouldn't have the nerve to charge me that money, considering you've had it for over a month.

Me: I called you once per week to remind you it's here, how is this my fault you didn't show?

Him: You had it over a month!

Me: (To get him out of my hair) Fine, $100 labor. I'm not taking any less. 

The guy pays me, I give him the computer (normally I'll turn it on in front of the customer to show them everything is running like new.) In this case I simply just showed him the new VGA port and the new Ethernet port that he can now use. I'm thinking it's over at this point. His last remark had to be left.

""A real tech can fix things. I'm sure a geek kid would've put the parts back like I asked.""

Me: *facepalm*

Now I deal with a professional environment, even though the attitude is so much better, the stupidity is just the same.

Tl;Dr: Old man learns the tooth fairy isn't real.

TheLightingGuy,38,20,1qwt10,71,"So to start off, this is more of a rant than anything else but you guys would easily understand my concern. A good friend and colleague of mine have taken ownership of doing church IT work as their sysadmins. Wonderful people to work with with the exception of this one who keeps forgetting her password at least once a week. But she's not my issue. So a bit of a backstory

Before I came onboard to do this, I worked under their old It guy setting up Asterisk as a phone server. The guy was pretty chill, But something seemed weird about how he did things. It never clicked until recently. About 3 months ago, he just stopped returning phone calls, stopped responding to email, and has yet to stop in. 

Then one day something magical happened. The router he had setup (Linksys WRT54G flash with DD-wrt) just crashed and lost all the settings. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that our ISP has us running on a Static IP. So naturally, my IT senses kicked in and I started working away. The day later I sent in a quote for better equipment and it was approved. We ordered a Ubiquiti Edgemax router and 3 Long Range Wireless AP's (FYI if anyone wants a recommendation for that product, Streakwave is amazing!). Once we got those in, We took DHCP off the server and had the router take care of it, Setup VLANS to separate the staff, sanctuary, guest and phone networks, got up on a scary ass lift that you'd think would tip over any second trying to put the AP's up int he Rafters, and removed the old Router and routers that were setup to be AP's. 

Now here's the fun part. We haven't dared ask the Operations Manager (oversees everything from everyone) what the deal is with the Old IT guy. But my colleague and I just had to do some more snooping. 
We've found this all so far:

* Backups have not been done for over a year due to lack of space on the backup drives
* Server only has 5 CALS when there are at least 25 staff members that connect to the domain

And for the big WHAT THE FUCK one that made the operations manager super pissed off

* Trend Micro Worry Free agent has been out of date, with an expired not working license for over a year and a half

So currently, we seem to have taken over the entire church for their needs. We also are getting ~$2500 to fix most of our IT needs during the 2014 year. And lastly, Since I'm also an A/V guy, I get to be in charge of setting up our soon to be new conference room with all the goodies needed for anything they ever need. Don't get me wrong. Working for this church (as volunteer work for free mind you) is probably my favorite thing I've done and they're easily my favorite client since they're so easy to work with. I just wish the old IT guy kept track of things better because I'm sure you're all in agreement with me that some of those things listed are just inexcusable. 

TL;DR: Old IT guy didn't keep track of things and is probably going to be fired.

pizzadudecook,18,14,1r04ca,70,"So I have never posted here before, so here we go.



I am a network admin/sys admin for a fairly large company. At headquarters we have three buildings. One for accounting and IT, one for administration and one for distribution. A little history, our distribution building has been hard to get dedicated internet access to due to its location. Instead we shoot a wireless signal over to it from the administration building to feed it internal access as well as internet. The setup has been working like a champ for a couple years without issue.



A couple weeks ago, the distribution building called, stating they were having issues accessing anything. So I go through the normal steps and check each piece of equipment in the line. They could all be reached from my desk except the AP in the admin building. After a little troubleshooting, I decide to get up and o look at the AP. Suddenly, they shout its working again and the situation is resolved.



This issue would come and go at random times for about a week. Finally when distribution called again, I dropped the phone and ran to the admin building. Now, everyone around here has the habit of turning off the lights and closing the door when they aren't in the office. So I speed down to the room this AP is located in and without thinking about knocking , I open the door because the lights are off.



As soon as I look up, sitting there is a very nice lady from marketing with her shirt wide open, and a breast pump on her chest. She was unplugging the AP to plug in the breast pump. I quickly slam the door and run back to my office to try and figure out how to diffuse this. To this day I always knock on office doors, open or closed, even if the lights are off.







TL;DR: Always knock before entering",Pumping on the clock,84
helpdesk1478,12,9,1qq8ia,72,"So this doesn't relate to my work in tech support, but it relates to my home DSL connection.  A couple of months ago we had a huge thunderstorm.  The next day, I see that our DSL modem has a red light.  Aw shucks.

So I disconnect it, plug it in at the box.  No joy.  Phone line connected to the box and as far as I can follow it back. I see no problem.  

So I call our derp ISP, A Technical Tempest.  After making me run all over doing the same things I'd just done, they said the line test failed.  Well, yeah.  I told you as much.  The fastest they would send a tech was three days.  No budging.

FenrisFrost,7,10,1r5ce7,68,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves. 

TLDR; Your first reaction shouldn't be to blame something we tested successfully for months. ",It looks like it works to me.,78
squigglechicken,5,9,1r2dr9,70,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. That's terrible.""

Lexmark Tech: ""Yeah... ummmm... call back tomorrow... I guess?""

**TL;DR** - In all seriousness, if you've got some extra money please donate to the Philippines relief effort. They've been through a lot.

Gambatte,11,8,1r406j,64,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

samurai-technician,9,8,1r1iti,62,"One of our salesmen, we'll call him Moron, asks me if I can handle an installation of an new VoIP recording system with an integration we are not familiar with.


Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.

""Did you order a rack or a tower?""


""I'm not going to order the server until the week of the install so we can maximize utilizing the warranty."" He talks like a brochure when he knows he's in trouble. Since, even when he eats lunch he's in over his head, he talks like a moron all the time.


""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in. I have no issues with dropping everything else to rush getting it configured with the OS properly installed and updated, and the new software that we have never seen or worked with before installed and configured.

Jn108,28,10,1qzlsc,59,"Howdy folks! I've been reading this sub for a while and I finally have a story to share.

A little background on me. I am the manager of a small electronics store, we are a smaller chain that consists of 3 stores. I would not consider myself an expert exactly, but I can solve most basic-advanced problems. I build my own pcs at home and troubleshoot most of my own issues.

This story starts a little way back so stick with me. An older gentleman walked in with his laptop. Now this thing was old, and I mean that. He told us it was around 20 years old, I don't think it was that bad but the base of the laptop was about 1.5'' alone and it was running XP. He was looking to get an updated machine, no problem that's what I'm here for. So we look at the available machines and we find one of our low-mid range machines that would be a perfect fit for him. He requests a data transfer, so I write it up and turn him over to the techs so they can see exactly what he wants to transfer. 

Well his computer contained the following:
1. A folder called ""Things i don't use""
2. 3 pictures in his My Documents
3. 1, I repeat 1 email in his outlook inbox.
4.About 100 contacts in outlook.

So we get the contacts and 3 pictures transferred for him. We also made sure he had the right drivers for his printer installed and that it was working. We call him to inform him his new machine is configured and ready for him. 

Well today he showed up with his wife to pick it up. They came in carrying ANOTHER laptop and printer. He went on back to talk with the techs and his wife asked me if I could figure out for her why her printer wasn't working. Now here are the important details to remember here for this part of the story. The printer was connected to the laptop via USB with cable that were labeled with things like ""printer left"", referring to the left port on the back of the printer. She did not have the power cable with it.

With that in mind, on with the story. So I open up the laptop and get it started. My first thought was to get power to this printer so that I could test it if I did get it working. I asked about the power cord, ""do you happen to have the power cable with you?""

She stared at me blankly for a moment, then dropped this:

""Ummm, I'm not sure. Its wireless?""

""Ok, but I still need power""

""Oh, well i have some other cables I grabbed out in the car, maybe I have it there.""

Awesome, maybe I'll get lucky here. Sure enough, she returns with a bag containing the power cable. Now she has me wondering if she has been thinking it didn't need power, but upon grabbing the power cable I see there is also a label on the end of this cable so at least she HAS used it in the past. So now we have the printer on, and it's hooked up to the laptop but no go.

My next thought was to check the usb plug. So I give it a little tug to make sure it's well connected and I finally found the problem. The usb popped right out...usb plugs are usually connected more tightly than that. I look at the side of the laptop and find that the place it was connected was not at all a USB port, but rather the network plug. To quote the mythbusters ""Well there's your problem!""

Moved it to the USB and BAM! The computer recognized it and test page printed successfully. 

She looked at me like I was a wizard. She asked what she owed and she was shocked when I told her nothing.

But seriously...wireless power? We aren't that advanced yet.","""I don't know, it's wireless!""",69

I get a panicked call from one of the branches that a printer has been printing out multiples of the same document over and over until the printer is shut off, and when the printer is turned back on, it keeps printing. I tell them to leave the printer off, and that I'd be right out. 

When I get there, I hear the tales of woe from the staff, and go about checking everything. I check the workstation, the print server, the release station, and ask the staff if the customer had wanted more than one copy. Nothing indicated anything out of the ordinary. 

I turned the printer on, and it proceeded to start spitting out multiple copies of the document that had been printing previously. I mashed the heck out of the Cancel Job button to stop it. I test printed a document from one of the staff computers, and the same thing happened. 

I went back to the printer and began flipping through the menus, and there it was.

PotatoRoll,31,9,1r88u6,60,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

OldPolishProverb,3,6,1r8b6k,72,"Background; I work in a college IT department. Our IT work area is one large common room. One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass. You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home. 

As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didn't like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it. He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift. I wasn't going to deal with this after a 14 hour shift. I walked away quietly and talked to his boss the next day. 

Nice guy, decent tech, solid worker, just not the fastest port on the rack.   ",I can see clearly now ...,78

SkraeNocturne,14,8,1qwt6o,50,"Bit of backstory:

There's a ""server"" at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners.  This software has a limit of about 60 connections at any given time.  This software (or at least their installation of it) has an issue with disconnecting sessions.  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline, the connection remains open in the server software, even though it has nothing to connect to.  When the scanners come back online, they open a new connection in the server software, even though their old connection is ""open.""  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers aren't running as many scanners as the client does.  A quick note, this was apparently not by design, they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed them.

So we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit, send an email to our help desk to let us know, and restart the machine.  We are getting the emails, but it's apparently not always restarting.

frozenfoxy,1,6,1r1o5q,47,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,53

lnx64,10,6,1qy8db,46,"First of all, I am saddened about the recent tornado devastation that occurred recently.  It however has reminded me of a call I had when working at a cable company, which baffled me, because the customer was so clearly uncaring of the well being of our techs.

About 3 years ago, when those tornadoes went through the midwest, I had a customer, in that area, actually call complaining that her cable TV was out.  She lost internet also, and don't think she had our phone service (she did call from a cell phone, and don't remember details.).

But anyway, this was basically how the call went.

Customer:  Hey, my TV just went out, and so did the internet!  Am I in some kind of an outage again?!
Me:  I apologize for the inconvenience this may be causing you.  Can I have your phone number to look up your account information please?
Customer:  (Gives number).
Me:  From what I see here, you are indeed in an outage, as the tornado going through your area took out many important lines that run the infrastructure of your cable network.  This will affect TV, and internet.
Customer:  Don't use the weather as an excuse!  This is terrible service!  Send a tech out immediately now!
Me:  Ma'am, I can't do that.  For safety reasons, our technicians in your area are home with their family right now.
Customer:  WHAT!?  Fix it now!
------------------
At this point, I am face palming hard.  I'm thinking, how stubborn is this lady?  Apparently a lot!  It's no excuse to be yelling at me, and constantly going back to fix it now.  So I look at the weather map, and her address on it..  Damn, the tornado is nearly right there!
------------------
Me:  Ma'am, could you do me a favor?  Can you please look out your window please?
Customer:  *mumbles something but can't hear*  Ok.
Me:  Do you see the intense weather condition out there?
Customer:  Yes, the sky is very dark, it's raining very hard, and I know, there is a tornado around here.  (Though she didn't mention she saw it.)
Me:  Ok, would you drive in this condition?
Customer:  No!  I won't even go outside of the house!
Me:  Well this is why we aren't sending a technician out right now.  It is too dangerous, and we care about our techs safety.
Customer:  But, I need my TV and internet!
Me:  Sorry lady, there's nothing else I can help you with.  I can't schedule anything, not even for tomorrow, because we don't know what it will be like in the future days.  Please give us a call back when the weather is clearer, but I can guarantee you, the fact you are in a marked outage, your area will be fixed without needing a call back.
Customer:  So you're not going to help me?

FenrisFrost,13,0,1r678j,44,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*.""

Amaltron,14,2,1r5o8x,44,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

power (battery) is removed, the  PDA obviously looses it RAM-contents.

While repairing a Palm m500 series, this happened. And the memory of this device contained 2 years
of vehicle administration. (Here in NL we need to keep record of our business-car usage, to avoid high taxes, so
this data is VERY important, because not being able to provide it, can be VERY costly TAX-wise).

Now, as a company we cannot be held responsible for users data, but it should be no problem, because
Palm, and all others provide its customers with powerful tool to back-up the devices data, in this case Palm desktop,
so a short so called ""hotsink"" will restore all data, including the sensitive and costly vehicle mileage data....
In addition, this particular model could also create backups to SD cards.....

 After the repair was complete, i returned the PDA to my customer. Het was shocked to see it was reset, and
no data was present at all. He shouted: ""All my vehicle data is lost, how are you gonna restore it?"" I replied: ""well,
your hotsync backup should do the trick. Simply put it in the cradle, and press a button. All you data will be restored in minutes!""

Turn out he never synced his device. Really never. He filed a complaint with his boss Vincent,  who paid for the repairs.
His boss was furious. Not to us, but to the employee.  Vincent mailed me a day later to tell me about the complaint, it turned out
that the owner of the PDA, was employed as an IT professional, and in particular was responsible for the company file server and the backups.

Near the end of my shift, I get one last call from a younger woman who needs help getting several devices connected.

The first is a PS3. Its already connected to the network, has internet access, but it can not access the PSN. Being the nice gal I am, I decide I'd grab the ports for her.

I ask her to grab the IP address of the PS3 from the network config, and she's able to do it without any hitch. *SURPRISE*

No luck getting connected to the PSN. I decide to make sure its not the leased gateway causing any issues, so I DMZ the Playstation and have the CX restart it. When it boots, I ask to check the IP address again (DHCP and all). Same one, DMZ still valid. STILL unable to connect to PSN. Tell CX she's out of luck on that one. Tell her to try again when Sony's network isn't so congested. (Forums revealed problems)

Kataclysm,25,5,1r2eke,38,"I work in IT. I've been involved professionally for going on seven years now, and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on 20. I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.

recon1991,4,13,1qxvn8,38,"Been following TFTS for a couple months now.  Love it all! First time posting here and not even sure this is all that funny.

**Background:**
I work as an IT Administrator for a non-profit organization .  As such, people think IT will accomplish various tasks not pertaining to upholding the network; i.e fix personal laptops, update iProducts, and etc.

**Story:**
As one of the part-time employees, I work on a limited time schedule(roughly 30 hours a week) and have been faced with end-user frustration.  Due to this limited schedule, My co-workers and I solved this by installing the Spiceworks ticket system.  It helped us organize and prioritize tickets with ease.  Staff members could e-mail or leave a written note on our desk to be put in the system.  *This lucky morning,* I received various notes stating that our network was experiencing issues.  Ugh, although this kind of thing isn't unusual as our providers are known for frequent packet loss.  I quickly skimmed over the written notes and continued my morning routine.  

When it came time to input these notes into the system, I found a gem in the stack.  The note contained the following:

-------------------------

* NICKY NOODLE
* Kiss with tongue &amp; handj**
* Sexuality
* Disco Ball
* Public Sexy Time
* The Queen of England &amp; Usher

-------------------------


Here's picture proof:

I wasn't sure how to go about this... But I did inquire with our providers and got some ""yeah we're on it"" statements.  

I haven't found the person that submitted this note and I hope they get their problems and questions answered.  

EDIT: I made the grave mistake of searching these terms on the web........

hicow,3,1,1r4nrx,40,"Inspired by both /u/smokeybehr and /u/FredFltStn, I have printer problems that still crop up.  

The ERP system at work is a little derpy.  It uses tables based on FoxPro dbf files, but mangled in strange and proprietary ways many, many years ago.  

One day, maybe three years ago, I get a panicked 'Hicow? I think something's wrong with the printer!' I look, and it's got a 2 inch high stack of invoices, but they're the same invoice, repeating the same line over and over.  I remote into the server and it's got 40k+ pages queued up.  I kill it and get with the ERP support people, who inform me of the fun fact of duplicate lines in invoice files and this is the symptom.  We get it cleared up and all is well.  

About a year later, I get a call from the girl in A/R - '[ERP Application] locked up on me, can you fix it?' As I'm heading upstairs, I pass that same printer, and behold, another two-inch pile of invoices, with the repeating a line over and over.  Call A/R girl, tell her it'll be a minute because the duplicate-line problem is happening again, to which she replies ""oh, I just printed something and that's when it froze.""  Remote into server, 217k pages spooled, and they keep spooling as I watch in horrified fascination.  Kill it, fix the file, move on with my day.  

2 months ago, same goddamn thing, only I manage to kill it when there were only 50 pages on the output tray and 20k+ pages spooled up.

There should have been 6 days not 4. IF indeed we get 30 days per password, why was I cheated out of 2 days? I have noticed that whenever updates to the internet/intranet and/or the computers themselves, I can lose as many as four days of the 30. Also even without the update issues, just under normal circumstances, I need to log off several times a day when certain people relieve me so I can take a break so that they can use my computer under their password.

Naznac,13,10,1qzrlj,24,"A bit of backstory on me since I’m a first time poster here. I work as the only primary SCCM admin for a large company (around 8000 people). I have some backups but I end up doing most of the work for quality purposes. We have 2 separate SCCM2012 sites, one for our main office where half our employees are and one for Global. We currently have around 30 distribution points worldwide and are adding one or two almost every month. This just happened this morning on one of those, a new site in India that we are setting up. Indian Tech is a current employee and is the IT contact for one of our others sites in india. SiteTech is a new employee and is going to be the IT onsite. Indian Tech is there to set things up. So on to the story and sorry if my formatting sucks as I’ve pulled this almost directly from lync with some cleanup.


So after multiple issues to send our corporate image over there (sftp was deleting the files, still working with the networks team on that one to figure out why it didn’t wait the regular delay but that’s another story. I also take care of the corporate image BTW currently trying to standardize everything with a global task sequence) I got the prestaged packages loaded on the DP last night and sent an email to the tech to get him to give it a run. I contact him first thing when I get in this morning.


Naznac [7:04 AM]: Hello, did the imaging work?

Indian Tech [7:04 AM]: hi

Naznac [7:07 AM]: did you test the image?

Indian Tech [7:09 AM]: pls check email 
**he sent me an email because he can’t find the OU for the site because site techs do not have global access to AD and have to prestage computer accounts before they put them on the domain… which not needed by SCCM2012**

Naznac [7:09 AM]: You don't need to create the entry,just follow the procedure i sent you. **See below for email**

Process is actually pretty simple:
1.	Boot From network

2.	Enter Password when asked: **redacted**

3.	Select the x64 global image for user computers (for classroom computer I will upload the clean image tomorrow it will be named Windows 7 Pro Clean)**Keep this in mind**

4.	DOUBLE-CLICK ON OSDComputerName (I cannot stress this enough DO NOT click next, you must double click on the aforementioned variable)

5.	Enter the proper pc name (**Redacted**)**Remember this as well**

6.	Ignore application master list errors

7.	Any issues beyond that send me an email

Naznac [7:14 AM]: just follow the procedure **I may sound rude but I’ve dealt with him before and he’s not too inclined to listen…**

Indian Tech [7:14 AM]: but system is not in Domain **still not listening**

Naznac [7:14 AM]:  it's in another OU **he sent me a screenshot of his OU that he can see** it's all set up

Indian Tech [10:19 AM]: oki

Indian Tech [10:27 AM]: yes all well. **Great!** my worry is only, how we can give user to install admin rights to install any software, if required

mdsnbelle,7,4,1r8mwy,38,"Backstory: I support a school system.

Our middle and high schools have a scheduling package that sends the kids where they need to be during the day and tells us who is teaching them for state reporting.  The elementary schools don't.

It went out in August with reminders in September and October.

After several schools failed to comply, we identified our bad eggs, sent them to the head of the IT department, and he distributed them to the  schools that haven't complied.

That's when the excuses started.  Not from the principals, the secretaries who should have been doing this the entire time. They keep claiming they ""did it before,"" but the system deleted their records.  That's what they told their bosses, who are now telling their bosses, who is now telling my boss's boss that that's what happened.  Luckily, my boss and I know that that's 100% not possible. **The system does not magically delete data that wasn't there in the first place!**  I'm just pissed that the custom system I helped design (that I've now given 8 years of my life to) has this reputation of deleting data at will when it's the sheer fucking laziness of my users and their unwillingness to get caught not doing their jobs that is causing the downfall of its reputation.

Email the tech directly who will be doing the install with his account credentials and server address/name. I reply all to the request letting all the interested parties know that I've done this.  Return to drinking my coffee and enjoying my morning...

Until I receive a response from the tech to the email I just sent with all his credentials in it... with one person cc'd on it.  Ok, now this person knows your password.  Well, the person he has cc'd is tech illiterate (read: my OS is Internet Explorer) so I'm not that fussed.  Return to my coffee and indulge in some Reddit....

Until I receive yet another email.  This time it's the project coordinator from the company replying to everyone in the email chain.... with the email I sent to the tech with his account details as an attachment.  Holy hell , Batman!  Perhaps there are a few more people you'd like to share YOUR ACCOUNT NAME AND PASSWORD WITH?!?!? 

I reset Tech's password and inform him of the change.  I also tell him to please not forward it to anyone else.  He apologizes and no more sharing (that I was a part of) occurs.

**Instance the Second**

This actually occurred as I was typing the first part of this up. 

Tech 2 needs a Teamviewer session to a new application server to make sure it is up to snuff before install next week.  

My co-worker logs in to the server and opens the Teamviewer session. Tech 2 begins his assessment and while poking around he realizes he can't log in to the SQL management studio.  This is a problem as he will need access to do the install. Temp sysadmin had setup the server and apparently messed the rights up and none of our DA accounts nor the domain admin account can connect through the SQL management studio.

Temp sysadmin remember SA account password so my co-worker logs in and sorts out rights.  He also sends the SA password to Tech 2 should he need it on install day.  Tech 2 duly replies to my co-worker while cc'ing all the interested parties (6 people) that he would like to do it under windows authentication rather than using the SA account.  Cool, it's not like the SA account needs to be secure or anything....

The fail became to strong for my co-worker and he is currently off getting some air or possibly murdering people.

vxstorm,5,17,1qxgr1,17,"First post here but I felt like sharing how I deal with those difficult clients, you know the knows that break something, ring you a thousand times blaming you and when you fix it, because you fixed it they still think it was your fault? Those clients...

So, I get into work to a lovely and polite help desk ticket (read abusive and idiotic) from one of our more difficult clients, I assign it to me as it should be an easy fix (authentication issue on them retrieving emails from the server if you were interested), I have a quick poke around the server for anything that pops out. Nothing really so I email them asking them to confirm that their passwords and usernames are correct etc etc the usual spiel.

I leave it for a bit and don't get a reply so I assume all is well and close off the ticket and get on with some ""proper"" work aka browsing reddit and writing scripts to make my life easier. Alls quiet on the help desk front so I prepare to get some real work done (why not, its already 2pm). Then I get a phone call... Its the client from this morning! Guess what? Their email isn't working, same error as before and that's when I realised that they weren't able to receive emails and so didn't get my reply from this morning *face desk*, because of my lack of response as you would expect (not really but its them) they are rather mad. I go through the usual troubleshooting steps, nothing seems to work. Wanna know why? The guy I was talking to wasn't even in the office, he was just saying he tried those steps (frigging hate those guys). I ask him to get someone from the office to ring me so we can actually get it fixed. He hangs up and before I've even settled back into my chair, I'm briefing the other developer about the ticket, saying how they might call back so if they pick it up could they deal with it in case I'm on another call? Sure thing said other developer, wrong call my friend.. I then did what any good tech support would do, I went to lunch!

I get back 40 mins or so later and the other developer has sorted it and I didn't have to pull out more of my hair dealing with the client, win win.

elpresidente072,8,3,1r63k7,17,"First a little background about my position:
I work as a consultant assisting (design, development, administration, training, support, my hat rack is HUGE) a company with business analytics software.  I work from home over VPN primarily, except when we are working on large projects.

On to the issue, so today I got back from lunch to find that my VPN performance was slow.  We are talking 1.5s - 2s ping, which is bad news for me working over rdp.  So I do a bit of recon to figure out whats going on. I contact another developer working in the office, he gets 3ms ping.  So now it is either my home network, or the VPN.  I ping a few sites outside of their intranet and get perfectly fine pings.

So I call the help desk with the belief that this will be easy (since I have all the info I can provide already).  I call and explain that I have some latency issues over the VPN, I am getting 1.5 second ping to this server while people on LAN are not.  Then I ask ""are you doing anything with the VPN right now?""  Well apparently they are not having any issues with the VPN because if they did they would have had ""so many calls"" by now, so I go through the restart song and dance and call back.

At this point, I have to explain why a 1.5 second ping + remote desktop is bad and how other users may not be as sensitive to latency as I am.  He remotes onto my machine and is grasping at straws.  He first suggests I switch from wireless to wired.  I respond that I don't see why that's an issue when all internet pages return fine, only your network is affected.  He then checks and sees that I have the wireless connection set up as Public for my home network.  Claims that a coworker said this worked once, so he changes it to Home and has me restart. Still does not work, so I make call number 3.  This call he admits defeat and asks me to write it up and send it with my documentation to their email ticketing system and he will forward to Networking.  I thank him for his assistance and hang up.

As I am typing it up, my ping falls back to &lt;30ms.  Coincidence?  I do not know.

effingWitchDoctor,3,4,1r8pky,21,"Hi again, TFTS. 

I posted yesterday about the single worst day at my previous job wherein a rockstar new hire was given physical and root access to a server and I realized that another story about the Big Boss (BB) might be justified, so here's a short and sour one.

BB made the mistake of sending company financial information to an email scammer. He didn't really understand why this was a problem despite our efforts to explain it but he was fully aware that someone had accessed the bank account and it put him on edge. A few days later he sends an email to the Head Tech (HT) and me that we were meeting immediately to discuss security.

We go to his office and BB tells us he has devised a strategy for securing our systems: we are going to change all of the passwords. All of them except BB's of course, because his memory's not what it used to be. HT and I look at each other, confused; we know that this is only going to cause problems but we don't really want to get BB angry by opposing his idea.

HT: ""Yeah... we can do that, BB, but I'm not sure if it's the best way. EWD and I have done a lot fo improve security so far, but there are other things we could look in to.""

BB had stopped smiling as soon as he saw that HT had an opinion. He stared daggers at HT for a good five seconds before responding.

BB: ""I don't care what you think, HT. Change the damned passwords.""

We left without upsetting him any further and did it. The tech department was fielding lost password tickets for weeks (including from BB).

tl;dr: a party of at least 6 is required to defeat a top-tier illiteratus and we were duoing, so we ran.

TheProfessorX,4,7,1r8czm,17,"Hello TFTS! Long time lurker here and first time poster!

I had this phone call happen to me earlier. I work as a Help Desk/Network Specialist/Hardware/Software/Systems Admin/Network Admin/Jack of all Trades person at a small time local computer service company in my city. It's been going for almost 30 years on pure word of mouth alone and it's actually quite impressive! Most of my calls are helping retired old ladies learn their new Windows 8 computers, replacing the ink cartridges for them (as we do house calls as well), or cleaning out spyware and the like. Pretty routine, but occasionally, I'll actually get to do the stuff I enjoy the most like rebuilding networks, troubleshooting server issues, more tier 2-3 stuff if you get what I mean.

For this story, our callers name will be McFurty.

Prof. X: [COMPUTER COMPANY] this is Prof. X, how can I help you today?

McFurty: Oh! Hey there! Oh my, I'm so glad I got a hold of y'all. My computer, it isn't working! I tried holding down the button at the bottom waiting for all the lights to come off and then on again and I tried unplugging it and plugging it back on but nothing!

Prof X: I'm sorry to hear you're having issues getting you're computer to turn on, Mrs. McFurty. Let's see what we can do to get you back up and running again. I'm just gonna ask some basic questions first to get started.

McFurty: Well okay!

Prof X: Are there any lights currently on the front of the PC or is there any picture going to your monitor? 

McFurty: Prof. X is there any way you can come over today? I mean, my husband has some checks to send out and we really need the computer to work.

Prof X: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but unfortunately I already have appointments scheduled for later this afternoon at the opposite side of town, I can make you an appointment for Monday if you really want me to be there in person to troubleshoot.

McFurty: Wait! It looks like somethings happening!

Prof X: How do you mean? Could you tell me if there's anything on the screen or lights on the PC?

McFurty: YES! THERE IS! OH, PRAISE JESUS! IT LOOKS LIKE IT HEALED ITSELF WHILE I WAS AT BIBLE STUDY!

ViolentLambs,3,5,1r8ll4,18,"In my last story I mentioned a girl that would bring her laptop back several times let's call her Z to keep privacy.

One day I'm chilling in shop messing around with our little Lego NXT robot and Z walks in. I graduated with her and she was a weird and crazy one but she comes in, calls me over, and asks for a repair form. I hand her one, fills it out real quick, and I ask her what problems she's having. 

After a short discussion she tells me that its incredibly slow and she thinks it has a virus. I tell her I get started on it and check back tomorrow. I put it on my bench hook up its charger power dat dell on and waited what felt like ten minutes. I get to the logon and she didn't give me her password. I thought well since she's Gone and I can't leave shop I think its time I pull out the ol paragon rescue kit. This is the best software I have ever used at gaining access to files and computers clients forgot to give me passwords for. I kept in my instructors office because in the wrong hands you could do some real evil with that disc because you boot it like an os install disc. It scans the hard drive and wipes ALL the passwords giving me administrator access to what ever I please. Fast forward about 20min and I'm in, get to her desktop and the horror.. This could turn into tech support gore.. You know those ads that can Change your mouse cursor, basically anything you should never click. She had no anti-virus witch doesn't surprise me. I click internet explorer and it stops responding. Okay I'll try chrome.. It stops responding too.. Okay I'll use task manager, go to their processes and kill the process tree. Task manager froze too.. Alright I'll reboot into safe mode with networking and download the free trial version of AVG. It downloads fast in safe mode installs and then I reboot. Run avg and it said it found over 1000 infected files! I let it do its thing but it took so long that i had to wait till the next day to finish up.

I come into shop. Fast forward last theory and im in lab. I check her laptop and not only did avg remove all the viruses it made it more faster and tolerable to use. I open internet explorer and no waiting its fast and responds like its supposed to. I open task manager and it doesn't freeze or crash. I opened chrome and it ran great i decided to download a random wallpaper to replace the black one the viruses put. Dragged it to the desktop. Changed the wallpaper and dragged it to the recycle bin but I accidentally dragged a photo that wasnt what I used there so i open up recycle bin and..

Dear god its full of anime porn.. Literally at least a hundred pictures.. I decided to get that picture I accidentally dropped in there and nope the hell out. I checked her web history and it was full of porn websites so at least I know where the viruses came from.. 

We joked around a lot when we had a PC that was being repaired, we always said hey __ you been looking at too much porn ehh? I never imagined it could actually happen but the job was done so I asked my instructor to call her shop and pick it up. 

After that several more times she would bring it back with the same problem only different exuses and sometimes she wouldn't even speak and i kept her privacy but it got to the point where avg no longer could do it job and I had to format and reinstall windows. Months later she donated it to the shop but never said why. Now that I think about it it had some kind of smeared residue near the track pad..

FenrisFrost,4,4,1r8m9g,11,"This one is from a co-worker, a quickie: 

A woman calls up and needs some remote troubleshooting done, she says her screen has gone blank. It's determined that the monitor has died after being left on 24-7 for 5 years or so, and a new one gets sent out. 

The woman is concerned about hooking it up herself. My co-worker explains to her what a VGA cable is, and that it's a big blue box and all she has to do is plug the new one into the wall with one cable and attach the new cord with the blue box on the computer. 

He gets a call a few weeks later for the same machine, the lady says she can't figure out how to attach the ""blue thingy"" and could we please send someone to help. he gets on the phone and talks her through it but she keeps telling him odd things like ""it just falls right out even if I turn the screws"" and ""should I push it all the into the computer?"" Nothing but angry ""no video"" beeps. 

As a last resort we're allowed to make onsite visits so finally he is able to go to the office and see for himself what has happened: On the back of the PC, there is a gaping hole where the video port was. The case itself has been torn open. He asks what happened. 

""Oh well I just couldn't get that darn blue wire off no matter what I did! So I pulled and pulled but it still wouldn't come loose! Then I put my foot on it and pulled as hard as I could and it still wouldn't come out! So I had $somebigguywhoworkshere help me pull it. We pulled and pulled and eventually with $somebigguy and $securityguard helping me, it FINALLY came out. But I don't know where to plug in the new one.""

SkraeNocturne,2,0,1r8y9u,5,"So, my client has tasked me with replacing computers in the warehouse and on the production floor.  Last month, their IT/DB person quit to go to another job, and I'm still ecstatic for her (employee satisfaction at this client is almost nonexistent, it was worst for her).  We're coming up on a month and a half, and I'm only just now hearing from my boss that they're going to be hiring somebody because they were convinced that they would never need a database person again.

Back to the story, one of the computers on my replacement list is one they use for &lt;large shipping company well known for their orange and purple logo&gt; shipping, and use &lt;shipping company&gt;'s proprietary software.  All well and fine.  I'm doing my best not to have to call their tech support, even though my limited experience with them has been great.  Low wait times, quick resolution.

Right now, I'm having trouble with the database integration since I don't have any documentation on what databases are what, where do they pull info, etc.  I have been implicitly forbidden by the client from asking &lt;previous DB person&gt; what I need to do for anything around here, nor do I want to remind her of the ""system"" here.  So I ask their EDI guy, and the guy they keep around because the owner is too softhearted to let him go because he's been around here since the dawn of time, even though he doesn't technically have a job to do anymore, and hasn't for some time now (probably since the start of the information age, I would guess).  But since he has had experience with their EDI system from a decade ago, I've been told to talk to him if there's a problem.  Let's call him Dan.

I just got done speaking with him because I was out of options:

ME:  Hey, Dan, do you know what data source the shipping data is pulled from?

DAN:  That would be &lt;Access database&gt;.  *Fuck*

ME:  I'm pretty sure it needs to pull from SQL...

DAN:  No, here, let me bring up &lt;Access database&gt; and show you.

ME:  *Crap...*  Ok, but I really don't think this is what I need to do...

DAN:  No, no, here.  See these tables?  That stores the shipping info, so you need to import these three tables into &lt;shipping company software&gt;.

ME:  *trying to GTFO* Great, I think that might be what I needed.  I've got a few other things I need to take care of before I head out (at that point, in ten minutes).

DAN:  Yeah, just a minute.  So these tables talk to eachother in the &lt;Access database&gt; and have all the shipping info, and...

Techsupportvictim,237,644,1r5j3f,1649,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again.

FredFltStn,299,592,1qz6qm,1344,"About a year ago, the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone 4s as their company phone. Since the Blackberry’s that we had previously carried were an older model with few features, most of the managers were happy with the switch.

Although the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities, some of the people in the office went a little crazy, downloading apps and music onto the phone. The phones would sync calendars, email, and the like over the air, and didn’t need to be connected to a PC. 

Of course, many people used their desktop PC’s to charge their phone during the day, plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk. The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops, and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone. No big deal, you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped up.

One of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation, and asked me to help out. She’s not in I.T., and her computer skills are mediocre at best. I sat down at her desk, and went through the presentation with her, with me driving and her sitting by my side, walking me through what she wanted.

We came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph, so I clicked Insert/Picture from the menu.

Apparently, the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC. More importantly, she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies, which were now gloriously displayed in extra-large icons across her 27” monitor. 

I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at (ok, maybe a few seconds longer than that), and she immediately turned 10 shades of red. I blew it off like it was no big deal, saved the presentation, and told her we could work on it later. I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to ear.

It's a dark morning and I'm trying to keep my eyes open in the dim light of the monitors. Suddenly my slumber is disturbed the dreaded Nokia tune... Titidiii diiii tititidiiii diiii diiiiii! *Sigh* I pick up the phone and answer:

Me: This is TECHCOMPANY HELPDESK Macmula how can I help you.

Customer: Yes, hello the mail is not working.

Customer: What do you mean? Can't you see my phone number?

*Tear of hatred slides at my cheek*

Me: Mam, I'm sorry but I cant really tell that from your phonenumber. I need to know which company you are from to know which server I need to log into.

Customer: *Sigh* it's always like this with you guys... Okay, I'm from SOMECOMPANY.

Me: Okay thank you very much. Let me check if your exchange server is running ok.

*I then proceed to check if services are running, send a couple of test emails (all ok). I also log into the exchange management console and check the mail queue, all ok of course...

Me: Okay i just checked the mail server and everything seems to be ok. Could you please elaborate what exactly you are doing when you send the email?

Customer: Write the message and attach the file and then click send. Im not doing anything wrong! Please check the server again!

Me: Mam... What kind of a file are you trying to send?

Customer: just a small video file!

jaydude025,157,299,1qw7lx,863,"My partners brother is a complete moron.

I fixed a computer that was crashing and rebooting all the time by switching out the power supply with my old one and replaced the ram, while I was at it I also changed the thermal paste on the cpu as the pc had not been used in years and was all dried up. After about 2 hours of switching out parts and reinstalling windows and software I finally get the pc running normally again with no problems.

Now this is where the dipshit and his almighty knowledge of the gods comes in.

He is convinced that because I fixed it, it must still be broken because it was not him who fixed it, he takes my ram out and replaces it with new ram he just bought and the computer starts crashing with blue screens again.... 4 DAYS he is trying to fix that computer because he is convinced that the ram he JUST brought is not the problem despite the fact that is was working perfectly before he fucking changed it.

And so he finally buys new ram, And now cannot seem to install windows from a usb, absolutely refusing my help he spends the next full day staring at a blank screen like he is going to fix it using only the power of his mind!

Now it has been a few months since all this happened and it is working again, but only now has he realized that my power supply in still in there and he has brought a new one, he is also going to remove all my thermal paste and replace that to.

Now here is the good bit, I replaced the wifi card in it with a 300mbps one ""it only had a 150mbps card in it"" and now he thinks the new wifi card is too powerful for the computer and it is going to ""short it out and blow up""

And this is what I have to live with for the next several months.

PS: It is not his computer its the pc in the lounge room, I fixed it so my partner could use it.

Edit: He reinstalled windows because I installed my copy on there, and not his.

acthrellis,179,215,1qrlh3,831,"**WARNING: LONG RANT**

**Background**:  I am not nearly as smart as most of you, I never went to college, just took some begininer (PC Repair &amp; Networking) classes at a tech school, and then studied certifications on my own.  2 weeks ago I was promoted from a temp position to a full-time IT position, in a company with no in-house IT department.  I've never had an official fix-it job, I freelance when unemployed, and have always been the resident my-mouse-is-possessed-help-me go-to, so this is a huge step for me.  Our company has been RAPIDLY growing and expanding over the past year, so much that no one can keep up, and they can't hire people fast enough.  We have almost a dozen separate IT firms contracted, each one for something different.  One for email, one for helpdesk, one for internet, one for voip, one for each piece of proprietary software, etc.  Shit's crazy.  They have discovered about 3 years too late, that this isn't going to work, and we need our own IT.  Enter me.  I am starting out by supporting our brand-new, custom-made software that goes out to our facilities.

I always assumed it was just ignorance, not pure stupidity.  That all people needed was a chance to learn, and they'd eventually be okay on their own.  *Stop laughing at me.*  So here, are couple from these last two weeks that completely blew my mind.

**Lady calls in, can't login to software.  I have her walk me through what she's doing:**

Lady: ""I open the thingy, click my name, and click the login button.  It's giving me some error.""

Me:   ""Did you type in your password?""

Lady: ""What's a password?""


Now the best part of this: The very first time you attempt to login to this software, it forces you to choose a password.  You cannot ever use this software without personally setting up a password.  I look into her user profile, and it's (I swear I'm telling the truth) ""suckdick12345.""  So, 1.) she has obviously logged in before, and 2.) I am not allowed to do password resets (IDKwhy), I have to tell them their password over the phone.  Ugh.


**Another lady calls in.  The billing reports are all screwed up.  I find out that she can see the future, and is effectively discharging patients before they've received any treatment.  I don't know how this works in her head, because the patients don't leave until they're ready to leave, so.. uhhh.  Anyway, I tell her this, and she says:**

Lady: ""But I like my way.""

Me:   ""I understand, but this is how the system works.  Wouldn't it be much easier to do it right the first time, instead of having to go back in multiple times every day to edit the patient?""

Lady: ""No, because I'm right.  Also, I don't like the color of the software, can you make it pink?  I think if it was pink people would be much happier at work.  And add a link to Facebook so I can check my friends when I'm bored.""

Unfortunately, my phone immediately ""dropped"" the call right then.  Weird.


This got way too long, so I'll save the others for another time if anyone's interested.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the resources and observations!  Like I said, I'm new to this level, and I can't tell you how much you're helping me.

""When it rains, it pours,"" I grumbled, sipping at a drip-brewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and taste.

Given the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurig-brewed coffee, I'd prised open ten K-cups of Dark Magic to fill a double-filter of coffee, which I then brewed up. The weather in Austin had started to get cool again, after a weekend that was an all-too-unpleasant reminder of the ball-scorcher that was summer, and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets. On top of everything, my second-newest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty, so it fell to me to get things done in his stead.

""Never send a PFY to do a network admin's job,"" I continued, sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet, as is my wont, and my cell phone burst into Rick Astley's dulcet tones, signifying an incoming call. I arched an eyebrow - I hadn't expected the campus tech to call me, not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on. A quick flick of the screen later, and my One's speakers blasted his voice out into the office.

""Hey, Jack, we've got a problem here,"" he said, frustration evident in his voice.

""Is it NEW_PFY?"" I took a sip. ""Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXAS_COLLEGE in my contact list.""

I could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it. ""No, he didn't do anything. He _knows better_. I've got something new for you.""

He detailed the situation, leaving nothing out - apparently, a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to off-campus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant, and in his brilliance, when he ran into the restaurant, he left his tablet and phone on the front seat, and the car unlocked.

The imbecile also left his keys in the cupholder.

...

You can guess where this is going.

...

Ten minutes later, when he came out with his order, his gadgets were gone, and so was his nice new car.

He got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did, and the administration was in an uproar. I shrugged. A car stolen? Whoopdy-shit, that's why we have insurance, it'd be covered. The tablet? Not so much. A police report had already been filed, and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them, and if it was at all possible, to try to save the car.

_It's the principle of the thing,_ I thought to myself, as I plugged the kid's credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode. A few clicks later, the police report number was registered with Computrace, and the tablet flagged as stolen. _Such useful tools... but only in the right hands._ I smirked. _Of course, it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misused._

About twenty minutes later, the device stopped moving (ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool), and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic, I took a look at the final location. Something seemed... off... about it. I grabbed the nearest cross-streets and plugged it into Google Maps, then switched to Satellite View. 

My eyebrows went up at what I saw, and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys. I drained my coffee, then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door. I had a drive to make.

- - - - -

**A SHORT WHILE LATER...**

- - - - - 

I walked into the school, phone (and bag of fast food - from a _rather popular nearby restaurant_) in hand, and strolled into the campus tech's office.

""What're you doing here?"" he asked. ""Didn't you track the phone and tablet?""

I nodded, and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone, followed by the bag of food. His eyes widened.

""You've got to be joking.""

I shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery, showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before (not entirely coincidentally, taken outside a _rather popular nearby restaurant_), and he started chuckling.

""I pity him."" I could sense the laughter rising in him, and he stood up and locked his machine. ""The kid's in the office,"" he said, and walked out of his office, with me following. I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY, who was sitting in the corner, stripping down machines for parts in his free period.

Sure enough, the kid was in the office, and his father was there too, as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in hand.

""Did you find my phone?"" the kid said, jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech frantically.

""Forget the phone,"" his father said. ""Where's the car?""

""I'm honestly surprised he doesn't know,"" I replied. ""Given what he did, he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet - and yes, his car too - went.""

""What are you talking about?"" the dad said, his expression blanker than a new chalkboard.

""Does this look familiar?"" I said, turning my phone around to face the teenager and the father.

""I went to lunch there today; that's where my car got stolen,"" the kid retorted. ""So what?""

""Does THIS look familiar?"" I repeated, flipping to the next picture in the sequence, the one I'd shown the tech.

                            TOWING ENFORCED

    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATOR'S EXPENSE

His reply, much like his actions which kicked this off, was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense. ""I only parked there for, like, ten minutes!""

""And that's all they needed to take the car,"" I replied, flipping over to the phone's last location in Google Maps, which, when looked at via satellite view, was the towing company's storage lot. ""As of ten minutes ago, your phone was there, and I daresay you'll find the tablet and keys there too.""

His father glared at him.

The cop glared at him.

He glared at me.

I breathed on my fingernails, then buffed them on my button-down. ""So, phone found, tablet found, car found, universe saved, crisis averted. But just in case - next time, park in the appropriate areas.""

Today one of the sales guys comes to me and says that people can't hear him on his company mobile phone. He can ring people and they can hear him fine but when they call him and he's the one answering, the sound is muffled and quiet on both ends. 

So while he's standing in the office I ring his mobile phone and sure to god he picks the phone up, answers it and places it to his ear *the wrong way round*. Microphone was completely covered by his meaty fist and all the things required for a working phone call pointing in the opposite direction of his face.

lawtechie,45,138,1qts9b,676,"My first tech support gig was at an advertising agency. Mad Men it was not. 

For some reason, the office park had unreliable power- we'd have 1-5 minute shutdowns at least weekly. Ironically, we were less than a mile from the headquarters for the regional power company. 

So, to fix our intermittent power problems, we put an UPS in every cubicle. The artists got these serious 50 lb systems since they had 20"" CRTs. 

Regular users had some APC brick about the size of a shoe-box. 

One of my end-users, a female account executive sends in a ticket:

AE: Every time I have a presentation due, my PC shuts down randomly. Can someone please fix my broken PC?

So I look at her machine. Nothing's _obviously_ wrong with the PC or the UPS. I open her presentation on my PC. It's not corrupt or infected. No infections on her PC. 

All the cables under her desk are tight and velcro-tied, so there's no way she's inadvertently yanking power. 

Since we were slow with replacing batteries in the UPS, I suspect a weak battery. I swap out her UPS and close the ticket.

A week later, another ticket from AE.

AE: Please, please fix my PC! I had another presentation due today and it just powered off!



So I run up. Her manager and my manager are trying to figure out how incompetent, lazy and stupid I am. 
I absolutely can't replicate the problem. She's convinced her PC senses that she's got last minute work to do and it hates her. Her PC only shuts down when she's got a presentation on that day. I'm stumped but swap out _everything_- her PC, monitor, keyboard and UPS and make a note of it on the ticket. I'll check back with her daily.

Two days later, she calls me. It's done it again. I tell her not to do anything and I'll be right up.

She's furious. I can't let this one go, so I ask her to go back to what she was doing. 

I finally figure it out and start laughing. 

I ask her if she only wears high heels on presentation days. She does. 

I point out that she uses the UPS as a foot rest. When she's barefoot or wearing flats, the plastic ridges on the side of the on/off rocker switch on the UPS prevent the switch from being hit. 

When she's wearing heels, the heel is narrower than the switch and protectors, allowing her to hit the off switch long enough to power down the system. The spring tension in the switch moves it back into ON position by the time anyone comes back to investigate.

She starts laughing herself. I make a cardboard cover for the switch and she goes back to work.

sharpie32,60,164,1qqw7h,443,"So I was talking about my student loans in /r/explainlikeimfive/ and I briefly brought up my first work experience.  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion (unrelated, but how fukkin' cool would that be.)

I started the job as a ""Security Intern"", which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions, but also meant I got to do audits of the University.  It was unpaid, but it was ""relevant work experience"" that I knew I would desperately need.  This was fine, because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with.  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs.  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games.  Some of them had Autodesk.  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth.  During that time there, I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them.  If one went dark, I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware related.

This was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the ""Security Technician"", essentially my boss and getting paid, was quitting.  He hadn't graduated yet, but had a better job lined up.  Guess who got the bump up?  This guy.  $11/hour to do the same shit I was already doing.  FuckyeahSeaking.  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth.  I could pretty much make up my own hours.  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin' down.  I wasn't building the images or doing the complex stuff, but the IT Arch-wizards were glad I was there.  I allowed them to focus.  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paid.

All great things do eventually go sour though.  (And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet.)  I walked in another day and there was something wrong.  It wasn't the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server...  It was different.  You could smell it in the air.  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin.  (I own that name OldSpice, fuck you.)  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin, who was my boss now, was changing his grades.  Now, you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin?  Well, because that's how you do it when you're a diploma mill!  Who can you pay less than one of the students you're supposed to be educating?  Well anyways, he didn't deny it and he could've got away with it if he hadn't become too greedy.  But alas, guess who got bumped up again?  Not this guy, actually.  No one did.  Which was okay, because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything we'd need for at least a little while.  So life went on with one less friend, because he left mid semester and never actually graduated.

Now's the best time to tell you about the IT Staff.  There was J, who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security.  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than I'll ever know.  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasn't a foreign national.  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells...  (Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system.)  Finally, there was M.  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled.   ""But that's all?"" you ask?  Yes, these 3 guys managed a University of too many.  They did it alone.  They did it entirely without thanks.  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much, but they believed they were making it a better place.  They thought that if they weren't there, then who would protect the neckbeards?  Certainly not their parents...  They paid for them to be here.  To get them out of their basement.  There *was* also the IT Manager, R.  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew.  He had a lot of other roles to fill, but he trusted J, S, M, and I and so we were largely unmanaged.  It was how we survived and it was how the school survived.

One day, sitting with us in our circle of chairs, R just slammed his fist down, stood up and said ""I don't usually do this, but unless any of you object, I'd like to bring Sharpie32 on full time.""  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life.  By the end of the day, there was a contract on my seat.  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit.  I was sad, but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life.  **$32k/year.**  (FYI: happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together.  They are not peanut butter and jelly.  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste, but not jelly...)

Shortly after him, S &amp; J quit as well.  I'm pretty sure R knew they would quit too, but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing.  I don't remember who had a job lined up first, but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together.  This was mostly because of politics, but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation.  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone, with thousands of students and staff depending on them.  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff, things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it.  Sick of not being paid enough (I found out later they made $45k/year each there.  Both had put in 3 years at least, never a raise or vacation.)  Sick of the disrespect;  we'd have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair.  We would have to drop everything, no matter how serious, and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why, fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot.  There were also days, once a month, where we'd be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought.  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned.  (As a footnote:  If they'd known that one day a few years into the future, they'd be lined up (literally) and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered, I'm sure they would've done things different...  But anyways.  I couldn't get fired, because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure, the network, and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty.  So at least we had that going for us, which was nice.

Things really started going down hill close to Christmas time though... that's when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons.  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP.  Windows 7 was coming out and our image, which I didn't know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems, was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it, because of the servers, because of the network.  I made the decision to drop Ghost, mostly because I hated Symantec, but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M$ tokens supported.  Keep in mind, I didn't know dick about doing this.  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in 2 months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows 7 environment.  But also in that time, I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hog.

Why was the Windows 7 shitty?  Well partly because I was still learning, partly because we were using roaming profiles, and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images, discovering if you didn't set the skipRearm flag before you sysprep'd an image 3 times, you irreversibly fucked your image.  Seriously, when Windows 7 first came out, that was pretty much undocumented.  I remember when it started getting cold.  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty.  I remember it reaching 32 in there and I sent M a text, saying ""Hey man.  I'm freezing in here.  I have a jacket but I'm still really cold, my feet are numb.  Can you call maintenance, I can't find their number.""  He sent me back ""lol.""  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline, I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happen.

So can you imagine being 20, being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before 300 computers, starting to image them all and knowing, just fukkin' knowing that if this didn't work, that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but **everyone's** day.  You'll never guess what didn't work.  (Spoiler:  Pretty much everything.)  It took 8 hours to image 40 systems of the thousand we had, because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network, each one was being handled unicast, creating its own link to the server, creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file.  I felt really fuckin' clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit.  But never the less, shit did not work.  Shit did not work for a long time.  At first it was that no one could log in.  I fixed that, it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile they'd pull based on what the system was supposed to be.  Then it was all of the undocumented ""bandaids"" that had been wiped away in XP.  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start &gt; Fucking Computer, because they were Babyboomers and change scared them.  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldn't use Windows 7.  I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition.  Which, believe me, can be a lot if you're not up for figuring it out yourself.  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground, an undocumented network and server infrastructure, and updates that had to be done manually.  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons, because it wasn't worth the drive home.

Shit was still fucked up around Valentines day.  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though.  They fucking should have though.  I would have, if I wasn't me...  They didn't give a shit though.  They could still play video games and that's all they ever needed.  Valentine's day was important to me, because the staff and faculty fuckin' rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick.  (For the record, popcorn comes in 4 sizes: Small, Medium, Large, My Dick.  You get the idea.)  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands.  One pissed off day a few months later, I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig.  She found out and sewed that shit back together.  I wish I'd taken that pig when I left...

Things eventually settled down though.  I persisted, overcame, and continued to do the best I could.  They were worried about the security of the systems, and they fuckin' should've been, so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends.  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him, who I'll call D, M and Sharpie32.  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real strides.

Then one day they hired a new IT Manager.  That was pretty much when things started going down hill.  I could've survived and probably would've stayed there a lot longer if they hadn't brought this guy on.  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on.  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being.  And so he did.  This guy gobbled the President's balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy.  Anything the President wanted, this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience.  None at all.  Guy didn't know dick about management, so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done.  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos.  He ruined that shit for me.  Not that I liked it that much, but I went from ""Meh"" to unconditionally hating that shit.  He'd talk about wanting to ""bang"" her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice, which was his real voice.  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid.  (A kid that looked like a Nair'd chimp by the way.)  Eventually, they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter.  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I won't go into detail about.  Guy didn't know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter.  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable, which was fine, but the guy was making more than twice my wages.

Needless to say, shit got pretty tense in there.  M, D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didn't like it.  Of course, they let go of the guy they could to make a point.  They shit canned M.  I was furious, but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job.  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present.  Universally, up until the new IT Manager, we were all huge gun enthusiasts, M especially.  He found zen in the long distance shot.  He owned a rifle that I've long since forgotten but was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum.  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his going-away present:  The opportunity to shoot a ""grill size"" full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

So of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning.  Got there at 3AM, had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there, it was still pitch black.  Stars look different when there's no light pollution to fuck with your night view.  

**EDIT 1:**  So anyways, we're out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and he's stoked and I'm stoked and I walk it about 150 yards out to the side of a giant hill.  You don't know terror until you're out in the wilderness 150 yards away from the only light, which is a truck's low beams.  There's just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out.  But anyways, I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didn't want to get eaten by a bobcat or something.  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back...  Terrified.  I get back there and M's like...  dude, where'd you put it?  I look back and it's too fuckin' dark to see it.  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and there's a glowstick in there.  I walk out, tie that shit on, and finally get back.  M's already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back.  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this, I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab.  What felt like an hour was probably 30 seconds as M zeroed in, prone, and took his shot.  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death.  At first you could see it spin because of the light, but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off. That's when, for the second time that night, I discovered what terror really is.

It sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to take-off speed, but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably 40 or 50 feet to the right, from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again.  It did this two more times toward us, during which I truly thought it was intentional, but finally died down.  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned, I looked down and M was still prone.  He'd never moved.  He just, in the epitome of alpha male badassery said ""cool.""  We both walked out to get it, partly because you don't leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up, but also because he wanted to show his 8 year old daughter.  He said she loved this kind of stuff.  We shot some targets after that, then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind.  That was the last time I actually saw the guy.",Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown; or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired.,607
shadymanny,45,74,1qtv92,394,"Some years ago, I was assigned to a consulting gig in NJ for a large utility company.  Not really happy about it as I am from NYC, but whatever. I had gone in as a Citrix consultant, setting up a farm to serve up their apps.  While there I was to work with a very large, national IT consulting company.  The IT company was handling everything else, routers, switches, WAN and their Novell network.  

As I was setting up my farm, the network was really slow.  I took it up with the project manager of the IT company.  He was so confused.  I asked to look at his configurations.  Being a master CNE at the time, I pretty much noticed everything they did wrong.  Within a few hours, the network, WAN, Novell servers all flying...The CIO noticed and came down to talk to me.  

CIO asked me (a 24 year old punk at the time), to take over as project manager, ousting the very, very senior project manager of the IT company.  I took this seriously and went about undoing everything they had done incorrectly.  

Before long, the project was going great--everything worked well.  My company was pleased at the additional billable hours, the IT company was happy I bailed them out.  The CIO asked for another project, of which I can't recall, but happily obliged to help.  I also hinted he should replace the other IT company and bring in more people from my company.  So the CIO calls a meeting and starts to cut back on the large IT company's staff.

I go outside to smoke cigarette and bask in the glory of my coup d'état, when I spot something I had never seen before: a chipmunk.  Being from NYC, to me this was a mythical creature seen only in cartoons.  So I start to chase the chipmunk so I can get a better look.  I chase it furiously for a few minutes until it outruns me.  I turn around and notice the CIO had been watching me, his golden child chasing a rodent around the parking lot/garden.  The disappointment in his face spoke volumes.

She was a complete idiot.  The sort that can look at a keypad and be told: ""Press A, then B, then C and this will happen."" and do it fine.  Then, when told, ""Sometimes you may have to press B, then C, then A."" she cannot comprehend.  At all.  

This is my favorite story and the first REAL indication that she wasn't being overwhelmed by the amount of data - but was *not* suited for this career - perhaps any.

We were being trained at the same time.  We were instructed to go to the same application on our own devices.  She promptly states that it's not opening for her. 
SINCE this was our first week and things weren't working correctly, myself and our trainer assume that something is wrong with her device.
We head over to her laptop and she's not even *near* the screen to launch the application.

The following ensues:

Trainer: Click on ""Connect""

Her: ""Okay.""  **starts scrolling down the page with her mouse**

Me: ""No, no, it's right there at the top. Scroll back up.""

Her: ""I know."" **starts scrolling up, doesn't make it to the top**

Her: ""Oh, okay.  I don't see it."" **doesn't scroll anywhere**

Trainer: ""ALL THE WAY AT THE TOP.""

Her: **scrolls back up to where it's visible**

Me: ""Right there.  Click it.""  

Her: ""Okay.""  **pauses**  ""I don't see it.""

I go to build up a new computer for him (with native sata support so it doesn't have a pos molex to sata connector). on a welm, i had popped the hard drive in the computer and attempted to boot it, hoping the usb sata connector was just being a shit. 

The post screen had came and gone, time slowed down, and I stared in the black abyss for what seemed like an hour, but was more like a second. I started to see a red and blue glimmer, ""can it be? is it?"".

The year was 1995. 

Clinton was gearing up for his re-election campaign, the Bojinka Plot was exposed due to a chemical fire, the Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated, and the Tokyo subway was attacked with sarin gas by Aum Shinrikyo.

However, as these are irrelevant to our story, we'll skip that and go straight to Houston, Texas, where an eleven-year-old fifth grader was headed to school with a rather hefty book in his backpack, one that most people his age wouldn't even begin to comprehend, let alone bother to pick up. He looked forward to the day of schoolwork, despite being bullied by his peers for being different and nerdy, and the many Macintosh computers at his school were an escape for him. System 7.5 had been released the semester before, and it had been installed across nearly every machine at the school.

""Number Munchers, Oregon Trail, Carmen Sandiego, OutNumbered, and Treasure MathStorm. Games all morning!"" he thought to himself as he walked in the school's front door and headed to his classroom. He picked up the copy of the Houston Chronicle that had been delivered to the school that day (20 to a classroom - some educational program paid for it), took out the front, local, business, and lifestyle sections, then snuck down the hall to the teacher's lounge.

Technically, he wasn't supposed to be in there. However, when it was the only room to get even halfway decent coffee...

Well, a detention would be worth it.

He retrieved a styrofoam cup of coffee, headed for the door...

He almost made it.

""What did I tell you about coffee?"" The computer teacher chuckled as she came through the door and took the boy's coffee, his disaffected grumbling not stopping her as she ruffled his hair. ""You'll stunt your growth!""

""Aw, come on, please?"" the boy replied, looking up at the woman with innocent doe eyes. ""It just tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papers!""

""I thought I told you last week,"" she replied with a smile. ""Don't be in such a hurry to grow up. You'll get there eventually, and you'll always wish you'd spent more time as a kid.""

""The kids are stupid,"" he grumbled. ""They don't know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail. They don't know how to catch Carmen. They keep asking me how to use the Fodor's guide! They can't even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zapped.""

The teacher knelt. ""Not all kids are like you, you know. Some are lucky, some aren't quite as lucky. Either way, don't complain. Just help them if they get stuck.""

""Fine, Ms. D.,"" he muttered. ""Can I PLEASE have my coffee? I have stocks to check.""

She shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage. ""I don't want to know just why you're doing that.""

He scampered off, coffee and newspaper in hand.

- - - - -

**LATER THAT DAY...**

- - - - -

After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment, the boy was tired of it. He went into his sanctuary, the computer lab, and sat down at one of the Macs, then started a game of Number Munchers.

A pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard, causing him to look up in annoyance. ""Hey! Cut it out!""

The boy's malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard, causing the Troggle to eat his Muncher.

""What'd you do that for?""

""You're stupid,"" the girl sneered at him. ""You're a nerd and we all hate you. Go back to the school you were at before!""

Quiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him, but before he could say something, or do something, the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulder.

""Ahem. You know you're not supposed to say things like that, right?""

""Sorry,"" the girl apologzed, quite insincerely.

""Get to your lunch break. You're not allowed in here right now. If I catch you acting like that again, you don't get to play games in here for a month.""

After the girl walked out, the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed. ""Look, they're going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourself.""

""I know,"" he muttered quietly. ""I just don't know what to do.""

""Just don't hit her. It's not nice, and boys don't hit girls."" The teacher walked off, and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started reading.

**THAT EVENING...**

- - - - -

The boy was in heaven.

His mother worked for the county teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights, and sometimes, if his father was working late, his mother would bring him and his sister along with her, but she left them with the childcare crew... which, a lot of the time, took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in it.

After a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego, the boy returned to reading his massive tome, and an idea struck him, one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentor.

Fortunately, there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening, and the machine he went to was unoccupied.

After a few quick looks around, he slipped a floppy disk into the drive, and opened up a single program on it. He flipped through pages in the book, occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger, clicking and typing the whole way, performing a veritable ritual on the machine, one with an unclear finish.

An hour later, he ejected the disk, shut the machine down, and went back to his book.

When his mother took him and his sister home, he felt a deep satisfaction, knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period.

**THE NEXT DAY...**

- - - - -

""Okay, kids,"" the teacher called out loudly. ""Go to your assigned computers, sit down, turn it on, and get ready. Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm. Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skills.""

The boy went to his machine, complied with the teacher's request, and began playing. A short while later, the bully raised her voice.

""Ms. D! The computer isn't working!""

The teacher got up and went over, double-clicked Macintosh HD... and the Trash Can opened. She closed it, reopened it, and the same thing occurred. She opened the Trash... and Mac HD opened, with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documents.

""Huh. Well, I'll have to fix this. It'll take a while."" She looked around, and there were no machines free. ""Well, there's no computers available, so you're going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math. Sorry.""

The boy smiled to himself at his workstation, and when the class went to its next period (lunch), he went over to the teacher, who'd had no time at all to work on the machine.

""Um, Ms. D? Can I help you fix the computer?""

She shook her head. ""I don't think so. This isn't something someone like you would know how to fix.""

""I think I kind of do know how to fix it, Ms. D. Can I at least try, please?

She shrugged and gestured to the machine. ""Be my guest.""

Twenty minutes passed, and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while. The teacher had stopped what she was working on, and went over to watch the boy at work.

""So... someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon?"" She stroked her chin. ""And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can, then renamed them to each other?""

""I think that's what happened,"" the boy said, a huge grin on his face.

She smirked and tousled his hair. ""And I suppose that that's going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroom?""

""I don't think so, Ms. D,"" the boy replied quietly. ""I only think I'm going to do it if she picks on me again."" He looked up in alarm at his faux pas. ""I mean, um... I just told on myself, didn't I?""

The teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his ear.

""Told on yourself for what?""

The boy looked up... and a smile was on his face.

""Come on. I think I've got a few things to teach you,"" the teacher said, beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer room's storage room. ""I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here, and I think you're the right kid to do it, Jack.""

pyro-genesis,27,52,1qy4nn,315,"I used to be one of two onsite technicians at a combination college/animation studio/office block. This particular tale takes place a week before students are due to start arriving for the year.

The other tech (who we'll call B) and I were busy imaging a classroom full of computers for the incoming animation students. Various other teachers and staff members were working on different parts of the site, directing workmen and making last-minute changes. I was playing MP3s from the student server on the other side of the site where the students kept their files (some of them had good music and I had access to everything...) when the music suddenly stopped. At the exact same moment B said ""That's odd, I lost the connection to the mail server.""


10 seconds later all the PCs in the room started reported that they were unable to reach the image file that was on a different server, but happened to be in the same room as the mail and student server. The phone rang.

""It's *user* from the office. Everyone's internet stopped working.""


B and I exchanged glances. He raced for the door, I sauntered casually because I cared less than he did.


The server room was located in a closet at the back of the student library. When we got to the server room it was quiet. Too quiet. There was no power, and the UPS battery was utterly dead. I stuck my head into the library, where I spotted a guy wearing a fluorescent shirt and a tool belt filled with electrician-looking things.

Me: ""You didn't happen to turn the power off did you?""

Electrician: ""Yea, *college manager* wanted extra power outlets in here, so I had to rewire the breaker box. He told me no one was using the library until next week.""

Me: *facepalm* ""How soon do you think you can get it back on?""

Electrician: ""I've just spent half an hour pulling it to bits, it'll take me at least two hours to get all this back together.""


The UPS had kept everything running just long enough for him to inflict maximum damage on the breaker box. Figures.


Me: ""... ok. HEY B! Go tell *college manager* what he's done. Then take his credit card, we need 300 feet worth of extension cords.""",He told the electrician what now?,367
lawtechie,21,54,1r15nt,286,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",340
Shadowlady,27,56,1r046v,279,"First of, I'm not sure if this is the right sub, as it's not your typical Tale from Tech support, it's more shocking than funny, but I need to share it! Also I wouldn't mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similar

Backstory, I do outsourced tier 2 IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide. 

Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in, but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter. 

Let's call the user Dave.
Dave had been chasing this already, calling repeatedly and stressing our level 1 out. I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately, calm him down by letting him know I'm on it. That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with 10+ updates to find all the relevant bits of information. 


That didn't work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates. So instead I caught Dave's wife, a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop. I sheepishly apologized, explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had. She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it. In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket, so I thanked her for her help, told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didn't work I would call her back. 

The number worked but Dave was not picking up. I left a Voice mail and went to work. Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it. A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully. I tried to call Dave again but still no answer. It was nearing the end of the work day and I didn't want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something, thinking his issue was not resolved yet. 

So I called Dave's wife to tell her that just in case he calls her, let him know he can go home, the issue is resolved. 

Then Dave's wife drops this on me: there has been a **major explosion** at the gas refinery Dave works at, 2 people were killed and another is missing. **She hasn't been able to reach Dave either.** I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what we're speaking about. (They don't speak Dutch, so they can't understand)

Dave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife. I'm completely stunned, I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery. Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and that's why he didn't reply. 

The moment I hang up I get a message from first line: Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me. He just wants to know if his laptop is working.

squigglechicken,72,44,1r2ucm,270,"A few years back I was part of the IT team for the college of pharmacy at my local university. In addition to the standard IT tasks (AD management, printer maintenance, Outlook setup etc), we also had to help setup any computerized devices used in the research labortories. This particular pharmacy school was very good at research and getting grants for said research, so the university built them a shiny new building and filled it with lots of very expensive research devices.

The crown jewel of the research devices was the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machine. In essence, the NMR is a very large tank containing a bundle of powerful magnetic coils. These coils are submerged in liquid helium to keep them cold enough (4.2 Kelvin, -452 Farenheit) to superconduct and generate a very strong, stable magnetic field. A sample of a chemical compound can be placed inside this machine, and researchers will measure how that compound reacts to the magnetic field. This can be used, for example, to see if a professor's chemical formula for a new cancer drug actually produces the desired molecule. It was a pretty awesome machine, and cost a few hundred thousand dollars.

When we moved to the new building the college managed to grab an accomplished professor from another university. He brought a gaggle of PhD students, a lot of grant money, and tons research equipment with him, including a brand new NMR. The IT team offered to help setup all the computer equipment in the new NMR lab but he refused, saying ""No thanks, my grad students have a lot more experience with setting up this equipment than you do."" Fair enough, we'll leave it to them.

Flash forward a couple weeks later. The building is being evacuated due to a fire alarm. Standing outside we can see what appears to be smoke pouring out of a vent from the basement labs. We later learned that it was not a fire but the new NMR (which was being tested that morning) quenching - the magnets had overheated and rapidly boiled off all the liquid helium in the cooling tank in a Old Faithful-like geyser. 

**The cause**: one of those ""experienced"" grad students had connected the NMR's computer to an old, STEEL CASED power strip. As soon as the magnets were powered up, the power strip was ripped from the wall and flew across the room slamming into the side of the NMR tank which caused the entire system to overheat.

**TL;DR** - Sometimes a cheap plastic power strip can save you from $40,000 in repairs.","Magnets, THAT'S how they work.",314

I was assigned to the London office to write Unit Trust software for investment banks but as they weren't ready for me yet I was placed in the IT department where for three weeks I would be imaging PCs and swapping out faulty network cards.

There were 5 of us new recruits in total, each fresh from office supplies carrying boxes full of stationery, including paper clips, pads, pens, scissors, post-its and a stapler.

The head of IT went through our instructions and told us about fire safety and the usual things you are told in an induction. 

During the induction I decided to play with the stapler, including loading it and then testing it...... on my thumb. 

As a staple went it to my thumb I didn't make a noise because I didn't want to disturb the guy who was speaking but he had seen it. He also watched in dumbfounded silence as one of his new recruits spent the next few minutes removing the staple buried deep into his skin.

Blood was spurting from the wound and to disguise the fact that I was in pain and that anything was happening at all out of the ordinary I put the thumb into my mouth to stem the blood flow. 

Now the bemused manager was facing a guy, who had performed an act of self harm, sucking his thumb like a small child who had just been sent to the naughty spot.

And the final nail into the coffin was when I decided the blood had not stopped flowing and so I decided to wrap it in a screen wipe (full of chemicals).

SirEDCaLot,53,42,1r4i39,229,"This takes place several years ago.  I'd just been hired by a small independent IT firm.  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses, and we helped out a few home users as well- it wasn't something we advertised, but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems, and we were happy to oblige.  We weren't cheap, but we took pride in giving everybody (even the dumb ones) service with a smile, and our customers were generally quite happy.

I'm a brand new hire, only been there a day or so.  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers, and a shiny new never-before-used phone extension has been assigned to me.  It's also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory, you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or another.

-----

So my phone rings, the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasn't from a queue (this caller punched my extension directly).  The caller is a middle-aged sounding woman...

**Me:** This is EDC (first name), how can I help you?

**Caller:**  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot (first and last name) at $company?  (she knows my name and extension...)

**Me:**  Yes it is!  What can I do for you today?

**Caller:**  Well I'm having a problem with my Apple Silver computer it's probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card (impossible, my cards didn't exist yet) and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thing?

**Me:**  Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you out.  Do you or your company have an account with us?

**Caller:**  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer he's very smart you see but now he's in the Navy so he isn't around to fix my computer anymore can you help me?

**Me:**  I'd be happy to help, but first we have to set up an account for you.  Can I get your first and last name?

**Caller:**  Thank you!  My name is $first_name and I really don't know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers he's very good with them...

**Me:**  That sounds very exciting.  What is your street address?

**Caller:**  Oh I live just off $main_road near the WalMart it's a nice neighborhood but it's just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway......

**---10-15 minutes of this go by, during which I hear all about this woman's son but (despite many attempts) still haven't gotten past the 'name and address' area of the New Account page---**

**Caller:**  ...blah blah blah...So I really don't know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and he's on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library (remember she has a Mac) and I'm almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire me?

**Me:** (face firmly planted on desk)  ....  uhhh...  that's not really my department....  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computer?

**Caller:**  Well my son used to fix my computer but now he's in the Navy so he can't fix my computer for me (facepalm) but I've been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book (apparently the right book for working on Macs, who knew?) every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you do....

**Me:**  Um, I'm not really the one to talk to for that, if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé?   (meanwhile, furiously typing out an all-caps IM to my boss:  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxx-xxx-xxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THIS)

**Caller:**  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I don't want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computer...

**Me:**  Well you should make sure your potroast doesn't burn then!  Why don't you give us a call back when you have your resumé ready?

**Caller:**  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potr*click*  (she hung up, not me)

FINALLY, 20+ minutes later, am holding a now-disconnected phone, staring at a New Account screen with nothing but a first name...

Epilogue:  Boss wasn't too impressed with my IM (ignoring customers = bad), but seemed to understand my explanation.  We both felt bad for the woman but there's not much we could do to help, we couldn't afford to sit on the phone for hours.

The woman called back two weeks later, seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation, but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy, and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone (her first cell phone ever).  

The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a several-minute-long voicemail.  I forwarded it to the boss, who (after listening for 30 seconds) called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment... heh

We never did figure out how she got my name or extension.

pyro-genesis,23,33,1r1kgu,225,"Back in around 2007/8 I was the sole onsite tech for an animation studio, a college, an office block, a production studio, a TV station and a daycare center. It was a three-person job, there *were* two of us. I stress 'were' because the other guy had a child, called in sick for two weeks (stress leave approved by medical professional) and never came back. At the time I thought he was the world's biggest asshole for dumping this entire site on me. In hindsight... I learned a lot but should have immediately demanded a shit-load of money.

The network architecture was... primitive. Each business was connected via a single CAT5e. There were no managed switches. None of the cables/ports were labeled. The 'server room' was in a closet in the student library (aircon died a while back, the door was propped open by a $10 Walmart fan). The 'server room' was connected by twin fiber pairs to the main hub (a room full of unmanaged switches used as a thoroughfare by the TV studio staff). The fiber was in theory very good, but it had been cut at least once by an excavator and no one knew exactly where it was buried.

One day everything stopped working. *Everything*. The DNS, the DHCP, the internet proxy, the mail server, the file server, *everything*. Renders from the animation studio were failing, hundreds of hours worth self-destructed as the nodes lost contact with their servers. As the only IT guy on site it was obviously my problem/fault. After 5 minutes it all returned to normal... *I hadn't done anything* other than frantically ping things to see what was up and what wasn't. 30 minutes later it happened again. Then 20 minutes. Then 40 minutes. It never broke long enough to troubleshoot, and I had hundreds of job tickets piling up (""The internet is broken"", etc). Everything was secondary to figuring out WTF was happening.

The CEO of the site frantically power-walked (CEOs never run) into my office.

CEO: ""No one can get anything done, this is costing us thousands of dollars an hour!""

Me: *Then why are we using bottom-line equipment for your million dollar ~~phallic-extension~~ company?* ""I'm working on it.""

18 hours of no sleep later and I'd resorted to disconnecting entire sections of the network from the main switch just to see what happened. The problem was tracked to an unapproved no-name switch under the desk of one of the office staff. It had shat itself, generating a broadcast storm when it went over a certain amount of traffic; this kills the network, all of it because the cheap/dumb switches. Once properly disconnected and beaten with a hammer the network returned to normal. I then spent three hours in the wee hours of the morning custom making perfect length color-coded patch cables for the main switching rack.

Upon writing up a full report of the incident and making recommendations (buy some switches that aren't shit), I was given a pat on the back and told there was no budget for managed switches, but keep up the good work.

effingWitchDoctor,43,33,1r6dl6,195,"Hello again, TFTS! 

Today's story takes place about 3 years ago at a small software company (~50 people) you probably haven't heard of. I was the network admin and did some in-house scripting when I had time; we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems. This particular day we had one of those problems.

We had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing. We were about 90% done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written. They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quicker.

Java is not a fast language. It's great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them. The powers that be (bosses) decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C. They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer (VP) who happened to start work on this very day.

VP claimed to have 15 years of experience developing C. He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us. The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prize.

So on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door. 

""EWD, we just got a ticket from VP. Apparently he can't access the development server.""

""Huh. I set him up and tested his account on Friday. Forward it and I'll take a look.""

A few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and I'm a little surprised. It reads something to the amount of:

i dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server. let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do here.

I'm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see what's amiss. After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems, I email him, explain that I'm the admin, and ask if he can give me more information about the problem. I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go. A few minutes later I get the next email:

haha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss (BB) and have HIM fix this shit

Now I'm starting to get a little annoyed. I email him back that I'll be over soon and deliberately waste 15 minutes looking at pictures of cats. Feeling calmer, I set off to figure out what's wrong only to find him about 20 feet away, standing at the door to the server room. 

Our server room, like any server room should be, is locked and air-conditioned. It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users. Only the Head Techie (HT), the bosses, and I have keys to this room; anyone else must access it remotely. Some use terminal editors directly into the server, some push/pull with git, all are welcome to use ftp, but none are allowed in the room.

I walk over to VP to explain this, but as soon as he realizes who I am, he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voice.

""I've been standing outside this door for 15 fucking minutes! I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck in!""

The guy is practically shouting in my face; I'm shocked, but quickly recover: ""VP, we don't go in there except for maintenance. You can access it remotely using vim or git but no one-""

""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT! NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!""

By this point people have come out of their offices to see what's going on. BB appears on scene and tells me to take 5 and let him sort it out. I hear him calming VP as I walk off.

At this point I'm pissed. It takes a lot to piss me off, but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth. After about a minute, My Boss (MB) walks in and closes the door. He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless, so I just throw it out there.

""15 years my ass. How could someone develop for 15 years and not know how to edit code remotely? What are they even doing over at $otherCompany?""

""I... don't know. I also don't know what BB is going to do about it. That fella sure has a temper.""

We talk for a few minutes, and there's a knock at the door. BB, VP, and HT walk in. VP has the most loathesome smirk I've ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier. BB looks as happy and clueless as ever.

BB: ""Ooooookay then! Now that we're all fine and dandy, let's talk. There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but they're really easy fixes and here's what we're going to do. We're going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants. That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server. VP also wants more monitors so we're also gonna put a video card in it too. EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because it's his workstation. And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind us!""

BB is beaming. MB and HT both look numb, and I probably do too. VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand. ""Nothing personal, buddy.""

BB: ""Great! If anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.""

BB and VP head out, leaving HT, MB, and I doing our best someone-shot-my-dog faces. We discuss it, agree it's ridiculous, and they eventually leave to go carry it out. I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new job.

If you didn't back up your files, you're a moron. INTERNET RULE #1: IF A FILE MATTERS TO YOU, HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF IT ON DIFFERENT HARD DRIVES. Whether this is your PhD thesis paper, or your website, make multiple copies of it so in case someone steals your hard drive, or a typhoon swallows your computer whole on your trip to the Phillipines, or if your account expires on a paid data storage service, you have another copy of it somewhere. 


Disclaimer: Personally I think we should keep data longer than that, but that data starts piling up fast, so I guess I can't really argue with that policy. They're not paying anymore, they're not a customer. Not my policy, not my rule, I'm just paid to deliver the bad news.

Something else people fail to understand: just because once upon a time we had a backup, it doesn't mean we will permanently have that data always and forever.

This poor sap submits an email about his account. 

**Him: ""My account was expired but I paid for it. But there's nothing there.""**

Me: ""Your account and all of it's files, databases, emails, backups, etc were deleted after 3 weeks of expiration, on [date]. You'll need to upload all of your files to the server again as we no longer have any data to restore.""

**Him: I didn't know this would happen. Last time my account expired you restored it. What can I do?** *looks like it probably wasn't expired for 3 weeks so when he renewed it, there were still backups*

Me: ""You can start new websites for your domains. We kept your data for 3 weeks after it expired but you failed to renew it quickly enough. All data, including backups, are deleted. On [expiration date], when it expired, we actually threatened to delete all data within 48 hours. However it looks like we did not, we kept it for 3 weeks. But you did not renew quickly enough."" *I also quoted the email which, surprise surprise, tells you that we're gonna delete your files if you don't renew your account*

**Him: I don't use that email account, so I didn't see this message. The files were deleted recently. You have some backup?. Please help me. I need those files. My clients have no backup. I'm desperate. Please help me. I await your response.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore. If you do not use that email address, it is your responsibility to update the email address on file to one you do use to make sure you receive important notices on your account. We kept your data for 3 weeks past it's expiration. All data was permanently deleted on the [deletion date]. We do not have any backups whatsoever that we can restore.""

**Him: ""I understand that. But a few months ago my account expired and you restored it.""** *doesn't change the fact that I've repeated myself 4 times in saying I don't have any files, whatsoever, that I can restore from a backup...*

Me: ""Your data has been permanently deleted, after your account was expired for 3 weeks. There is nothing further we can do.""

**Him: This time it was the same. It had been over three weeks and could be restored.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore.""

*As if telling him 5 times that we do not have any backups to restore, he opened up a live chat with another one of our technicians just to hear it from someone else. I wonder how many times that person had to say it...*",If I earned a dollar every time I told someone we don't have a backup of their files....,215
dazvn,34,25,1r01m2,166,"I do tech support for a fruit phone, I get a never ending series of *special* people all day long...

Today I had someone who blew my mind in terms of not listening and general twattery 

The guy has the obligatory rant at the beginning of the call, can't connect to wi-fi on this new phone, it's so inconvenient, I thought it was supposed to be easy, I paid a fortune for this and it doesn't work, *winge winge winge*

So we establish that the world has pretty much ended because he can't hook up to his wi-fi, and the guy starts talking to me as if I'm personally responsible. He starts demanding I send a replacement RIGHT NOW, I don't know if he expected me to just pull one out of my ass and teleport it over to him?

Anyway I manage to persuade him to troubleshoot, we restart the router and the phone, still nothing, reset the settings on the phone, still the same.

During all the above I continually asked him if he was SURE he had the correct wi-fi password, yes of course I do I CAN read you know?

36 minutes into the call and I tell the guy I'm going to need him to speak to the internet company as there is something wrong with the router, guy goes nuts with me, I ask him one more time to go and check the wi-fi password written on the router and make sure it is what he is putting in (must be like the 7th time I asked)

""Oh I had it written down wrong, thanks bye"" *click*

No sorry I was a massive arsehat, no sorry my bad, just bye?

F4U5T,36,43,1qy0uq,164,"X-post from a comment I made on a gaming subreddit. Was told it fits here.

So a few years back at Gamestop, I sold a brand new xbox 360.(NOT THE USED P.O.S.)  Like next week he comes in and of course I happen to be working. Im thinking red ring at this point as this was just before the redesign....Nope.

The conversation/event goes as follows to the best from my memory. My manager even filled in a few parts that I forgot.

Put this image into your mind before reading the conversation... I am a 140lb skinny white teen trying to calm down a 250lb super pissed off black man. He was chill last week... 

Me: Hey, welcome to gamestop.
(At this point I knew it was gonna be interesting as he didn't respond, stared me down, and proceeded to slam the 360 box on the counter.)

Mr. T: Yo, ya'll sold me a roach-box.
(Im calling him Mr. T just cause his build, haircut, and anger)

Me:Roach-box? Does it turn on? When it turns on is there any kind of red lights displayed on the power button, or does the power supply have a light that changes? (Im about to just take it out of the box and test in myself cause this wasn't going anywhere)

Mr. T: IDK ABOUT THAT SHIT, YALL SOLD ME A MOTHERF*CKIN ROACH BOX (My manager hears this going down and comes over to help, about once a month people go fucking mental in gamestop so its kinda the norm.)

So my manager and I open the box, and it smells pretty rank. (Not to be confused with dank, wasn't that kind of roach-box)

I'm thinking to myself wtf happened in 1-2 weeks to make this thing smell like someone took a dump in the CD tray. The female employee working with us at the time (for only 3 days so far I might add) ran to bathroom to vomit and forgot that only the manager has the keys...yeah it was frantic rush, but I digress.

So I reluctantly remove the xbox from the packaging to test and inspect. 
As I am doing that my manager makes some progress with Mr. T

Mr. T: THERE ARE GOD DAMN COCKROACHES IN THE XBOX

Now I've heard of roaches in electronics, but never seen it in person, let alone 1-2 week old xbox 360. Ok so now the inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued. I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number. Check. Get gloves from the back room. Check. I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fine.

So I plug this smelly P.O.S. into our test unit, turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction. There other people in the store (minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed), so it was like 'Whack a mole' on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it. Honestly we didn't get them all. Now knowing what a roach box is, my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we don't want to. 

Mr. T: See ya'll sold me a roach-box. 

Manager: Do you by chance have a problem with roa...

Mr. T: MOTHERF*CKER, ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE, MY HOUSE IS NEW, THERE AINT NO ROACHES.

I pretty much take the back seat on this one, I really don't have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it.  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed, locked in our back room, and our store was the newest in the area. There were no roaches in the store....well before the xbox was brought back there wasn't at atleast.

So he's getting more and more pissed. It's getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times, and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something. I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situation...like everyone left the store at this point cause Mr. T was gonna explode at any second. I explain the situation to the district manager who says we can't take it back, I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of sales/customers he is causing. He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it. Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard; he district manager started the customer is always right bullshit.

My manager couldn't afford to lose his job/career as he put years into getting a store.  I was about to quit and go to college full-time so I decided to just return the console under my name, still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in. It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy, etc. In the space where you say why; I wrote ""ROACH-BOX 360"" Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went. 

We made it clear to Mr. T that it was 'user error' and we fixed his fucking error. The customer is not always right. Get your house sprayed for bugs or don't live like a hoarder. 

I never got contacted about the ~$300 shrink. There are various reasons why they let it go, but thats a story on its own.

We replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times, it was just clear enough to lip read the customer. Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that. 

TL;DR  Roach-box 360. Enough said.

Tomagathericon,18,29,1quk95,146,"Bear with me please, because this needs some backstory.  
Some time ago, i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women. They had only one tech guy, and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed, so most of the less important stuff just got ignored. Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech, i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long. Word got around i made work easier for people, and soon, i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy.  
  
So, one day, one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long.  
Now, to explain this, all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS (Large Document Managing System), with different lists for each day.
In order to create a transfer history for a customer (these were usually created and billed per month), youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually (as each day was a seperate list).  

Now, youd think they would just copy what they need, paste it in a textfile, then print that file when they have everything. Nope, that would be too easy.  
Instead, what they did was print every single transfer, one by one, each on a new page, then get an empty piece of paper, cut out all the transfers they printed (this is the part where the shears come into play), glue them on the empty page, wait for it to dry, then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer. Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way.  
  
I tried to show them the magics of copy &amp; paste, and while they did notice it going much faster and easier, the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods. I believe they are still doing it this way.  
  
tl;dr: Welcome to the handicraft class. Today were gonna make a nice collage out of your parents bank transfers.",How to merge two documents without the need for shears,175
Gambatte,19,38,1quffh,143,"In the ancient days of yore, when the thunder-lizards roamed o'er the land and the graceful mammoth leapt nimbly from tree-top to tree-top, I was called in to deal with a particularly prickly user.

My apprentice technicians were sweating mightily under the sustained incoming fire from a horrendous she-beast, who claimed that every time she used a certain computer, they would remotely shut it down on her. This was possible on some of the equipment, but only if you have the requisite access (which I surely hadn't given them) and know-how (being a heavily customized Linux system, it was not a simple thing).

A quick check of the access logs showed that was absolutely not the case.

Certain that my techs were blameless, I sallied forth into no man's land to draw the fire and see if I could not vanquish this demon back to her pit.

First thing I notice: she's not even on one of the machines that can be remotely shut down; the machine she is using is on a completely separate network specifically locked down as tight as possible for security, as it handles some classified data. So what she's describing is especially impossible.

&gt; SB: Your techs keep turning off this computer when I'm using it! It's not funny any more!

&gt; ME: I can assure you, that's absolutely NOT what is happening.

&gt; SB: Well, every time I use it, it turns off!

&gt; ME: Show me.

Now, this computer was installed in a 19' rack, with a pull out monitor/keyboard for the local user. Someone had placed a chair in front of it, but there was virtually no leg room at all. This was not an issue for the male users, who would tuck their feet back under the chair as far as possible, or just stand.

She-Beast, on the other hand, had a different approach. She twisted her legs off to the side, and proceeded to cross her legs at the knees. This became important when, after a couple of minutes, she became bored with the work she was doing and started to fidget as she continued typing.

Yes, she started to swing that raised foot back and forth a little; each time swinging closer and closer to the UPS power switch... And sure enough, eventually she hit the switch and turned off the rack.

Triumphantly, she turned to me to show me the fault... Only to find I was walking out of the room so I wouldn't have to laugh in her face.

*****

ADDENDUM: It turned out she would also sometimes hit the fuseholder next to the switch, partially dislodging the fuse. The other users would come across the fuse hanging out and just put it back in, never thinking to report the issue.

midashand,22,26,1qrsy2,131,"Hello again everyone!

In my spare time, I still do some random freelance work for friends of friends and business in the area. This was essentially how I started my IT career, but I've mostly moved on. However, there are still a few people/businesses that I still look out for when they need IT help.

A few weeks back, I get an email from local business owner, Tom. Tom says something along the lines of ""The two front desk computers keep dropping connection to QuickBooks. Can you come take a look?"" After a bit of finagling, I managed to get him to send me a ""screenshot"" of the error so I knew what I was getting into: http://i.imgur.com/djmDRfU.jpg *Ugh, this doesn't look pretty....*

The way the business is set up, Tom has his computer in the back where the sales/accounting stuff happens that uses QuickBooks multi-user mode to allow the two front desk computers to process payments and invoices as well.

It is a this point that I should mention I despise and detest QuickBooks and refuse to work directly with it. If Tom needs help specifically with it, he contacts a colleague with an accounting degree that is also tech savvy. 

Anyways, I head over after work and start digging in to see what I can find. The first suspect is the new All-In-One router that the business recently installed when they switch internet providers. I can't find anything wrong there, all the computers have (slow) internet and everything is fine.

Next suspect is Tom's computer. ""Tom"", I said, ""Has anything odd been going on with your computer lately?"" ""Any trouble with Quickbooks?""

""Nope"", hey says, ""everything's working fine. My QuickBooks never gives me any errors, its just up front. ""

After a quick Look-See myself, yep it all looks good. No abnormal behavior that i can see.

And this is where I started pulling my hair out. I tried everything I could think of. I tested the wiring, as some of it is ancient. I replaced the switch that feeds the back room Ethernet ports. I ran Cat6 all over the floor going from router to computers. I tried swapping routers. I couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with any of it.

Now, please keep in mind: I have a full time job. I am doing this work in the evenings. Tom wants to go home. I want to go home. I usually stay for an hour or so, and then come back a day or two later.

Two weeks later, I had given up. I simply couldn't find anything wrong with any of the computers or the network. I let Tom know I was at a loss and that he was probably going to have to hire some ""big guns"" to figure out what the deal was. 

I was depressed. I'd worked for this shop since before I started college. They had never had a problem I couldn't tackle. I'd burnt hours of my free time over the last two weeks trying to figure it out. With each knew idea, I thought ""Ah! Surely this must be it!"", only to be crushed beneath the weight of failure again.... I was depressed and dejected. 

A few days later (Last Monday) Tom sends me the following picture with a note, ""Hey Midashand, my computer just gave me this message this morning when I tried to turn it on and its making clicking noises"": (Yep, you know where this is going) http://i.imgur.com/HHcmLYb.png

""SWEET MOTHER MARY, TOM!!!! THAT'S THE CAUSE!!!! YOU TOLD ME YOU HADN'T BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS!!!!"" 

Since I was only there for an hour a day, I was limited in my ability to check for hardware problems without bringing the whole sales system down until the next evening when I came back. I couldn't very well leave Tom without a computer while I chased ghosts with diagnostic tools for hours on end. And truthfully, his system was behaving perfectly normal. No weird sounds, no delayed HD access, nothing. Besides, after repeated assurances from Tom that nothing was wrong, checking system hardware wasn't even on my radar. I forgot rule #1.....

""Well"", he said, ""I guess Quickbooks had been locking up every now and then... but it never gave me any errors so I figured it wasn't a big deal."" *facedesk*

A quick use of Amazon Prime landed a new hard drive on my doorstep a day later and I got to spend the ENTIRE evening installing Windows and related software. (Also, side rage note: WHY DELL!? WHY DO YOU REQUIRE A 1.5TB+ HARD DRIVE TO USE THE RECOVERY DISC!!!!) *ahem* I even managed to get most of his data off. Although his 7.5GB .PST file died a horrible death. Not even really sure what was in it.... His email is still on the server, but definitely not 7.5GB worth....

Anyways, Everything is fine now, QuickBooks is purring along... Although I'm sure its just a ruse as it contemplates its next attack.....

I explain to them that the Chromebook doesn't run Windows, won't work with their current printer, it wont play DVDs, the closest they'll come to MS Office is Google Docs and their home working software won't work. I explain that a Chromebook is designed mainly for simple web use and probably not right for their usage, and suggest maybe they take it back and exchange it.


""Can't you make it work? It's nice and shiny and it was cheap."" They plan to keep the Chromebook and ""get our IT guys at work to make it work“... Yeah good luck! They have bought an HP ePrinter though, so at least they can print, and I went back to set that up for them.


Don't get me wrong, I like the machine itself. Might even get one for out and about... But they've bought it without doing the simplest of research and it's not right for them.

Gambatte,28,18,1r0tjr,115,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths (PFYs), in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

ViolentLambs,34,27,1r7gk3,127,"I went to a vocational school for three years (10th-12th grade) and I took electronics and robotics. A part of that shop was when we had free time (witch I had a lot of because I knew a decent bit. I taught myself alot before coming there) we could work on clients computers/electronic stuff.

I'm sitting at my work bench listening to music and finishing up my transistor worksheet when a client walks in. He I can't really describe but I guess to put it simple he was dirty.. Gross.. But he has with him a laptop bag so my first thought was ""cool I get to work on something today!""

He signs the sheet that basically says that if anything happens to (insert property here), we (the school and its students working on said property) are not responsible. I ask my instructor to see if I may take a look. He was more than happy to let me(I always did fantastic work I've saved many computers and iPods). I look at the sheet the client filled out and says he just wants to reinstall windows and clean the computer. ""Cool this won't take long at all."" 

I head back to my bench open the bag.. And a strange scent hits my nose.. Not thinking I pull the laptop out open it and dear god was I surprised. It was the filthiest laptop I have ever seen/touched.. I press the power button and it asks for a password witch the client provided and as I'm typing the keys seem off.. Like they arnt going all the way down. So I took my slotted screwdriver and gently popped off the the enter key and holy crap 2 little ROACHES bolt across the laptop and onto my bench! I freak out because if those things escape and reproduce the shop would be infested.

I find them under my bench keyboard and squish them with satisfaction thinking I saved the day and the laptop needed its charger. I open the big velcro pouch on the laptop bag and I almost noped outta there, huge roaches made home where the charger was put in, so I thought quickly and then it hit me.. THE LOADING DOCK!

RoninSpartan,17,30,1r251v,112,"So have I got a tale for you. One that has just happened fairly recently. A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accused.

***A little background first though:*** I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies. Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a work-study, picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had. The offer to take on this position was made *because of the server crashing (of course, the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures) and them having 4 other IT personnel (2 of whom were under utilized) but one, ridiculously overpowered, network admin.

Throughout this year, after my hire, I was able to: implement a backup scheme with two-tiers, attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website, learn about Server 2012 to prepare the network to shift from a Novell/Groupwise environment to a Windows Networking/Exchange environment, and do most, if not all of the grunt work of a work-study.

***The story:***
Now because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services. However, there was one I had acquired administrative access to, in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys, Short_stuff, leaving for another department within the college (He had been dealing with the network admin for about 9 years and just got totally sick of it). This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms, events and such. This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people. Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups, this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule (sometimes it would get too busy to check, or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didn't want to see it last minute).

So I read the manual, about two months ago (shortly after obtaining admin access) and found out how to create IT work order notifications, tested with one of the other users that book events for the college. Success. Now we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") didn't have to manual check for work orders, we were alerted at least 7 days in advance. It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out, although no one had mentioned it until last week.

I had tried to figure out what could have happened. I know I hadn't deleted anything, and only added in that notification rule for IT. I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldn't find where they might have been, since I didn't see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules. It puzzled me so, I asked Short_stuff what could be going on, he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset. Ha, well I didn't have access so I asked the network admin to look into it. He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped. I started to think what the hell could have happened.

The IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule, or if I might have done something to that system. I told him ""No, I didn't delete anything. I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert."" Come to find out yesterday, the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime. 

The IT director, later that morning, had walked into my office because of a File/Print Server Cluster I was tasked to create. I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else. I was pissed, I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything. I looked at my IT director and was shocked ""So even though I didn't do anything, I get my admin access taken away?"" He just replied with, ""Oh"" and stepped out.

It was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch, thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry. Short_stuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well, he said to check the text he had just sent. I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well. In the huff and puff state the network admin was in, without any notice or proper authorization, took both my access and Short_stuff's administrative access from that system.

We decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didn't lose their administrative access... This was directed toward us, that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone else.
Me and Short_stuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway, when comes along Lady_blonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal. She asked about what had happened and we let her know. Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization, and she uttered ""I think I might have done that."" She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought, by removing those notification rules, she was only removing herself from them. 
I had an intense moment of joy and confidence, for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all. This was the last straw for Short_stuff and he is going to use it, on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years, to take down the network admin. 

Later that evening just before I left to head home, I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster. He then mentioned about us not being at fault, but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help. Lady_blonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake, without us telling her to. We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue. 

I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his (not just this one but many) assumptions and wrongful accusations.

Will keep you all informed of the result. 

--- 

***Update:*** I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such. She has just recently started working here a few months back. Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong, he gave her a call. She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending. He stated about me, ""He doesn't know what he is doing. He went in the system and screwed something up.""

---

***Update 2:*** So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation. I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with. He replied with, ""This has happened in the past to Short_stuff before and I had talked with GOD_OF_IT about it previously. 
It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident."" 

He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system... (I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but ***IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!***)

Short_stuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GOD_OF_IT will be on the President's desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw. Short_stuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend.  

Short_stuff put up with GOD_OF_IT's shit for 9 years... 

I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe, just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience.

We are supposed to have that meeting shortly, this will definitely be a point that is brought up.

Gambatte,19,21,1qy5wl,98,"Earlier this year, a new ticketing system was implemented. Good times. The CEO was enamored of this cloud based system, and would not be dissuaded.

One of the first tickets he raised (in fact, the seventh ticket ever raised on the new system) was a fairly large change in the functionality of one of the data handling applications, which meant that in certain situations, some of the messages that were previously generated would instead be suppressed. The ticket was later enlarged to suppress a second group of messages; all of which was emailed to and approved by the CEO.

A few weeks after the change went live, the CEO suddenly charged up to my desk at great speed, wildly flinging excrement in all directions:

&gt; CEO: Holy crap! I just had [client] on the phone and they didn't get [first group message]! This is a major failure on our part! The company could be liable... We'd have to close the doors, fold the company if they get the lawyers involved.

Zehnpae,17,13,1r05kc,94,"I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician.  Going into businesses and people’s homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is.  You just can’t explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of semi-nude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PC.

As with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder, “Is this job really worth it?”

I’ve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goes.

I spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech. This was back in late 90’s, early-naughties (double-0’s?) when it was still a bit of an oddity.  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger.  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster, cheaper and without them having to leave the house?  It was no contest.

My schedule got busy pretty quick. I would get asked for by name more often than not.  I had adventures, every day was an adventure.  I collected stories like pokemon.  Stories of delight, terror and everything between.  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story.  The one that haunts you in your waking dreams.

I pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon.  I’d worked that trailer park before.  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad.  This particular trailer had the mandatory 2 plastic lawn chairs, area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

I checked my collar, knocked on the door and waited.  After a few moments your standard old lady, let’s call her Betsy, answered the door.  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed, ‘Oh you’re that geek guy! Come on in.’

I took a step inside the door, felt a crunch, took another step, felt another crunch.  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked on.

Kitty litter.

I glanced around and found that it was everywhere.  I couldn’t actually see the floor itself.  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in.  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big ‘nope’ but I was too much the professional.  I asked her where the computer was.

Betsy smiled, either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasn’t some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where she’d chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter.  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter, not settling on top of it.

She led me down a short corridor, *crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch*.  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter, *crunch, crunch, crunch*.  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer, a relic of a long gone era.  She offered no explanation, almost no awareness of it being there.  I didn’t have the wherewithal to ask.  I’ve seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanation.

She gestured at the computer, explained that as of a few days ago it won’t turn on anymore.  I knelt down…yeah…I knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button.  Standard PC repair operations, right?  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter.  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about 3 or 4 inches deep.

The power checked out, I could charge my phone.  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable.  No dice.  No spin, nothing.  I then made my third big mistake of the day.

I opened the case up.

You know how when you pour kitty litter there’s that dust that flies into the air?  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time?  If it had been cocaine I’d be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning.  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life.  At that point there wasn’t much keeping me going either.

I explained, to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice, that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had.  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one.  I thanked her and then left.

It was until I was outside swearing to myself, wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadn’t seen a single cat.

lawtechie,21,22,1r39ta,89,"The NMR story by /u/squigglechicken reminded me of another story of ad agency tech support fun and games...

The ad agency I worked at did a holiday mailing to all their clients. The mailings would include some kind of gift with the agency's name and logo. 

in 2000, they get the idea to do some executive desk toy thing. It consisted of a magnetic base the size of a hockey puck and a handful of  1/4"" chome plated steel shot. You could manipulate the steel shot to make different shapes. The agency ordered about 300 of these, all in their own plain white cardboard box.

One artist had to come up with some ornamentation for these boxes. She calls the help desk and complains that her new monitor is broken. She was already regarded as incompetent and whiny-she'd do all sorts of annoying things like using incomplete pirated bitmap fonts and complain when they didn't print or scale correctly on the agency's PostScript printers.

So I take my time walking up there. When I finally get there, I notice a blue/purple tinge on the sides of her monitor. I really don't feel like moving this 75 pound beast, so I try degaussing it, which it does with a satisfying clunk. 

For some reason, degaussing a CRT is like cracking my knuckles- strangely relaxing. 

The tinge is still there. I can't figure out how a recently calibrated, practically new professional grade CRT has a burn like this. I spy one of the executive desk toys about two feet from the monitor. I can't imagine how that'd do anything being so far away. 

I move it closer to the screen to see if anything happens. As I'm moving it back and forth, one of the other artists asks me what I'm doing. I explain my magnet theory but say that to do such a large burn, you'd have to surround the monitor with these things.

As soon as I say that, I realize that the whiny artist has, for some reason, taken about 50 of these things, still in their boxes and stowed them in the open spaces behind and to the sides of her monitor.

I remove the magnets and try degaussing again. The burn's still there, just fainter. Unfortunately that's not good enough so I have to lug this big heavy fragile thing off her desk and onto a dolly and swap it out with an inferior monitor. I try explaining why you don't store bunches of magnets around computer equipment, but it's like talking to a cat. I tell her that she'll get a new monitor when her boss approves the purchase and start dragging the old one away. 

TL;DR- F'n magnets, how do they work?","Ugh, I don't that that'll degauss out...",111
smeltofelderberries,14,17,1qs7vg,84,"I'm a college student with no formal tech training. However, I enjoy computers and am decent at basic troubleshooting. Yesterday a friend put out a request asking if someone could disassemble a laptop. 

It turned out she had spilled water on her computer. Fortunately everything was backed up, but she had a paper to write that weekend so having her laptop would save her from having to try to get a public terminal at the library.

I carefully removed the screws on the back plate along with the battery. There were some big droplets of water in the battery area which did not seem like good news for the future of the computer. After I finished taking the screws out, we set the computer up in a partially opened position to dry both the keyboard and the bottom.

FenrisFrost,35,13,1r7yh4,88,"So where I work, a major state organization, we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support, and their computer needs are quite marginal. Word, Outlook, occasionally Excel, and printers. There are about 25ish people in this department.  

They print a lot, so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space. They have 5 total, and no person is more than 10-15 feet away from any of them.  

So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers, right?  

Our manager approved and had us order 27 individual 3-tray printers, and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyer's PC.  

This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display, so its' light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong.  

It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed. The Helpdesk, being terri-bad, reported each call in a new and unique way, making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure.  

20+ tickets. ""Red light flashing."" ""Printer will not respond."" ""Printer no longer accessible."" ""Print job lost."" Even stuff like ""Computer cannot access network (?!?!!?).""  

Our entire Helpdesk, all years-long experienced, and not one of them asked any basic question like ""Is the printer on? Does it have paper?"" They just funneled the tickets right through to us, because their boss likes us to look bad.  

Well, it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper. A few were for them being not even turned on. Not a single actual problem, in other words, and these are all people who've passed the bar exam, some with major political affiliations. Many were actually pretty embarrassed.  

We get this storm of tickets now once a month, roughly. The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue, and continues to not even ask these basic questions. So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on, we have to go do it for them.

Cust: Why have I received a bill for £120 on top of my normal bill amount!

MrTig: Okay sir, I can't actually answer that as I'm part of the technical support team..

Cust: Then support me, tell me why I received this bill!

MrTig: Well sir, I don't have access to the billing system but if its for £120 before VAT, that's possibly for a BT Engineering visit that found a fault with your equipment.

Cust: ButButBut!...the filter only cost me £1.40 to replace!

MrTig: Was this after the visit sir or before it?

Cust: After he told me it was the fault, I replaced it and my service came back..

MrTig: Well..best to check with CS, they should be able to see more than me and explain better.

Side Note - If a customer doesn't swap out their equipment and verbally agree on the phone that they understand a visit from BT Openreach's engineer will cost them £120 if it turns out to be their equipment, they are liable for it.

Tale Three


I got this call very late at night, but it was from a nice sounding lady who knew what she needed doing and was very pleasant about it all. Customer was having her service DDOS'd by some very unsavoury types, the sort that dealt in very *very* illegal imagery.

She needed a new IP assigned to her service to replace the previous, this was the fourth time this month. I could see notes that this would be the last time we'd do it before we'd disconnect her service and release her, something I had no say so in.

Why? Because she worked as part of a team who would actively monitor the chat rooms these people talked in and engage in talking to them to offer them help or hand over information to the Police so they could take preventive action before something happened beyond image sharing.

She explained that because she was house-bound after an accident working in the Police, she'd turned to this as something she could do, to try and stop someone from getting hurt.

512TechGuy,34,9,1r518r,73,"I have a small IT business in Austin. One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N900 wireless router. I had been to her house once before and met Bella, her Great Dane, she was friendly and pretty relaxed.

Client tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard. I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in. She assures me that the dog is fine and to go in.

I open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps, I didn't want to invade her territory without announcing myself first. She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does. I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle, it is yapping at me. At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the fact.

I set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat, as the home owner suggested. As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth. This dog is huge and would fuck me up easily.

I do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesn't pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing. She get closer and I try to go around her. She moves to block me, so I back up and she gets closer. We are just standing there her growling as I think I'm about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd. I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but, when I stop petting she starts growling. I'm sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on. She doesn't really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog. I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave. The client just moved into the house so she doesn't know anyone but says she is 30min away and headed my way. She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her. Yeah right. This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with her.

I'm petting Bella, who now has her muzzle in my crotch, as I scratch her ears. If I screw with the pooch my balls are done. Now I'm like fuck it and call 911 and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave. So I'm just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next 20min petting her, every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT man/dog petter.

Finally an officer shows up. I'm just hoping that he doesn't walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him. Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention. Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window. I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bella's attention and finally make it out.

I go and talk to the officer to explain what happened, he was really nice about it all and I'm glad he saved my ass and Bella didn't meet her demise that day. I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs. He says, ""Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog."" I really wasn't thinking about that at all when I said it. I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit. I owe him one for sure.

The home owner shows up and the officer leaves. I'm speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is 11yo and normally they live to maybe 7 or 9 years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down, that this is why she behaved that way. She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave. I really didn't feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for Saturday.

I have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they don't bother me at all but Bella was old, dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy. My new policy is to never enter anyone's home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there. Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jaws.

Never again.

Home owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident. I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside. I didn't want her to know that I blamed her for the incident, she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon. She told me that she is having the dog put down Friday morning and that she wont be around Saturday when I come back to work which made me sad for her and Bella. I'm a dog lover at heart even though I could have died yesterday.

I should have already known this but TIL not to put myself in a position to be eaten by a dog.

Space_Lobster,21,32,1qxvdp,71,"It was an early morning in the winter. It was a beautiful sunny day in the neighborhood- cool, but crisp enough to be enjoyable. This one day I received this deskto- Ok, this person was about 35-40 years old and refused to listen to anything I said-was acting like a two year old on candy and coffee, and I over-charged him for parts that were found just laying around. 

As usual, I take in the desktop and I asked ""What's the problem you're having?"" The customer points to the VGA port and starts to wiggle it. The explained to me they left the computer on during a thunderstorm and their internet on the computer stopped working. I said ""ok"". Then they proceed to tell me when one of their family members went to unplug it, they yanked the monitor chord too hard and it became loose. Now I'm smiling ear to ear. I figured it would've taken one or two parts and I was done with it. (I didn't have a basic video card on hand, so I calculated about a week with shipping the part). 

I take a look at the machine and noticed right away the VGA port is extremely loose, as soon as I open up the case, and remove the motherboard the VGA piece falls right off. (This was an old mobo, no DVI) About a week later I get the part, check out the internet issue, came to the conclusion the Ethernet port really was fried as well. So of course I add a new card for the computer. (By the way, this was just laying around) As I went to turn it on to test it, I get zero response. Do a power supply test, the power supply completely dies. I called the customer to let him know they amount of work I have done, and let him know about the power supply. (The power supply also was something just laying around) 

This is how the conversation went:


Me: Hello, this is Space_Lobster calling, how are you today?

Him: Took you long enough. (Really? It was barely a week)

Me: Well, sir I had to wait on parts that were on order, unfortunately I didn't have the parts just laying around.

Him: What was the solution? (As I already discussed a day prior)

Me: I had to replace the VGA, Ethernet and Power supply. 

Him: What happened to the video thingy?

Me: It came clean off the motherboard, and there was no way for me to really save it. (When I tell you clean, I mean you can't even tell it was meant to be there, it took some force to break as clean as it did.)

Him: What?

Me: (I explained how the VGA is on-board for about 10 minutes)
Him: So it fell off?

Me: *agitated* Yes.

Him: Can't you just...you know, put it back?

Me: *Facepalm and blind-sided* No...no I cannot. The new video card is only $15. (This I legitimately ordered) 

Him: Well, why?

Me: All the tracers are completely missing, I can't do anything other than replace it, even if I were to solder it, it would cost you a lot in labor. I'm saving you a ton of money right now. 

Him: What was the other things again?

Me: The Ethernet port, or as you know it as the Internet port was fried, but I was able to replace that without any issues.

Him: *grumbling* I said my internet wasn't working, why did you REPLACE it? You couldn't just fix it?

Me: trying to keep cool There was a short from the storm on the port, I tried all I can to fix the on-board, there wasn't much I could do for you other than a new part. 

Him: Great, just trying to rip an old man off. What about the other thing you did?

Me: I replaced your supply that died. 

Him: The what?

Me: The part that makes your computer turn on.

Him:**screaming** HOW DO YOU DO THIS TO ME? I'M NOT SOME ALIEN SCUM (INSERT RACISM HERE), I'M A GOOD WHITE CHRISTIAN (INAUDIBLE) 

Me: *hang up*

Him: *calls back*

Me: The next time you scream at me, I'm taking the parts back and giving you the computer just the way you gave it to me. (I quickly amazon a random power supply, print out the page as a receipt) The power supply will cost you $59.00 (It should have only been around $23 lol) 

Him: Fine! hangs up

At this point I don't see or hear from this customer for nearly a month. Finally comes in to pick up the computer. 

Him: How much do I owe you?

Me: ""$110 for labor, $90 for part"" (I was only going to charge him $50 for the fix at first, considering it was ridiculously simple as the parts should have only been around $35-45) 

Him: Staring at me

Me: Staring back 

Him: You really know how to rip people off, Best Buy would fix it for me for free.

Me: I really doubt that. 

Him: You shouldn't have the nerve to charge me that money, considering you've had it for over a month.

Me: I called you once per week to remind you it's here, how is this my fault you didn't show?

Him: You had it over a month!

Me: (To get him out of my hair) Fine, $100 labor. I'm not taking any less. 

The guy pays me, I give him the computer (normally I'll turn it on in front of the customer to show them everything is running like new.) In this case I simply just showed him the new VGA port and the new Ethernet port that he can now use. I'm thinking it's over at this point. His last remark had to be left.

""A real tech can fix things. I'm sure a geek kid would've put the parts back like I asked.""

Me: *facepalm*

Now I deal with a professional environment, even though the attitude is so much better, the stupidity is just the same.

Tl;Dr: Old man learns the tooth fairy isn't real. 


",You can't just put it back?,103
TheLightingGuy,38,18,1qwt10,74,"So to start off, this is more of a rant than anything else but you guys would easily understand my concern. A good friend and colleague of mine have taken ownership of doing church IT work as their sysadmins. Wonderful people to work with with the exception of this one who keeps forgetting her password at least once a week. But she's not my issue. So a bit of a backstory

Before I came onboard to do this, I worked under their old It guy setting up Asterisk as a phone server. The guy was pretty chill, But something seemed weird about how he did things. It never clicked until recently. About 3 months ago, he just stopped returning phone calls, stopped responding to email, and has yet to stop in. 

Then one day something magical happened. The router he had setup (Linksys WRT54G flash with DD-wrt) just crashed and lost all the settings. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that our ISP has us running on a Static IP. So naturally, my IT senses kicked in and I started working away. The day later I sent in a quote for better equipment and it was approved. We ordered a Ubiquiti Edgemax router and 3 Long Range Wireless AP's (FYI if anyone wants a recommendation for that product, Streakwave is amazing!). Once we got those in, We took DHCP off the server and had the router take care of it, Setup VLANS to separate the staff, sanctuary, guest and phone networks, got up on a scary ass lift that you'd think would tip over any second trying to put the AP's up int he Rafters, and removed the old Router and routers that were setup to be AP's. 

Now here's the fun part. We haven't dared ask the Operations Manager (oversees everything from everyone) what the deal is with the Old IT guy. But my colleague and I just had to do some more snooping. 
We've found this all so far:

* Backups have not been done for over a year due to lack of space on the backup drives
* Server only has 5 CALS when there are at least 25 staff members that connect to the domain

And for the big WHAT THE FUCK one that made the operations manager super pissed off

* Trend Micro Worry Free agent has been out of date, with an expired not working license for over a year and a half

So currently, we seem to have taken over the entire church for their needs. We also are getting ~$2500 to fix most of our IT needs during the 2014 year. And lastly, Since I'm also an A/V guy, I get to be in charge of setting up our soon to be new conference room with all the goodies needed for anything they ever need. Don't get me wrong. Working for this church (as volunteer work for free mind you) is probably my favorite thing I've done and they're easily my favorite client since they're so easy to work with. I just wish the old IT guy kept track of things better because I'm sure you're all in agreement with me that some of those things listed are just inexcusable. 

TL;DR: Old IT guy didn't keep track of things and is probably going to be fired.  
EDIT: Formatting got messed up. Wanted to add a TL;DR as well",Yay Church Support -.-,92
pizzadudecook,18,13,1r04ca,72,"So I have never posted here before, so here we go.



I am a network admin/sys admin for a fairly large company. At headquarters we have three buildings. One for accounting and IT, one for administration and one for distribution. A little history, our distribution building has been hard to get dedicated internet access to due to its location. Instead we shoot a wireless signal over to it from the administration building to feed it internal access as well as internet. The setup has been working like a champ for a couple years without issue.



A couple weeks ago, the distribution building called, stating they were having issues accessing anything. So I go through the normal steps and check each piece of equipment in the line. They could all be reached from my desk except the AP in the admin building. After a little troubleshooting, I decide to get up and o look at the AP. Suddenly, they shout its working again and the situation is resolved.



This issue would come and go at random times for about a week. Finally when distribution called again, I dropped the phone and ran to the admin building. Now, everyone around here has the habit of turning off the lights and closing the door when they aren't in the office. So I speed down to the room this AP is located in and without thinking about knocking , I open the door because the lights are off.



As soon as I look up, sitting there is a very nice lady from marketing with her shirt wide open, and a breast pump on her chest. She was unplugging the AP to plug in the breast pump. I quickly slam the door and run back to my office to try and figure out how to diffuse this. To this day I always knock on office doors, open or closed, even if the lights are off.







TL;DR: Always knock before entering",Pumping on the clock,85
helpdesk1478,12,8,1qq8ia,69,"So this doesn't relate to my work in tech support, but it relates to my home DSL connection.  A couple of months ago we had a huge thunderstorm.  The next day, I see that our DSL modem has a red light.  Aw shucks.

So I disconnect it, plug it in at the box.  No joy.  Phone line connected to the box and as far as I can follow it back. I see no problem.  

So I call our derp ISP, A Technical Tempest.  After making me run all over doing the same things I'd just done, they said the line test failed.  Well, yeah.  I told you as much.  The fastest they would send a tech was three days.  No budging.

When the tech finally got there, he followed the line back thru my neighbors yard (which I can't see into because of hedges).  Turns out, the storm had knocked down the line and my derp neighbor CUT IT.  TWICE.  From where it entered his yard to where it exited, gone.

FenrisFrost,7,6,1r5ce7,72,"Hello all! Big fan, first time posting. This page helps me keep my sanity! This story touches upon a lot of the nuances of where I work, I am abbreviating it significantly for length...it's kind of a long one.

I work for a state organization and somehow I ended up in the dead center of this large-scale project involving designing the master image of a fully modern 64-bit Windows 7 box to be distributed to all of the state's elected officals in all cities, where the local officials use them to handle elections and all election-related data. 

I'm in ""Tech Support"" -- a generically-named department that is basically this location's refuse bin. Though I have a tech degree equivalent to admin-level certs and do tons of admin-level duties here, the head of the department this project originated from (we'll call her Bosslady) had zero confidence in my abilities. 

This lady is essentially the worst managerial practices you have ever encountered wrapped up in a shell of complete tech ignorance. My ACTUAL manager, unfortunately, is this person's lapdog -- so essentially instead of backing his known commodity, he threw me under the bus at every turn, and they blamed fault after fault on my ""faulty"" image, which I almost always immediately resolved. Dumb stuff, like ""the Image cannot see the printer, it is no longer printing"" and I'd go over and find it out of paper, for example. 

Whatevs, I knew that was coming -- that is what our department is, here, basically a minimum-staffed insurance company to dump blame on so no one loses their jobs except us worthless contractors. 

This culminated in a big state-wide rollout that was handled by a third-party company. We used a particular model of PC, we'll call it the model 100, but some locations had been sent a very similar model months earlier due to emergencies or dead PCs -- we'll call this one the model 99. There were less than 10 of these model 99s out there, and we had imaged them with Windows XP at the time. The rollout guys were instructed to not replace these ones, and instead re-image them onsite. 

About a month into the rollout, I come into work and find a stack of these 99s on my desk with a sticky note that says ""99s...dont work"". I talk to my manager and he says ""yeah the rollout guys called yesterday while you were out, they said the image won't work on 99s."" They had my cell number but opted not to call me about the problem and instead had them drive the machines over 100 miles to our office instead -- setting the entire day's deployments behind and making a lot of people very angry. 

He comes over and starts laying out unwarranted concern, acting like there are hundreds of these out there and I've screwed the pooch. I tell him it works fine with model 99s. He says it doesn't, basically calls me a liar. I remind him all through the ridiculous testing, one of the computers was a 99. He goes all alpha male on me and starts getting stern, and he tells me, ""Fenrisfrost, you're telling me one thing, the rollout guys are telling me another. Who am I supposed to believe? You haven't even looked at these machines yet.""

This was the perfect moment for me to point to the fully-functional master computer on my desk. I slide the tower out from behind its' monitor and reveal the model number -- it's a 99.

I wiggle the mouse and wake it up from sleep. I've had the machine on my desk for months waiting for this moment. it opens to the signature desktop and icons of the image I crafted. ""Sure looks like it works fine to me,"" I say. 

""What is this?"" my boss asks. I tell him it's the master PC, and that it's a 99. See, I planned ahead and pre-loaded all the drivers for both, knowing we had a few of these out there already. It turned out were so similar there was virtually no difference. You just have to tick off a quick BIOS setting for the 99s to take the image -- a step on my instructions that the rollout team missed. 

He just stares at me and then eventually leaves. 

TLDR; Your first reaction shouldn't be to blame something we tested successfully for months. ",It looks like it works to me.,78
squigglechicken,5,13,1r2dr9,65,"The morning of October 15th I had a weird (and ultimately grim) tech support call. One of our users has a Lexmark multifunction printer that has been giving him sporadic issues. That morning it finally broke completely - a motor in the auto document feeder was locked and would just groan loudly if you attempted to scan anything. So I'm tasked with calling Lexmark support to check if this is a known issue and if there are any user replaceable parts for the fix. 

The call goes as follows:

LexmarkTech: ""Hi this is Lexmark support, what seems to be the problem?""

Me: ""Hi this is squigglechicken, I've got a [Model #] printer that seems to have a bad motor in the auto document feeder. Is that part user replaceable?""

Lexmark Tech: ""Oh I'm sorry, this is the Inkjet support line. I'll transfer you to the Laser division.""

To myself: *That's odd, I'm certain I dialed the proper division on the menu.* 

What follows is a journey into an eerie and magical place. I've been transferred to hold queues before with Lexmark, but this one was different. It was *The Shining's* [Gold Ballroom](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/the-shining-jack-nicholson-and-joe-turkel1.jpg) of hold queues.

Imagine you have a crappy radio. The kind with a bent antenna held together with electrical tape and corroded battery contacts. Tune that radio to a late night NPR jazz show. Now go outside during a thunderstorm and throw that radio down an abandoned mine shaft. Press your ear to the ground and listen to the melodies of a big band waltz echo softly up the walls of the shaft, the pitches warping and straining against the white noise of rain and the static cracks of lightning. That was the hold music for this Lexmark support line.  

The closest approximation I can find is a record by [The Caketaker called ""The Haunted Ballroom.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFcxRSLCHg) For 20+ minutes I listened to this bizarre, unearthly music, alternating between laughing hysterically and sitting at my desk in amazement with my mouth agape.  Then suddenly the line picked up.

Lexmark Tech: ""I'm sorry for your wait. We're unable to reach the Laser Division at the moment.""

Me: ""Oh that's alright."" *(I was thoroughly enjoying your insane hold music.)* ""Is there a direct number I could call them at?""

Lexmark Tech: ""No. Our Laser call center is located in the Philippines, and apparently there was just an earthquake there. All the phone lines seem to be down.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. That's terrible.""

Lexmark Tech: ""Yeah... ummmm... call back tomorrow... I guess?""

Gambatte,11,10,1r406j,62,"The gorillas pounded mightily on the keyboards; ruggedized or not, they'd need replacing soon - just like always. Did I say gorillas? I meant my beloved and trusted users. To-*may*-to, to-*mah*-to.

I had just transferred in to a new department, primarily supervising the team for maintaining the user training systems. No, not electroshock collars and choke chains; these systems were almost a direct duplicate of the live systems that the users would have in the field, so that they could receive training prior to disappearing to whatever far flung corner of the globe they were needed in. Seeing as I'd been maintaining the live systems in the field for the last three years, it was like putting on a comfortable old slipper, except that the parts of the slipper that give you headaches aren't there because someone's cost/benefit ratio calculation had decided they were too expensive to have in the training facility.

Slipper may not actually be the best analogy.

Due to some fluke of scheduling, the old supervisor was not actually leaving for her new position until two weeks after I arrived. What's that I hear you say? An actual hand over period? That can't be deliberate.

So first day in, I'm discussing things with the old supervisor (OS), who has nothing really to discuss about the training system. It's a beast, apart from some minor anomalies it requires almost no maintenance. But if it fails, the users will scream and shout until it's back online.

So the actual job consisted mainly of staring out the window until something breaks, at which time the coiled spring would be unleashed and I would leap into action to rectify the problem immediately, if not sooner. Naturally, this is not what actually happens... The day gets filled with side projects, which would be immediately postponed should an actual fault occur.

So OS is filling me in on all the side projects that are currently running (which were many and varied and some actually interesting enough to require something approximating actual thought) and which of the pimply faced youths is working on which, and roughly how useful their contributions had been.

As it happened, I was already familiar with all of them bar one pimply faced youth (PFY). OS had a few words of caution about PFY; apparently, he was especially insubordinate due to an unwarranted level of arrogance. Looking back of his previous history, he had been internally transferred through a number of different IT and tech support departments, although he would give a somewhat plausible explanation for each transfer. But I could tell that OS was not fond of PFY.

As it turned out, PFY was in the building, working on a system installed underneath the false floor in one of the training rooms. As he was the only one I didn't have any previous face time with, OS and I went down to find him.

PFY had pulled up one of the tiles and was head first under the false floor; from the angle of his legs, it appeared that the majority of his body was underneath an especially ruggedized console: this thing would probably have not broken a sweat even if a tank rolled over it. Think big, heavy, built from what may well have been armored steel plate, like an American tractor or an Eastern European *hausfrau*.^1

And PFY is the false floor, directly underneath it.

And he was completely unaware that we had entered the room.

It was about this time that I came to realize quite how much OS disliked PFY. Realizing that PFY hadn't become aware of our presence, she started to squeak; little mousy noises. Slowly, she crept up to his exposed legs and scratched at them with her nails.

About this time, there was a loud bang from under the floor panels, and PFYs legs started flailing wildly as he reversed out of that space as fast as I ever saw him move.

You see, OS had learned some time earlier that PFY was terrified of rats; so OS had started a rumor that rats had been seen in the building, and were probably nesting under the false floor tiles.

The bang had been when PFY tried to lift a tonne of steel console with his head when he'd suddenly felt something scratching at his leg, and was absolutely convinced it was a rat. How he didn't concuss himself, I don't know.

OS was cackling evilly to herself; PFY was visibly shaken and flat out refused to go back under the floor tiles ever again. At the time, I was horrified by OS's actions.

About a fortnight after she departed, I was ready to do it to PFY myself. But those shenanigans are another entry entirely.

Sure, I say, I've got the manuals. It's not rocket surgery. I'll play around with it here in the shop before the install to familiarize myself with it and we'll be fine. If I get stuck we can always call the vendor's help desk, they've always been responsive.

This is not going to go well. ""Why don't you ask the customer what they prefer?""


""That's a good idea."" He's been a salesman with the company for the past 9 years.


Moron orders an analog recording card from the manufacturer. I gazed alternatively at the packing slip and the contents of the box, back and forth with mouth agape in disbelief.


""Moron! You ordered an analog card and analog licenses. We don't use cards for VoIP."" I figuratively exclaimed.

""That's OK,"" I said, ""No problem. Order the server whenever you want. I don’t need any time at all to familiarize myself with the software. I can do that on the drive in. I have no issues with dropping everything else to rush getting it configured with the OS properly installed and updated, and the new software that we have never seen or worked with before installed and configured.
If you get your timing right, I’ll take it out of the box on the day of the install. I understand that three weeks time is crucial to maximize a warranty."" I was angry. This was my best, most eloquent sarcasm.

Jn108,28,12,1qzlsc,55,"Howdy folks! I've been reading this sub for a while and I finally have a story to share.

A little background on me. I am the manager of a small electronics store, we are a smaller chain that consists of 3 stores. I would not consider myself an expert exactly, but I can solve most basic-advanced problems. I build my own pcs at home and troubleshoot most of my own issues.

This story starts a little way back so stick with me. An older gentleman walked in with his laptop. Now this thing was old, and I mean that. He told us it was around 20 years old, I don't think it was that bad but the base of the laptop was about 1.5'' alone and it was running XP. He was looking to get an updated machine, no problem that's what I'm here for. So we look at the available machines and we find one of our low-mid range machines that would be a perfect fit for him. He requests a data transfer, so I write it up and turn him over to the techs so they can see exactly what he wants to transfer. 

Well his computer contained the following:
1. A folder called ""Things i don't use""
2. 3 pictures in his My Documents
3. 1, I repeat 1 email in his outlook inbox.
4.About 100 contacts in outlook.

So we get the contacts and 3 pictures transferred for him. We also made sure he had the right drivers for his printer installed and that it was working. We call him to inform him his new machine is configured and ready for him. 

Well today he showed up with his wife to pick it up. They came in carrying ANOTHER laptop and printer. He went on back to talk with the techs and his wife asked me if I could figure out for her why her printer wasn't working. Now here are the important details to remember here for this part of the story. The printer was connected to the laptop via USB with cable that were labeled with things like ""printer left"", referring to the left port on the back of the printer. She did not have the power cable with it.

With that in mind, on with the story. So I open up the laptop and get it started. My first thought was to get power to this printer so that I could test it if I did get it working. I asked about the power cord, ""do you happen to have the power cable with you?""

She stared at me blankly for a moment, then dropped this:

""Ummm, I'm not sure. Its wireless?""

""Ok, but I still need power""

""Oh, well i have some other cables I grabbed out in the car, maybe I have it there.""

Awesome, maybe I'll get lucky here. Sure enough, she returns with a bag containing the power cable. Now she has me wondering if she has been thinking it didn't need power, but upon grabbing the power cable I see there is also a label on the end of this cable so at least she HAS used it in the past. So now we have the printer on, and it's hooked up to the laptop but no go.

My next thought was to check the usb plug. So I give it a little tug to make sure it's well connected and I finally found the problem. The usb popped right out...usb plugs are usually connected more tightly than that. I look at the side of the laptop and find that the place it was connected was not at all a USB port, but rather the network plug. To quote the mythbusters ""Well there's your problem!""

Moved it to the USB and BAM! The computer recognized it and test page printed successfully. 

She looked at me like I was a wizard. She asked what she owed and she was shocked when I told her nothing.

But seriously...wireless power? We aren't that advanced yet.","""I don't know, it's wireless!""",67

We have a conference room that has a laptop permanently hooked up to run the projector, video conferencing software, etc. (We had a desktop computer there, but they complained it was too big, whatevs.) The old laptop had died, so I took it out and installed a newer old laptop. Copied over desktop items, bookmarks, etc., made sure all the cables and connectors were working, got a new adapter (Thanks, Apple) for the VGA cable, etc.

smokeybehr,17,5,1r2cf4,55,"Inspired by /u/FredFltStn and his tales of printer woes.

I get a panicked call from one of the branches that a printer has been printing out multiples of the same document over and over until the printer is shut off, and when the printer is turned back on, it keeps printing. I tell them to leave the printer off, and that I'd be right out. 

When I get there, I hear the tales of woe from the staff, and go about checking everything. I check the workstation, the print server, the release station, and ask the staff if the customer had wanted more than one copy. Nothing indicated anything out of the ordinary. 

I turned the printer on, and it proceeded to start spitting out multiple copies of the document that had been printing previously. I mashed the heck out of the Cancel Job button to stop it. I test printed a document from one of the staff computers, and the same thing happened. 

I went back to the printer and began flipping through the menus, and there it was.

""Copies: 65534"" 

Apparently, one of the youthful customers (to put it politely) had been messing around with the printer settings, and had set the printer to this ungodly copy count. I reset the copy count back to 1, and tested again with success. 

It was after this little incident that I began remotely managing the network attached printers, and locked down the control panels on all of the public printers. ",Copies: 65534,60

AfroStorms,16,4,1qypme,55,"Okay, I do administration tech support for a large University. Some of our work involves going to the location and some is remote support. 

One faithful afternoon, while I am sitting at my desk, the phone rings. I see it is one of our older, less tech savvy users. I brace my self and answer. She is describing some issues with Outlook. So I ask if I can do a remote support session with her. Now it is no feat to initialize our remote support client. All you have to do is download and run the executable unique to the tech support's account. To get to this download, there is a shortcut which we place on all of our users desktop, and it is called remote support. No user can delete this without having admin rights, and if they do, it will load back on the next time they login. Now this poor old lady cannot find this link. So I ask if she can type the address in a Web browser. It is a long but easy address, but that is not the problem. She does not understand what I am asking. I explain how to enter a address into a URL bar. It is almost impossible not to be able to. She still cannot do it. She says she can Google things, so I tell her to Google our tech support name and the words remote support, knowing we are the first link in Google. She cannot do this either. At this point I have been on the phone for almost 15 minutes. Being as impatient as I am, I kindly tell her I will just come look at the computer in person.

PotatoRoll,31,9,1r88u6,58,"Brief background:

I work in a school with an ageing teacher population, who once they decide something, that is how it needs to be done (like most end users). We recent got a few Nexus 7's in from some promo that one of them signed up for, and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in, in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we haven't even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters. They have been in MY possession since Monday, and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teaching.

Anyway,

 Earlier today, I had a teacher (lets call her Jen) come down and grab one of the Nexus 7's from me (I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network, and I haven't even looked at them yet [AS I WAS OPENING THE BOX]).

I got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing, so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachers.
I lean over, realize he's printing to the wrong printer, change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed (Printer is back down by office) when Jen says ""WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS!."" Now I work in a decent school, but not one that is extremely well off. So saying we need to order iPads isn't something I am going to take well. 

**Jen:** ""We have to order iPads, this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now too.""

**Me:** ""What is the name of the program?""

**Jen:** ""I don't know but she said it is only on the iPad and I can't do what she is doing without one.""

**Me:** ""Ah, interesting, (the speaker is on her way over to me now) what is the program that you are using that isn't available on Android?""

**Speaker:** ""It's one that I downloaded from XYZ website, I didn't see an option for the Android download, but I have only ever used an iPad.""

**Me:** ""You didn't see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad? that doesn't make any sense, can you show me what the program is?""

*Speaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF reader*

**Me:** ""I have seen this program before, it is a PDF reader, have you tried using Adobe?""

**Jen:** ""Well this one has the functions I need, you can see all of the files I need right here, and pick the one you need, then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes, plus when you close it and open it, it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF. So that's why we need this one.""

**Me (to speaker now):** ""Have you tried Adobe reader? I can't imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader not.""

**Speaker:** ""I paid 2.99 for this app, so I think that is why I get all of these features.""

**Jen:** ""I don't think we will be able to do that on these tablets, why did we order them anyway?""

**Me:** ""They were free with a prom--""

**Jen:** ""Ah that makes sense, we're just being to cheap.""

**Me (angrily):** ""You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have, you can't expect it to work properly if it hasn't even been set up yet. The teachers weren't even supposed to know about these until we got them working.""

**Jen:** ""Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work right.""

**Me(boiling):** ""You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend 700 on something I am not allowed to fix or repair, and we have to send it back every time it breaks.""

**Speaker:** ""You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less, Mine didn't cost 700 and I've had it for 3 years and it hasn't broken once yet.""

**Me(tipping point):** ""That's nice but, she is around kids from 8-3 every day, and kids get into things they shouldn't and play with things they shouldn't and break things they shouldn't. If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of 700 DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that haven't even been tested for the same function, and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app, even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned, I've had nothing but trouble with it, I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT, that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goal.""

*Deer in headlights look*

*hands me the Nexus*

I storm back to my office, sit down, open up the adobe reader app on the tablet. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. All of the same functions of the Foxit reader, for free, on a free tablet.

I walked back down to the meeting room, happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker, and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to her.

Got back up and left.

Briefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that, but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slide.

I was still mad when I typed this, but I feel a lot better now.

OldPolishProverb,3,7,1r8b6k,71,"Background; I work in a college IT department. Our IT work area is one large common room. One of the walls of the room is floor to ceiling glass. You know, a fishbowl. One day it was pointed out to the powers that be that we deal with some highly sensitive personal data and that people walking by might be able to see said data, because of the the aforementioned glass wall. 

So one morning we walk into to find the maintenance department installing six foot high frosted plastic film sheets to the outside of the glass wall. It doesn't go all the up the the 10 foot ceiling, not exactly elegant, but it is functional and solves the problem. 

After a few weeks we notice that one of the sections of film has started to peel away from the window. Maintenance is called and they replace it, figuring a bad roll of film. A couple weeks later the newly replaced film starts peeling off again. Maintenance is called again and it is removed, the window cleaned and film replaced. This doesn't stop the problem. It keeps peeling, falling off the glass, but only in this one section. All of the other films have been good since day one. 

Brute force now comes into play. Large swatches of clear packing tape is used to secure the film to the glass wall. We are all stumped. We adjust the AC vents in the office thinking a draft against the wall might be causing condensation on the glass. But there is no change. 

One night last week I had to stay late to finish a project. I stayed through the change of shifts and greeted the late night tech support guy. I finally finish my project, go use the facilitates to wash up before leaving and then start packing up for home. 

As I walk back to our area I see our IT guy outside the office peeling the film back off the glass. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he didn't like being surprised by people knocking on the office door and wanted to see them walking down the hall to our office door before they knocked on it. He said he always pushed it back into place before he left at the end of his shift. I wasn't going to deal with this after a 14 hour shift. I walked away quietly and talked to his boss the next day.

There's a ""server"" at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners.  This software has a limit of about 60 connections at any given time.  This software (or at least their installation of it) has an issue with disconnecting sessions.  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline, the connection remains open in the server software, even though it has nothing to connect to.  When the scanners come back online, they open a new connection in the server software, even though their old connection is ""open.""  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers aren't running as many scanners as the client does.  A quick note, this was apparently not by design, they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed them.

So we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit, send an email to our help desk to let us know, and restart the machine.  We are getting the emails, but it's apparently not always restarting.

frozenfoxy,1,5,1r1o5q,47,"So, I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe. Being the night owl I am, I was all too happy to accept a position from 12AM to 8AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people. Of course, supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment.  


One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed. It sounded interesting, so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls. Whenever the man turned it on, it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed.  


Our first thought was some sort of virus, and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system. He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before, which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about. When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over 500 days old. Nope, not a language barrier after all.  


About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections, all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the pre-installed anti-spyware program as well. This came up with a lovely 800 or so hits. Pretty high compared to most of his co-workers, but not the highest we had ever encountered.  


With all these cleaned up, we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved. At this point the sun was starting to rise, and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call. Painfully, he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup.  


Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer. The man exclaimed immediately, ""YOU ARE DOING THIS?! WHY?!"" It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer.  


He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm. Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office. A good 50 to 100 popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisor's screen as soon as he got into the system. The first seven windows that had opened were dial-up porn services either in Russian or English. When asked about them, the man stated they were vital to his work, which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute.  


As we were calming down the door to the office opened. It happens to sit very near our supervisor's desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen. The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center. After taking a few steps forward, she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisor's screen. Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation, ""He's Russian."" The manager shook her head and left without a word, a visible blush on her face, causing our laughing to pick up again.  


We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily, but even to the final day we worked there together we'd all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn.",Night of the Phantom Open Programs,52

The tech goes on site to replace a failed drive on the server. After the drive is replaced he calls to let the derp desk know and they see another drive degraded and want it replaced. Since the tech knows how RAID 5 works he tells them that this is a bad idea until the set rebuilds and engages our second level to CYA. Second level starts recording the phone call and sending out emails. After much documentation on this situation (and the derp desk refusing to listen) second level tells the tech to replace the drive. Que HARD ERROR in Windows 2K3 and the help desk's response is ""what happened?"". Both techs response was ""We told you so!"". Needless to say the help desk person (tech is stretching it) was given additional training.

Well my first post worthy of posting on reddit...


A girl brought in her laptop, she said that she was doing some ""research for school"" and then all of a sudden she started getting a lot of popups and now her computer is super slow, etc.

I ran a virus scan, removed some malware, whatever.

The best part of this story...

when I restarted her computer and went to her browser to check if it was running properly... It popped up saying her previous session closed unexpectedly, did she want to restore the previous pages...

Out of habit, I clicked yes.

Well, I know why she had a virus...

the pages it restored were 4 different tabs of google searches of... I shit you not... ""Justin Bieber Naked!"" and  ""Justin Bieber Penis"" and ""Justin bieber hot nude"" and there was one other but it was too much so I just closed them all out...

lnx64,10,9,1qy8db,41,"First of all, I am saddened about the recent tornado devastation that occurred recently.  It however has reminded me of a call I had when working at a cable company, which baffled me, because the customer was so clearly uncaring of the well being of our techs.

About 3 years ago, when those tornadoes went through the midwest, I had a customer, in that area, actually call complaining that her cable TV was out.  She lost internet also, and don't think she had our phone service (she did call from a cell phone, and don't remember details.).

But anyway, this was basically how the call went.

Customer:  Hey, my TV just went out, and so did the internet!  Am I in some kind of an outage again?!
Me:  I apologize for the inconvenience this may be causing you.  Can I have your phone number to look up your account information please?
Customer:  (Gives number).
Me:  From what I see here, you are indeed in an outage, as the tornado going through your area took out many important lines that run the infrastructure of your cable network.  This will affect TV, and internet.
Customer:  Don't use the weather as an excuse!  This is terrible service!  Send a tech out immediately now!
Me:  Ma'am, I can't do that.  For safety reasons, our technicians in your area are home with their family right now.
Customer:  WHAT!?  Fix it now!
------------------
At this point, I am face palming hard.  I'm thinking, how stubborn is this lady?  Apparently a lot!  It's no excuse to be yelling at me, and constantly going back to fix it now.  So I look at the weather map, and her address on it..  Damn, the tornado is nearly right there!
------------------
Me:  Ma'am, could you do me a favor?  Can you please look out your window please?
Customer:  *mumbles something but can't hear*  Ok.
Me:  Do you see the intense weather condition out there?
Customer:  Yes, the sky is very dark, it's raining very hard, and I know, there is a tornado around here.  (Though she didn't mention she saw it.)
Me:  Ok, would you drive in this condition?
Customer:  No!  I won't even go outside of the house!
Me:  Well this is why we aren't sending a technician out right now.  It is too dangerous, and we care about our techs safety.
Customer:  But, I need my TV and internet!
Me:  Sorry lady, there's nothing else I can help you with.  I can't schedule anything, not even for tomorrow, because we don't know what it will be like in the future days.  Please give us a call back when the weather is clearer, but I can guarantee you, the fact you are in a marked outage, your area will be fixed without needing a call back.
Customer:  So you're not going to help me?
Me:  *head meets desk*  I can't ma'am.

Customer hangs up.

FenrisFrost,13,1,1r678j,43,"My job is spent literally almost entirely remoting into stations and servers, it can be done from any machine with a decent VPN connection and Remote Desktop. This is all well and good until one day our managers sent us a sudden email, basically forbidding all of IT from working remotely. 


This was significant. An admin actually immediately resigned over it. My immediate supervisor, Lapdog to a more domineering one, did nothing to defend us -- as if to reinforce his impotency, the email came from her, with ""and Lapdog"" bolted on to her signature. 


This all happened because one day there was a particularly horrid snowstorm, and a majority of the tech staff opted out of our gross commute (Gov building in the dead center of a major American city), and some bigwig walked through our IT area and ""didn't see enough going on.""). 


So we were told that we must put in a written request two weeks in advance for any remote access. The email flatly said that you will be denied most of the time, and not to expect much. 


Then, this gem: for my department, specifically, the only IT people with laptops, we are forbidden from working from home at all. ""The Help Desk and Tech Support groups are not eligible for any work from home option due to onsite requirement to perform their functions"" are the exact words used. Ironic, considering A.) they gave us laptops, and B.) we almost exclusively work by remoting from our office to other machines. 


People outside IT use VPN constantly, to the point where we have some users come in so infrequently that we have a VM farm set up for them instead of physical machines, and set their passwords to not expire because they don't come in for 6 months at a time. But the actual IT staff are not allowed at all. 


I discussed this with my boss during our weekly meeting; despite him being a total jerk and always laying down for the crazy lady, we have a pretty good rapport, so our talk is usually casual. ""That was a really bad idea,"" I say. 


""I don't think so,"" he says confidently. ""Most people, when they work from home, they aren't even working half the time.""


I nod. ""Yeah, but now, you've made it so that, on days when we can't make it here, they won't be working *at all*.""

Amaltron,14,1,1r5o8x,45,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, long time reader.

Last Tuesday I encountered an event worthy enough for this subreddit.

An older gentlemen came to the help desk and said that he got a message on his computer saying that he should scan his computer. He put his computer down and asked me to check it. I checked all the programs he had on his computer and he had over 30 toolbars installed on his computer. It took me a solid 20 minutes to remove all the gunk on his computer. This included those fake anti-viruses or programs that were easily removed. 

So, naturally, my next move would be to install Malwarebytes and scan his computer for anything else that might have been left over. I checked to make sure that he had an anti-virus and surprisingly found that he had one anti-virus (Microsoft Security Essentials). 

So, my first response is to open up Firefox. After opening it and taking a bit, he says to me that he stopped using Firefox after so many pop ups started showing up. I noticed he had Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Torch on the taskbar pinned. It stroke me as weird so I asked him why he had these other browsers if Firefox had a lot of pop ups. He proceeded to tell me that he originally used IE but had too many toolbars (he called them ""games"") and pop ups showing up all the time. So he downloaded Firefox and used that instead since it was ""clean"". He then started getting a lot of pop ups and toolbars on that too so he downloaded Chrome. He eventually had a lot of extensions, pop ups, etc. with Chrome so he downloaded Torch recently. 

I lightly facepalmed since he was a nice gentlemen who was understood that he is technologically challenged so I didn't think too badly of it. 

After downloading Malwarebytes, I scanned his computer and after 20 minutes of scanning, I found exactly 1842 objects flagged by the program. All I could think of is ""Holy Crap"". I've never seen so many objects flagged by it.

After removing it, the gentlemen thanked me for the trouble and went on his way. Probably the most interesting thing that has happened at the help desk since I started working there.

tl;dr He made a sandwich. The bologna went bad so he put salami on top of it thinking it will make it good again.","Too many popups, so I'll just download another browser!",46

Richardrsb,13,8,1qvxwi,37,"I own a company in repairs of mobile electronics, PDA's Smartphones, and tablets.
Back in the days, Palm was the brand to go, and we repaired dozens of those smart
tiny boxes every day. I am talking 2003-2004. This is the Pre-Flash memory age, when the
power (battery) is removed, the  PDA obviously looses it RAM-contents.

While repairing a Palm m500 series, this happened. And the memory of this device contained 2 years
of vehicle administration. (Here in NL we need to keep record of our business-car usage, to avoid high taxes, so
this data is VERY important, because not being able to provide it, can be VERY costly TAX-wise).

Now, as a company we cannot be held responsible for users data, but it should be no problem, because
Palm, and all others provide its customers with powerful tool to back-up the devices data, in this case Palm desktop,
so a short so called ""hotsink"" will restore all data, including the sensitive and costly vehicle mileage data....
In addition, this particular model could also create backups to SD cards.....

 After the repair was complete, i returned the PDA to my customer. Het was shocked to see it was reset, and
no data was present at all. He shouted: ""All my vehicle data is lost, how are you gonna restore it?"" I replied: ""well,
your hotsync backup should do the trick. Simply put it in the cradle, and press a button. All you data will be restored in minutes!""

Turn out he never synced his device. Really never. He filed a complaint with his boss Vincent,  who paid for the repairs.
His boss was furious. Not to us, but to the employee.  Vincent mailed me a day later to tell me about the complaint, it turned out
that the owner of the PDA, was employed as an IT professional, and in particular was responsible for the company file server and the backups.

Unbelievable. The loss of his data costed him about € 4800.-

I am Level .5 support, working for a company that is outsourced from major ISPs. I help customers (CX's, as we refer to them) get devices connected to their network, diagnose DNS issues, replace faulty modems/gateways, and SOME limited browser config as well as test for ISP-given email account issues.

Near the end of my shift, I get one last call from a younger woman who needs help getting several devices connected.

The first is a PS3. Its already connected to the network, has internet access, but it can not access the PSN. Being the nice gal I am, I decide I'd grab the ports for her. (Out of scope, but as this would be *much* faster than educating the CX about ports and where to get what she needs, I grab em from Sony's website.) I ask her to grab the IP address of the PS3 from the network config, and she's able to do it without any hitch. *SURPRISE*

No luck getting connected to the PSN. I decide to make sure its not the leased gateway causing any issues, so I DMZ the Playstation and have the CX restart it. When it boots, I ask to check the IP address again (DHCP and all). Same one, DMZ still valid. STILL unable to connect to PSN. Tell CX she's out of luck on that one. Tell her to try again when Sony's network isn't so congested. (Forums revealed problems)

0/0

The other device the CX wants to connect is a Bluray player. She goes and turns it on, and is able to find the network setup no problem. 


CX: Its telling me ""Unable to create a network connection. You need a wireless adapter in order to connect to a wireless network.""

Me: Then you'll need to purchase the adapter to connect on your wifi, or connect the player with an ethernet cord.

CX: I'll try it a bit later and see what I can do....

kaltag,13,13,1qwnfc,40,"Good Monday morning! I just finished up a 72hour PITA P2V migration of an old 2008 SBS server. I had tried the process the last 2 weekends but got random errors running the disk2vhd process on the data volumes. The conversion involved several TB of data so it had to be done over the weekend to be ready by Monday morning. I started the OS volume @ 5PM sharp Friday and let it go through it's disk2vhd process with no issue and it finishes about 10:00 AM Saturday morning. The other 2 data volumes I started and left to run. They are about a TB each of actual data. Sunday morning I check it and both disk2vhd processes failed with an ""invalid signature"" error again. Damn. At this point I'm sick of screwing with disk2vhd and this NEEDS to be done by Monday morning. Out of desperation I created 2 VHDs on the host server that matched the size of the volumes on the source server, mounted the VHDs and formatted them, then ran a robocopy from the source server to the administrative share of the VHDs. The robocopies finished without issue this morning about 5 AM. I then unmounted the VHDs, shut down the source server, attached the VHDs to the VM and started it up. After installing the integration services the drives were recognized and the shares came back. Phew. I got the network reconfigured and some misc issues resolved by about 8:15 this morning.

After much work, and no success, he decides to fly from Massachusetts to Denver to work with the machine in person. (I don't remember why it came to that point.)

Kataclysm,25,4,1r2eke,39,"I work in IT. I've been involved professionally for going on seven years now, and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on 20. I can't tell you how many times I've explained to people the importance of having a secure password, changing it regularly, updating ALL account passwords when you're compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed, and stressing the importance of not using a universal password.

I dun' f***ed up.

Flash back to about 5 months ago. My personal Walmart.com account was accessed without my knowledge, and around $500 worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were. (At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics.) The timing was pretty awful for this, because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills (with accompanying late fees), as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund. After the two weeks of hell, ordering new debit cards (because at the time I wasn't sure exactly HOW I was compromised, I decided it better to be safe than sorry), and generally being completely broke with 3 kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasn't a heck of a lot of fun, I ended up getting the charges reversed. This mistake cost me around $60. 

I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time.

1. I used a unified password system. 1 password to rule them all.

2. My old password was a mere six characters long, alpha only. They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random, but still not complex enough.

3. I trusted Walmart.com to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease, so I didn't have to spend that 20 seconds remembering my information and typing it in.

Looking back, I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer, because I never shop on Walmart.com. But hey, lesson learned, passwords changed, computers nuked and reloaded from orbit, (It's the only way to be sure) problem resolved. During this time of extreme paranoia, while I suspected everything and anything, I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different, much more complex passwords. (10 digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum.) I was feeling pretty secure, I felt nobody was going to get the best of me again.

Except I forgot one account. A rather important one too.

My Paypal.

Fast Forward to this last Monday morning. Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby, I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls, complaints, and general incompetence. I check my personal e-mail on my personal laptop, and see a few e-mails from Paypal.

""Kenneth Harrison accepted your payment."" Timestamp at 2:00 AM. 

I'm pretty sure I was asleep during this time. Or at least trying to sleep. Son of a ****. Followed by another e-mail from Paypal.

""Important: We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal account.""

Well, good for you, nice to see you didn't put a stop to it. Thanks loads, all you did was limit my account, didn't ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through. That's just brilliant.

So, I look at the first e-mail and turns out this individual so kindly transferred $370 to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors, because they did a great job of screwing me over.

I dutifully log into Paypal, and immediately update my password from my old, insecure one, which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account. Shame on me. I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings, and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction. (Still waiting, hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kind.)

So now, again, all my funds are tied up for at least another 5 days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy, just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays. This is completely my own fault, preventable, and I hope this is received as I meant it, a cautionary tale for other IT workers.
