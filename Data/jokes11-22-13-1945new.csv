""I would like to take out a loan for $100,000"" the frog declares. 

Mr. Paddywack looks at the frog and says ""Since you don't have any credit with this bank you'll need a cosigner.""

""No Problem"" says the frog ""My father is Mick Jagger and he'll cosign the loan for me.""

""Well you'll also need some collateral"" Mr. Paddywack countered.

""Will this work?"" Asks the frog and pulls from his pocket a mishappen Buddha figurine made out of bronze.

""Well maybe. Lets' go ask the bank manager."" Says Paddywack and the two go back to the bank manager where Paddywack explains the situation.

""And so what should I do? I don't even know what this thing is!"" Paddywack tells the bank manager while showing him the Buddha.

Bob watches for a while and sees that Satan seems to be sending some people off to the right through a big door, and other people would be tossed into a big pit of huge flames to the left.  But once in a while, Satan would appear to deliberate over a person and then just chuck them into a pile off to the side.  

When he finally made it to the front of the line, Bob couldn't help himself; he just had to know: he asked Satan, ""Why didn't you throw those people in the pile into the pit of fire?""

The client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. She knows that she can't say yes, but she has to let him down easy so that he doesn't take his business elsewhere.

She tries to think of a way to dissuade the king from wanting to marry her. After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara.""

The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, ""No problem! I have. I have.""

Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, ""I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.""

The king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cell phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build. I build.""

Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.""

But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed.

The electricity finally flickered back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate. ""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

So the next day the first person came to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate promptly asked the man to tell him about the day he died.

""Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !

The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

The angel sat back and thought for a moment.

Technically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, ""OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,"" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.""

""Sure thing,"" the next man replied. ""But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! ""

The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""Very well, "" he announces. ""Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, "" and lets the man enter.

MoralLesson,6,77,1qvop2,164,"There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the first time. It was wonderful, the experience of his life. He was being waited on hand and foot. But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.

The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.

One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. 

She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She said, ""I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank."" 

""Amazing"", he said, ""I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?"" 

""It is only me"", she said, ""and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.""

""Well then"", said the man, ""how did you get the row-boat?"" 

""I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island"", replied the woman. ""The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree""

""But, but,"" asked the man, ""what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?""

""Oh, no problem"", replied the woman, ""on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,"" she continued. ""Where do you live?"" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. 

""Well, let's row over to my place"", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

""It's not much"", she said, ""but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?"" 

""No"", said the man, ""one more coconut juice and I will puke.""

""It won't be coconut juice"", the woman replied, ""I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, ""Tell me, have you always had a beard?"" 

""No"", the man replied, ""I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.""

""Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.

""You look great"", said the woman, ""I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable."" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.

""Tell me"", she asked, ""we have both been out here for a very long time with no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely, is there anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need? Something that it would be really nice to have right now?""

If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in New Mexico. 


For those of you who have lived in New Mexico, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe Plaza. Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.


Frank: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in... I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.""


Here are the scorecard notes from the event:



CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These New Mexicans are crazy.



CHILE # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang..

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.



CHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chile. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting ****-faced from all of the beer.



CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chile with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chile.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?



CHILE # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.



CHILE # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.



CHILE # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.



CHILE # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILE

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice
blend chile. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat available was under that dog. ""Please, Ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired."" She snorted, ""Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!"" This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window and sat down.
The woman shrieked, ""Someone must defend my honor! Put this American in his place!"" An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up.

“YOU STUPID REDNECK!” shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls.

“Now how am I gonna get outa this?” though the redneck to himself. Then he had an idea…

After looking over the impressive, impeccably dressed and dignified city lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie, starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back.

He handed it to the hotshot and said, “Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this. It’ll steady your nerves….IT’S HOMEMADE…”

The lawyer did, but was so angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, “You still look a little bit pale. How about another?” And the smug, pompous lawyer took another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun through his wool suit.

Then the redneck said “It’s mighty hot today. Folks ’round here don’t usually wear shoes on a day like those. Why don’t you take off them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?”

The lawyer frowned: “Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who would walk around barefoot? That’s fine for hicks, but not for a professional like ME! These are $500 shoes!”

But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and then again, and finally the lawyer, feeling the white lightnin’, let out a laugh and took off his polished shoes and socks.
The redneck picked up the polished shoes and smiled. “Might fancy shoes you got here, boy!” Then the redneck said: “Why don’t you take off that fancy necktie?”

The lawyer said: “My tie!”, but in a minute, the silk tie was dropped on top of the shoes and the socks.

The redneck grinned and held up an extra pair of overalls he found in his pickup. “And that fancy business suit? You look kind of funny standing there barefoot in a suit on a 100 degree day! You can wear these while we figger out what to do about this situation! Just strip that suit off…”

The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but…

Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the starched white shirt and the cufflinks. Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls.

“Now ain’t that more comfortable?!” said the redneck.

At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another, and another.

The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn’t think that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn’t find the redneck…

“Not me”, the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree. The lawyer stared at him in shock, but was now so drunk he couldn’t stand up. The redneck was wearing the lawyer’s suit, shirt and tie, his feet were in the lawyer’s shoes and socks; he was holding his briefcase, shaving with a razor he found in the briefcase and holding the keys to his BMW.

The lawyer mumbled “You look like me! What…. Why… Give me my clothes back! Take off my shoes! My car…What are you….”

But he was so drunk he couldn’t move.

Then he reached over and pulled the Rolex off the lawyer’s wrist and as a final touch, rubbed some dirt into the lawyer’s manicured hands and expensive haircut.

theonewhowrites,2,12,1qk3ei,0,"A factory worker dressed in overalls, sat down to have his lunch in a park across from his office.

Then he noticed a very distinguished and dignified man step out of a top of the line BMW, walk into the park and sit down a few feet away on the grass; he was extremely well dressed in a hand tailored Brioni pinstriped business suit, perfectly tied silk necktie, starched white dress shirt, monogrammed cuff links, silver tiepin, Rolex watch, immaculately polished black leather shoes and silk socks. He placed his expensive briefcase next to him and prepared for lunch.

“One of those executives, I’ll bet” thought the factory worker, and after introducing himself, he found out he was right not only an executive, but an investment banker!

The factory worker glanced at the banker’s shoes, glistening in the sunlight.

“You have those polished every day, don’t you?” he asked.

The Investment Banker nodded “Just about. I have to look good for the clients. These were handmade for me. The first thing people notice are your shoes, at least in my line of work. And I keep the shoeshine men busy!”

The factory worker snapped “What about the poor? A few shoeshines would pay for a lot food. You “suits” are all alike! Tell me something. How much money did you pay for those fancy shoes?”

The Investment Banker looked surprised and said calmly “Eight hundred dollars”

The factory worker yelled “Just for ONE pair of shoes! How are you helping out other people? Never trust a suit! And how much was that suit?”

The banker said quietly: “Well, it’s none of your business but it was two thousand for the suit and two hundred for the tie and two hundred for the shirt, since you ask. I help them through taxes, but we all have a personal responsibility. Brioni pinstripes are expensive.”

The factory worker said “I’m telling you, the poor only need a chance! You should be GIVING them money; they haven’t had your advantages!”

The Investment Banker shrugged and said “We all have to work for what we have. I have worked VERY hard for what I have.”

“I saw you get out of that car. Pretty classy!” said the factory worker. “That BMW would pay for several cheap cars!”

“Yes, it is a classy car” said the banker smiling and pulled out his computer. “I am trading stocks so I would prefer some privacy”

The factory worker said “Stocks! Look, poverty can happen to anyone! There’s no way you can know that from where you sit with your high and mighty job and your car and your hotshot clothes! If you were not a SUIT, you would KNOW that! You need to know what it’s like to NOT be a suit!”

The Investment Banker smiled and said “Keep talking if you want to. When I sleep, nothing wakes me – and I mean NOTHING! I sleep like a rock.”

The investment banker put down his computer, sighed, relaxed on the grass and fell into a deep sleep.

Then a barefoot homeless man appeared holding whiskey, and asked the factory worker for change. The factory worker apologized, and said he had nothing, but then he saw the investment banker’s wallet in his suit pocket.

He had an idea. He slipped the wallet out, and handed it to the homeless man, ID, credit cards and all.

Then he had another idea – a riskier one. He looked at the banker’s feet.

Why not! This is a Suit who needs to give to society! The homeless man needs shoes, and the banker definitely needs to be humbled. 

“What size shoe?” he asked the homeless man.

“Ten!” 

He looked again at the feet of the sleeping investment banker. “Wait! I’m sure you need these more than he does.” He then started to slowly untie the investment banker’s mirror polished $800 shoes and very slowly and very carefully pulled them off his feet.

He looked inside. “Size ten! You’re in luck! Give me your whiskey and I’ll give you the shoes”

“Deal!’ said the homeless man.

“You have to have socks to go with these shoes!” he said, “and he won’t be needing socks now!” 

And even more carefully, he reached up under the banker’s suit cuffs to his knees and peeled the thin black dress socks off the banker’s legs, heels, soles and finally his toes, and held them up like trophies. He handed both shoes and socks to the homeless man, who grinned.

The factory worker said: “With my compliments! They are handmade and they were just polished! Somebody told me that the first thing people notice are your SHOES!”

The factory worker took the bottle of whiskey.

The investment banker, now barefoot, yawned, stretched, but continued to sleep; soon he started to snore again, while the bum walked off in the banker’s shoes.

“I guess he won’t be seeing any more clients today, and he’ll have to miss that board meeting”, said the factory worker to himself, “but he’ll be a much better person now that he’s humbled! I’m changing his destiny!”

An old man walked by and stared at the sleeping banker and the contrast between the tailored suit and his bare feet; he laughed out loud and walked on.

Then a mugger ran by, holding on to money he had just stolen. “A victim of society!” thought the factory worker.

He slid the keys to the BMW out of the banker’s suit pocket, threw them to the mugger, and pointed to the car.

The mugger didn’t stop to ask questions – he just drove off.

Then the factory worker saw a sad woman with a baby walking by. 

“Can I help you?” he asked her. When he found out that she needed money for her rent, the factory worker again approached the snoring investment banker and removed his cuff links; then he slipped the tiepin out of the silk tie.

“His wristwatch will be worth plenty!” said the factory worker to himself, and slipped the Rolex off the banker’s manicured hand. He handed them all to the delighted woman. “Sell these!” the factory worker cried. “Oh, thank you sir” said the woman, and ran off.

“It’s the least I can do!” said the factory worker.

He then thought: “Well, he has no more fancy shoes, no socks, no keys, no car, no ID or credit cards or wristwatch or license or money. I guess I’m turning him from a Suit into something much better! I might as well finish the job!”

The factory worker then noticed the banker’s computer and the password on a piece of paper. He sold all of the banker’s stocks and bonds, and gave the money to the charities.

Next, a man in a janitor’s uniform walked by, looking dejected.

“What’s the matter, my friend?” said the factory worker sympathetically. “I..lost my job. I have a chance for a better one, but I don’t have the clothes! This is all I have!” and he held up a pair of old polyester pants.

The factory worker sighed, and then looked at the banker’s navy blue pinstriped business suit.

“Would this help? It’s a two thousand dollar suit! A Brioni!” he asked the man.

“Sure!” cried the man “But how are you going to strip it off him?”

“Just watch and see!” said the factory worker.

He very slowly moved one of the banker’s arms and then the other and the banker rolled on to his stomach, still sleeping and removed the suit jacket.

“You could use a briefcase, too!” said the factory worker and opened up the investment banker’s briefcase.

He removed the contents and handed it to the joyful man. He also gave him the banker’s Blackberry and computer and password. Then he looked at the banker’s expensive silk tie and white shirt. Could he manage it?

He had to move the banker again a few times, but he only snored and slept as he untied the tie and pulled off the shirt. Then he unbuttoned the banker’s suspenders and pulled them off.

Triumphantly he handed the starched white shirt, suspenders and necktie to the man, leaving their formerly well-dressed owner in his t-shirt.

“Wait” the factory worker said. “You really need the full suit. Give me a hand and I’ll need those polyester pants. I’m getting good at this. taking his suit pants off him will be the hardest job yet” and with great care and trouble, set to work removing the suit trousers. 

Ten minutes later, the man was holding up the full pinstriped suit with admiration while its former owner was reduced to wearing the polyester pants.

He thanked the factory worker profusely and ran off, who brushed off his words: “I’m always glad to help those who need it! I’ve always been generous!”

“How good it is to help people!” he said to himself. “And mister hotshot isn’t a “Suit” anymore!”

He sprinkled some of the whiskey on the banker’s shirt and hair and placed the bottle next to him.

Twenty minutes later, a policeman walks up to the formerly impeccably dressed investment banker, slapped him on the soles of his naked size tens and snapped: “Hey buddy, wake up, no loitering! We don’t allow drunk bums to sleep here. I can smell it from here!”
Finally the investment banker woke up with a start and looked down at himself with astonishment.

There was nothing left of the perfectly dressed banker he had been when he fell asleep. He was barefoot, and wearing only cheap trousers and a t-shirt. It took him a moment to realize that his suit, shoes, socks, tie, shirt, watch, jewelry, money, credit cards, ID, computer and briefcase had all been stripped from him.

He turned to the factory worker in astonished fury. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! WHERE IS MY SUIT, MY TIE, MY SHIRT! WHERE ARE MY SHOES AND SOCKS!? MY BRIEFCASE! MY WALLET! HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY OFFICE LIKE THIS!? I LOOK LIKE A BUM! I smell like a bum too!”

The factory worker then told him about his car and stocks. The banker began to yell.

The policeman then turned to the factory worker and said “Is this bum disturbing you?” and grabbed the struggling investment banker by the arm and says: “You can sleep it off in the tank, buddy! Vagrancy, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, harassment!”

At that moment, his boss walked by on a stroll, saw his bedraggled employee being dragged away and cried out, “What are you doing?! You’re fired!”

Three months later, the factory worker wandered into the park, and saw the homeless man on the corner, as usual, wearing the same gleaming black shoes and socks, but now there was a new panhandler with him, barefoot with matted hair and a grizzled face, wearing polyester pants and a T-shirt. 

“It can’t be!” he says, as he walked up to him. But it is.

The homeless man looked up and winked: “He’s one of us now!” he said laughing “And I’m even wearing HIS fancy shoes!”

The expensive haircut and the manicure were gone, along with everything else, and the former investment banker is now an unemployed homeless bum with a criminal record; he had been thrown out of his condo and his wife had left him. It’s hard to believe this was the same confident man in the expensive suit and the polished shoes he had seen that day in the park.

“I have been stripped of everything and my life is destroyed. Spare change, sir? Can I give you a shoeshine?” said the banker-turned-panhandler, without looking up. He pulled out a shoeshine kit.

“Forget it!” snapped the factory worker. “Get a job! Those Suits! They never think it will happen to them!”

The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank’s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?” The blond replies…..”Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?”",Who doesn't enjoy a blonde joke,21

 Now this is before all the austerity stuff was really kicking in,and he fells like he deserves a bit of a treat since hes been doing some great Popeing lately so he wanders into the Mercedes dealership and like a good German Lad,heads directly to the AMG`s.

And there is the one he figures will be a great upgrade.It's white, so it still goes with the uniform,but it's a 700 horse power twin superchaged monster of a car.Not exactly practical,but the Holy Father reckons he could get the back end redone with a nice low profile glass box for waving and blessing.

So he talks to the dealer,who is pretty awestruck that the Pope,..*The FUCKING POPE!* is in his dealership asking about zero to sixty times.

""Whats it's top speed?""
""Is it much of a hassel to disable the speed limiters?""

Then the Pope asks,""Can we go for a test run?"" and ""Do you think I could drive? The Cardinals never let me up front when I'm working.""

Well,the dealer is not going to say no to the Pope,even though company policy is as definative as Leviticus on the subject of clients in the driverseats of the high end performance models.He say's ""Sure thing your Holiness"" and they head out for a quick spin around Rome.

Well its not long before the special red leather papal slippers are putting far to much torque to the road and then of course **Wha wha,Wha wha,** up pops the Law on a bike from nowhere and he pulls over the crisp white AMG and saunters over to the car with ticket book in hand.

""Drivers licence and regis,......""
The Policeman does a double take,and tries again,but words fail him,Looks at the Driver..is that?....No it can't be,....but,....Looks at the passenger,the driver again.

After a moments confused silence he just raises a finger and says ""Excuse me please ,I'll just be one moment.""

And so he does the best thing he could do in this situation,call the base and ask them what he should do.

""Okay, just give me your credit card number and address and a representative will be with you shortly.""

After giving her his details, he waits a couple of hours until he hears a knock at the door. Standing outside is a gorgeous, completely naked woman.

""If you can catch me, you can have me,"" she whispers seductively. Pushing past him into the house, she begins to run around playfully. The fat man chases her as quickly as he can but his overweight condition means he is barely managing to crawl by the time he catches her and does what he wants with her.

Afterwards, the woman says ""Quick, check the scales!"" and sure enough, he's lost 5 kg.

The next day he rings up again and says ""I want to lose 10 kg!"" so he gives them his credit card number and waits. Soon there is another knock at the door and this time an even more beautiful woman is standing there, yet again completely naked.

""If you can catch me, you can have me,"" she mouths seductively as she runs into the house. This one is even faster than the last one and the man is about to collapse when he finally grabs her and does what he wants with her.

Afterwards she says ""Quick, check the scales!"" and sure enough he's lost 10 kg.

The next day he once again rings up and says ""I want to lose 15 kg!""

‘Al-Gebra is a problem for us’, the Attorney General said. ‘They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.’ They use secret code names like “X” and “Y” and refer to themselves as “unknowns” but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.

One day, he got an assignment from the local mob to take out a man who owed huge amounts of money and was refusing to pay it back. Artemis took the job, but the man turned out to be almost impossible to find. The target would seemingly vanish whenever Artemis was in the vicinity and tracking him was practically impossible.

However, one day Artemis got a call from his boss. The man had been spotted at a local Kroger and, since nobody knew when he would appear again, Artemis was to strangle the man in the store. Artemis was reluctant at first, but he was getting very tired of the long project and agreed to track the man inside.

Luckily, Artemis was able to corner the man in the produce aisle and strangle him. Unluckily, just as he was laying the man's body down, a woman came around the corner. Artemis panicked and in his desperation strangled the woman, only to see a poor store clerk out of the corner of his eye. Artemis strangled this man too. Finally, a manager came around the corner and also met his end.

All of this became too much for Artemis to cover up and he was arrested outside of the store. The next day, the local paper ran the headline:

The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. However, Benny decided to rub the urn with his sleeve, thinking he might be able to get a few coins out of it. But suddenly, out of the urn came a Genie!

The genie stretched and yawned and said: ""Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.""

""Why?"" said Benny.

""Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.""

So Benny thought for a while and said, ""Ok, I want some new threads."" And thus he got a fancy toga. And then he said ""I could use a new house."" And a fancy mansion made of fine marble popped up.

Finally, Benny said: ""And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.""

The genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: ""Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn. That's how I ended up like this. Deal?""

""Deal,"" said Benny.

So the Genie granted his wish and Benny began wandering the world. He saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from China to Germany to Canada to Brazil. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.

But one day, Benny came across a beautiful woman on the beach. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.

One day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.

""Benny,"" she said, ""I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up eight seats.""

Benny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought. Who would notice if he cut his hair and shaved his beard. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought 400 disposable razors and 25 cans of shaving cream.

He went into the bathroom, and waved to his girlfriend, saying he'd be out in a bit. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. Then suddenly, it all went quiet.

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on 
that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 

It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.
 I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 

We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 

She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
