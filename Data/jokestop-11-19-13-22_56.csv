TheOneWeirdGuy,217,4959,1bsmi0,3042,"She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.
She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.
Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.

She quietly called him over to her..

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots.""

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks.""

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.

""Now take off my skirt.""

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.
""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

""So, you're a politician...""
""Well, yes, is that a problem?""
""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"" 

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician.
""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.
""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!""
""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.
Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...""
Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.
""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.
So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""
""No sir!"" says the man.
""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"".
""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician.
""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.
""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

They even gave the child her very own hard hat and gloves, which thrilled her immensely.

At the end of the first week, the smiling builders presented her with a pay envelope - containing two pounds in 10p coins. The little girl took

her 'pay' home to her mother who suggested that they take the money to the bank the next day to open a savings account.

At the bank, the female cashier was tickled pink listening to the little girl telling her about her 'work' on the building site and the fact she had a 'pay packet'.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,' the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'it's going to be a very cold winter.'

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

""Welcome to heaven,"" says St.. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

""No problem, just let me in,"" says the Senator.

""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

""Really? I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the Senator.

""I'm sorry, but we have our rules.""

And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.

In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.

Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the
expense of the people.

They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.

Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.

They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go.

So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time
and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.

""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.""

The Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.""

In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock.

They only have $600 left. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'

The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office and says, 'I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.'

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'It's just 99 cents a word.' Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.

After a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'I want you to send her the word 'comfortable.'

The operator shakes his head. 'How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'

She responds, ""no, I haven't.  But to stay at the top of my profession, I'm always looking to improve.  If you teach me how to have sex the Jewish way, we'll do that free of charge"".

Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1 000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero. 

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins.

In the stream, a salmon was swimming, and it looked up and saw the fly. It thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, I'd be able to jump up, catch it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Alongside the stream, a bear was standing. The bear looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, and I could jump out, snag that salmon, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Across the stream, up a steep slope, a hunter was hidden in the brush.

Hidden in the grass behind the hunter was a mouse.

A bit higher up the slope, on a jutting rock, sat a pussy cat.

At that moment, the fly dropped down about a half an inch. The salmon leapt up and caught the fly, the bear leapt out and snagged the salmon, the hunter jumped up and shot the bear, the mouse hopped out and started to eat the hunter's sandwich, and the pussy cat leapt down to catch the mouse...but it missed.

Approaching the car, he notices that there are five elderly ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back, wide-eyed and white as ghosts.  The driver, obviously confused, says to him, ""Officer, I don't understand. I was going the exact speed limit. What seems to be the problem?""

The trooper, trying to contain a chuckle, explains to her that 22 was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.

I'll tell ya, my wife and I, we don't think alike. She donates money to the homeless, and I donate money to the topless!

One night I came home. I figured, let my wife come on. I'll play it cool. Let her make the first move. She went to Florida. 

I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, ""Wait til it gets warmer.""

My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror. I drink too much. Way too much. My doctor drew blood. He ran a tab.

When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm very sorry. We did everything we could...but he pulled through.""

I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!

My father was stupid. He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.

My mother had morning sickness after I was born.

My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.

My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.

When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.

I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.

One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.

I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.

My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting on his lap. He was in the electric chair.

One time I went to a hotel. I asked the bellhop to handle my bag. He felt up my wife!

This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the Fruit of the Loom guys laughing at me.

I'm a bad lover. Once I caught a peeping tom booing me.

My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night she used me to time an egg.

It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass!

My wife isn't very bright. The other day she was at the store, and just as she was heading for our car, someone stole it! I said, ""Did you see the guy that did it?"" She said, ""No, but I got the license plate.""

Last night my wife met me at the front door. She was wearing a sexy negligee. The only trouble was, she was coming home. 

A girl phoned me and said, ""Come on over. There's nobody home."" I went over. Nobody was home!

A hooker once told me she had a headache.

I went to a massage parlor. It was self service.

If it weren't for pick-pocketers, I'd have no sex life at all.

Once when I was lost I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said, ""I don't know kid. There are so many places they can hide.""

I remember I was so depressed I was going to jump out a window on the tenth floor. They sent a priest up to talk to me. He said, ""On your mark...""

I went to see my doctor... Doctor Vidi-boom-ba. Yeah...I told him once, ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me? He said, ""I don't know, but your eyesight is perfect.""

I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown necktie.

My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, ""If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion."" He said, ""All right. You're ugly too!""

I was so ugly, my mother used to feed me with a slingshot!

When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, ""Look, twins!""

And we were poor too. Why, if I wasn't born a boy, I'd have nothing to play with!

With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.

I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants. She dropped her price.

I tell you, I'm not a sexy guy. I was the centerfold for Playgirl magazine. The staples covered everything!

What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me!

Last week I told my psychiatrist, ""I keep thinking about suicide."" He told me from now on I have to pay in advance.

I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back! 

Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor. I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.

When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, ""We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again.""

I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over!

I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him, ""I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills."" He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 

Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt because he leaves a pyramid in every room.

With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.

What a dog I got. His favorite bone is in my arm!

As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!

""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".

""OK"", I nervously replied.

So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

""Over the years, many misconceptions of heaven have arose. Yes, it's a pretty nice place. No, its not perfect, but its close. You see the only problem are the ducks.

Just as Peter had said, the duck began to quack and then the ducks around him began an audible tidal wave of quacks. 

Soon after the quacks had passed, Saint Peter approached the men in hand with a hag of a woman. Without a word, he shackled the hag to the man that stepped on the duck and left.

The other two men were careful not to step on a duck. Although they tried there best, one of them eventually stepped on a duck. The same phenomenon of before arose and Saint Peter arrived again with a huge amazonian woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left.

I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

sons.  Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of
the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow waslying dead in the field.  The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.  When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the
hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the
cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank.  She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.  But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had
happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.  The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven
times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him
in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.  And there he also met the mermaid.  ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.""

""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.""  The angel shackles the two together and flies off. 

After seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud ""QUACK"" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. 

The third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, ""Wow!  What did I do to deserve this?""  And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies ""I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!""",Three friends die and go to heaven,1830

lobroblaw,91,927,znew0,1288,"Why I fired my secretary:

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say,
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!""
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

We had just finished a mission and field maintenance and had about an hour of down-time before our next briefing, so the whole platoon was in a tent sitting on cots in a circle just bullshitting. One of the sergeants, a particularly vulgar guy, starts telling some nasty and offensive jokes which starts the whole platoon off on a spree of similar jokes.  We had a Lieutenant, my LT,  who was not a fan of these kinds of jokes and was getting aggravated as each joke began to get more and more vulgar.  Every joke we knew from blonde to women to racist to dead baby jokes and he would openly display his dislike for these jokes with comments like, ""that's not funny,"" or, ""that's just wrong.""  Eventually, he had hit his limit right after a PFC told a holocaust joke, saying, ""why did Hitler really kill himself?""  One of the other sergeants asked, ""why?""  The private responded with, ""because of the gas bill.""  At this point, the LT was very disturbed and stated, ""do you know how horrible that is?  Millions of people died in camps and you are laughing about being gassed?""  One of the other privates who hadn't done much talking immediately says to the LT, ""yeah sir, my grandfather died in a concentration camp.""  Everyone kind of gets quiet because we weren't sure really what to say, the LT looks at him and puts a hand on his shoulder and says, ""I'm so terribly sorry for how insensitive everyone was being towards you, I sincerely apologize for the whole platoon.""  Without missing a beat in an amazingly deadpan poker face, the private looks at my LT and says, ""the drunk bastard fell out of a guardtower.""  The entire platoon was falling out of cots, rolling on the floor laughing to the point of crying at that magnificent set-up.  The LT just stands up, says ""watch my cot,"" and walks out of the tent.  The laughter must have continued for about 5 minutes.

The LT eventually came around and understood, he's going to be around soldiers and these jokes will be told.  I'm sure the ""drunk bastard"" line for that joke has been used, but in that situation, it was absolutely hilarious.",The best situation set-up I've ever heard in real life..,1959

At the next hole he told me to use my five iron. It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever.

 Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had finished the cider and the liquor.

 In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the liquor bottle, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.

 Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa stomped to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

 The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?'

...The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. 

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response. 

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.' 

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response. 

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really don't think you should make him mad.'

refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

UncleArthur,42,306,1g2byt,998,"...Paddy married a woman, Maggie, half his age.

All was well at first until Maggie took delivery of a 'woman's magazine and began to read things about sex. It soon became clear that she had never climaxed during sex and, according to her Grandmother, all Irish women are entitled to a climax once in a while.

To resolve the problem, Paddy and Maggie went to see the Veterinarian since there was no doctor within thirty miles who could be relied upon not to gossip. However, the Vet didn't have a clue about people. But he did recall during hot summers, his mother and father would fan a cow that was having difficulty breeding with a big towel. 
Apparently, this cooled her down and helped her to relax. So he recommended they hire a strong, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, should cause the young wife to cool down, relax and possibly achieve the sought after climax.

So the couple hired a strong young man from Dublin to wave a huge bath towel over them as the Vet suggested. After many efforts, Maggie still had not climaxed so they went back to the Vet who suggested she change partners and let the young man have a go while Paddy waved the big towel.

They tried it that night and Maggie went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.

When it was over, Paddy looked down at the exhausted young man and said loudly: ""And dat, me auld son, is how ya wave a feckin' towel!""","Some years ago, in a small coastal Irish community...",1304

As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.
Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. 
And, next to them, a single red rose!! Jack sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.
He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house.
He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. 
Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: 
“Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian”.
He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His 16 year old son is also at the table, eating.
Jack asks, “Son… what happened last night?”
“Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, 
and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.”

really pissed.

She told him ""Tomorrow morning, I expect to find a gift in the

He knows his wife is always getting horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her having sex with someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation to the old man.

“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except a” said the old man, and then he stopped.

“Except what?” asked the businessman.

“Nothing, it's nothing,” said the old man.

“Please, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘Voodoo Dildo,’” the old man said.

“The Voodoo Dildo?” the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out a beautifully ornate old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like any other dildo in this shop!”

The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo Dildo, the door.”

The Voodoo Dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo Dildo, box!”

The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the Voodoo Dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.

Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she hastily cried, ""The Voodoo Dildo! stuck in my pussy, can't get it out!! Ahhhhh! Need..To..Get..It..OUT!! H-h-help M-m-me!!!""

bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the
itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal
Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen
that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this
type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, 

only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their
chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he
put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on

eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and was hailed by the King and Queen

-Come on, lets do it!

-Why?

-Maybe the other travelling people will be bothered and awoken by it.

-No, they won't! They're all sleeping like pigs. Let me show you. ANYONE GOT A LIGHTER?"" See, no one answered, because they are all sleeping.

-Alright, let's go.

-No, I didn't sleep very well at all.

freejumps,78,376,zx8rl,816,"An Irish Golfer playing in Ireland hooked his
Drive into the woods. Looking for his ball,
He found a little Leprechaun flat on his back,
A big bump on his head and the golfer's ball
Beside him.
Horrified, the golfer got his water bottle from
The cart and poured it over the little guy,
Reviving him.

'Arrgh! What happened?' the Leprechaun asked.

'I'm afraid I hit you with my golf ball,' the golfer says.

'Oh, I see. Well, ye got me fair and square.
Ye get three wishes, so whaddya want?'

'Thank God, you're all right!' the golfer
Answers in relief. 'I don't want anything,
I'm just glad you're OK, and I apologize.'
And the golfer walks off.

'What a nice guy,' the Leprechaun says to himself..

I have to do something for him. I'll give him
The three things I would want... A great golf game,
All the money he ever needs, and a fantastic sex life.'

A year goes by and the golfer is back.
On the same hole, he again hits a bad drive into
The woods and the Leprechaun is there waiting for him.

'Twas me that made ye hit the ball here',
The little guy says. 'I just want to ask ye,
how's yer golf game?'

'My game is fantastic!' the golfer answers.
I'm an internationally famous golfer now.'
He adds, 'By the way, it's good to see you're
All right.'

'Oh, I'm fine now, thank ye. I did that fer yer
Golf game, you know. And tell me, how's yer money
Situation?'

'Why, it's just wonderful!' the golfer states.
'When I need cash, I just reach in my pocket
And pull out $100 bills I didn't even know were there!'

'I did that fer ye also.' And tell me, how's yer sex life?'

The golfer blushes, turns his head away in embarrassment,
And says shyly, 'It's OK.'

C'mon, c'mon now,' urged the Leprechaun,
'I'm wanting to know if I did a good job
How many times a week?'

Blushing even more, the golfer looks around then whispers,
'Once, sometimes twice a week.'

'What??' responds the Leprechaun in shock.
'That's all? Only once or twice a week?'

Heterohabilis,25,206,1eka59,804,"A bush-pilot drops Bob and Ted, two moose hunters, at a remote lake in Northern Ontario.  He tells them that he’ll be back in a week, and warns them that his plane won’t be able to take off with more than one moose.

The next week he returns, and sure enough the hunters have bagged two moose.  The pilot tells them there’s no way they can take off with the two moose.

Ted says, “I don’t know, the pilot last year took off with two moose.”

To which Bob adds, “Yeah, but maybe he wasn’t a total pussy!”

Not wanting to be outdone, the pilot loads up everything and they start to move down the lake.  

The plane is gathering speed, but the pines on the shore are rapidly approaching.  Finally the plane gets airborne, but one wing clips the top of a tree.  The plane spins, crashes into the trees, and breaks apart.

Sometime later Ted regains consciousness and begins searching for his buddy.  He finds him, and when he wakes him up Bob asks, “Do you have any idea where we are?”

Ted replies, “I think about 200 yards further than last year.”
