Osiris,405,2384,1d8v0y,4711,Some of you may recognize this story since I posted it before elsewhere but again this is the perfect sub for it  And its a happy story  We all like happy storiesThis story starts long ago in the dim ages when bear and bison swarmed the forest and the prairie  Or about  which ever you prefer  I was working at a sporting goodsautomotive store at the time at the customer service counter  A father and his son who appeared to be about  came in and asked where the camping equipment was  I pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up Im going on my first Boy Scout campoutNow if youve read my other stories youll know that Im an Eagle Scout  I take this position very seriously and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young scouts on their trail to Eagle  So I looked over at my boss a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting and asked if I could go help these people personally  She smiled and said yesThe father was COMPLETELY out of his element with camping gear  By his attitude and behavior I would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life  Everything in the aisle perplexed him but thankfully his sons troop had given them a list of what equipment theyd need  So for about  minutes or so I went through the list with them point by point explaining what each thing was what it did what version to use and how Kybo Tape is the scout term for toilet paper  That got quite a bit of laughterDuring this time I also talked with the kid  He was very new to scouting only having joined a couple months prior  He was enthusiastic about getting to go out into the wilderness and camp and make campfires and fish and all the other activities hed heard about  I talked about my experiences in scouting which was all of what he was talking about and so much more  Climbing Mt Hood going to National Jamboree touring military bases rafting down the Deschutes the kid was very impressed  I kept telling him this is only the start you have no idea how awesome it can getSo we finally have a cart filled with a small tent sleeping bag cooking equipment small first aid kit beginner backpack rope you and yer fuckin rope shovel water bottle etc etc etc  Quite a haul but Id done my best to get everything that the kid would need while still keeping things cheap  Well cheapishThe total was something like a bit over   Now they say that a picture is worth a thousand words but if I could have taken a picture of the dads face when the total came up it would be worth a MUCH longer essay  It was a shockfearresignation combination that said damn I didnt expect it to be this much  But hes so excited I cant tell him no it would break his heart  Maybe if I just eat ramen for the next couple weeks I can afford this  As dad reached  reluctantly for his wallet I flashed him a smile looked at my boss and knocked  off the total  A scout is helpful and kind I quoted  The father thanked me profusely as did the son  They left with a spring in their step and smiles on their faces  My boss said that was very nice but dont ever do that again  I replied but boss you do realized that from now on they are going to be in here on a regular basis to buy camping equipment right  I know that kids look hes just like me at that age and hes going to be spending a LOT of dads money here  She laughed agreed and the deed was put out of my mind as other customers approachedBut the story isnt done yet dear reader  For about a week later look who comes running through the door but our little firsttime camper with dad trailing along  This kid very specifically wanted to see ME because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me  Awwww sweet  Sure lets take a lookhey I know this camp  I know exactly where you were  So we talked about being at that camp and taking the hike down the hill to the old camp location and how the fishing in the lake is and the deer that just dont care that you are around and how the chow hall seems to be made mostly of sieves given how drafty it is  We had a brag board up for the hunters who had trophy hunts so I pinned a couple of the better pictures to the board  This kid beamed with pride then ran off to use the bathroomThis is when dad chimed in and thanked me for a much more personal reason  He and the kids mom had gone through a fairly nasty divorce and she had majority custody  Scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them  He got a little choked up about it as did I  I simply told him this is what scouting is all about  Help other people at all times  This is just the tip of the icebergOver the next year they became regulars of the store  I knew which troop they were with a large and active one so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies  More pictures got posted to the brag board  His first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the Mile Swim badge  I started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor and had a great timeHowever real life gets in the way  School and a couple of new jobs meant I couldnt devote the time I needed to to help his troop out  We basically drifted apart and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dadUntil late in   I get a phone call out of the blue  The voice on the other end is deeper self confident  Is Osiris there  Yeah thats me who is this  Its that young scout from the store calling me up to invite me to his Eagle Court of Honor  I stood there in my kitchen in mute shock  All those memories of helping him out came flooding back  You better believe Ill be there  Ill even try to fit into my old uniformAnd so I did  Though I eschewed the shorts and went for pants  This young boy now turned into a young man stood tall and proud as they pinned the Eagle Medal to his shirt recited the Eagle Charge and gave a short speech thanking people whod made a difference in his life  He looked right at me as he gave the speech pointed me out and said this guy right here he was the first adult to encourage me  His example as an Eagle was what I followed  I cannot thank him enough  Tears flowedFollowing the ceremony I found his dad  Scouting had made both of them better people  Hed decided that being bitter towards his kids mom wasnt what a scout leader oh yeah he was now an assistant scoutmaster the bug bites very hard should be doing  This had allowed their divorce to become more amicable and they had successfully renegotiated custody some time earlier  He was a happier man and was so proud of his son I was pretty sure his chest was going to burst  His son now tall strong confident and an obvious leader was destined to go places  He would be graduating high school the next spring and was looking at getting into college for a degree in psychology with a minor in criminal justice  He wanted to live his Oath and Law by being a police officer  My own chest felt like it was going to burst at this pointI still keep in touch with him  Hes now coming up on his st birthday and is readying applications for various police departments around town  Ive already told him that Id gladly be his reference because hes one of the guys we all want to become a cop someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty honor integrity generosity and kindness of spirit  Hell make a damn fine officer and I can say that a little part of that just a little part is because of my willingness to help him choose tents one day several years agoTLDR  Just read it itll do your soul

SonaOrAFK,158,444,18e1ew,2596,Back in my old video game job where we were Crazy about Games we used to have a policy that customers could try out any game in the store It really helped cut down on returns This meant however that we would get a few customers who would abuse this policy Enter Draconian I dont know his real name I just know that every character he made on any game and the Xbox profile he set up on our demo unit was named Draconian He was a late teensearly s man child About  and overweight He would come in almost daily and spend hours playing games rarely purchasing anythingWhen this happened The Elder ScrollsOblivion had come out Draconian was coming in daily and spent literally hours standing in one spot and playing the game I would inform him every half hour or so that he needed to take a break and could just play games all day He would save walk away for a minute and jump right back to it when I started working on something else After a few days of this I was tired of him The next time he came in he played Oblivion for a solid  hours I didnt bother him once When he finally took his leave of the game and I was sure he was gone I loaded up his game and dumped almost a weeks worth of progress in one part of the map Warped him across the map to the woods and left his character naked and alone Deleted every save file except this one and shut the game offThe next time Draconian came in he asked to play Oblivion I gladly obliged put the game in and walked away I can still remember him sputtering and frantically trying to search for a way to get his progress back He was nearly in tears as he left minutes afterTLDR Customer abuses store policy so I leave him naked in the woods,A gamer lost in the woods,3040

fhqwhgads,372,1097,1mhutw,2439,My story requires a little bit of a prelude to know how things work in the restaurant I work atI work at a Mongolian Grill all you can eat buffet There is a huge buffet of raw vegetables means and sauces You throw what you want in a bowl and bring it up to the grill We fit about  meals on the grill at a time and everyone stands in line waiting for their meal to be cooked When it is almost done we go to the first meal on the grill and offer teriyaki to the first person in line and then the second and so on Fairly regularly people decide not to stand in line and then fail to correct us if we are pointing at a meal that doesnt belong to them and ask if they want teriyaki on said meal So mistakes happen Enter MegaBitchMB is here with her family All their meals are on the grill but she does not stay in order but switches with her son Her son wants teriyaki she does not But being switched she gets it She points out the mistake and the cook fortunately I was not cooking at this time while normally I would be apologizes profusely and offers her another bowl She refuses the bowl and proceeds to curse about what a fucking moron he is doing so loudly so the whole restaurant can hear She refuses to eat although her family sits down to eat She complains loudly the entire meal When they go to pay she complains to the hostess and she offered to comp their drinks The woman demanded that their food be free because of the terrible service they received The hostess tells her The cook offered you another bowl they tried to fix the problem no one treated you horribly The woman retorts something like Im going to get online and write a terrible review of this place The hostess smiles at her and says Good You do that probably holding back laughter at the woman by this point And then out of nowhere and right over her son she punched the hostess square in the faceThen her and her family left One of the waitresses ran outside and got the license plate number Not only that they paid with a Groupon So it was easy to track her down The police arrested her and the hostess pressed chargesWhats really great is that a few months before that hostess had been in a car accident that fucked up her neck and it wasnt healed yet That punch which normally one could take quite well sent her physical therapy back to stage  which made it count as a new injury which made that womans punch assault And that punch being thrown over her child counted as child endangerment The best part She was a special needs teacher And with a felony charge you cant work with kids so as a result she also lost her jobIm shocked anyone could be that aggressive More so that such a person worked with kids But I am extremely happy her life is completely fucked up nowEDIT I meant it became a felony not that it became an assault My bad,Good you do that,3536

webusmaster,154,410,14ujd8,2342,So I was a  yr old shift manager at a pizza place and was upset that the only way to make more money was to become an assistant manager and be put on salary and work  hours a week One day my boss asked if I would interview a  year old girl for a position we had She said she would hire her if I think they would do well I sit down to interview the goth Imagine the girl with a dragon tattoo about lbs heavier and more face rings She was wearing a uniform for the fastfood joint down the road The conversation goes something like this So i see your wearing a uniform Are you still working for them No i just walked out because they were being dumb Being dumb What do you mean by that They were being dumb because they were asking too many questions Awkward pause Well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions So what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place Well I like pizza After the interview I decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day My boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her The next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad The goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face My boss told me to deal with it So i go out and tell the goth she has to change When asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away The goth busted out laughing She actually went home and changed We put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth A month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm she always wore long sleeve shirts I asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal Come to find out she was having the typical no one understands me and my parents just dont understand issues most kids have she was just taking it to an extreme I told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor She actually did it In a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about  months She became an invaluable member of the team i helped her filter what she said and to consider others and life was grand About  months later i finish up at a Jr college and am moving away to go to big people college and its my last day at pizza place The girl pulls me into the back and just begins to sob She says Thank you Mr Webus for giving me a chance when no one else would You saw past the thing i was and saw the woman i could be If it wasnt for you i would not have a job i would not have moved out of my parents house and Id probably be dead by now I just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend My heart about imploded on itself I felt so guilty Here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss I hired her as a joke I decided not to tell her I figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares Fast forward a few years later and Im in my profession going out to lunch and i hear MR WEBUSMASTER MR WEBUSMASTER It was her again Her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black She is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker She said she wanted to help others who were in her situation I almost cried Felt i would share this with you reddit If the end justifies the means then why do i feel so guiltyTlDR Hired a maniacal goth as a joke and accidentally changed her life,A goth a guy and a pizza place,2752
FredFltStn,155,1130,1n146r,2325,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square foot of fireworks heavenTwo years ago a woman stopped in to get some stuff to give to her kids as Christmas presents She had two boys  amp  and wanted me to help her pick out some stuff I showed her some of the smaller things but she actually ended up buying a big mortar kit for the kids figuring that she could help them light them off and it would be more impressive A few days after Christmas she came back and told me this storyIt was just her and the kids and they had had a great Christmas She thought her younger son would be excited by the fireworks so shed let him open it but after he had ripped off the wrapping paper and seen what it was he didnt really say anything about it She was sitting across the room from him and asked him what the present was that Santa had gotten him He mumbled something and set the box aside She was a little disappointed that he wasnt more excited but she didnt say anything and they continued ripping open giftsLater that morning after the gift hurricane had died down she decided to ask him about the fireworks and went to grab the box She couldnt find it in the pile of presents and she didnt see it in his room Its a good sized box about  ft tall and  inches wide so it shouldnt have been hard to spot She asks her son about the big box that Santa had gotten him and he just shrugged his shouldersIt turns out he had hidden the box under his bed When hed opened the present he had quickly reasoned that if his mom found out that Santa had given him a big box of fireworks she would take them away He had played it cool and hidden the box when she wasnt looking Truly a child after my own heart,Shopper told me this story about something she had gotten her kids from my store,3455
SassyVelociraptor,281,741,1koped,2236,Id love to say that this was my idea but I was only a witness to this moment of geniusI was queuing in the ten items or less line in a wellknown UK supermarket chain Just as the cashier was helping one elderly customer bag her items with the next guy about to unload his items onto the counter a short woman in a business suit pushed her way in between him and the cashier I heard her mumble to him Just grabbing lunch Im running late before chucking her meal deal which consisted of a sandwich a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps onto the counter I should clarify that I was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunchesAs the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card the guy who was supposed to be next in line  without saying a single word to the queuejumper  picked her bottle of juice off the counter knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue She turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue too Her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity She couldnt legitimately complain because she along with everyone around her was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do Plus there was a whole queue of hungry British people observing her now She stared daggers at the guy she tried to skip picked up her sandwich then storming off a whole five metres to pick the rest of her lunch off the floor then disappeared back into the aisles in a fit of embarrassed rage The tension generated in those few moments made me feel proud to be British I still dont know if she managed to buy her lunch that day,The best way to deal with queuejumpers,2977
LittleBadass,156,671,1b0bhy,2106,Long time reader first time poster blah blah blah   Its long so feel free to ignoreI have always lived in the city but moved to a very small rural town last year  Lots of farms ranches and woods  Im actually growing to love it  Except for the community of rich entitled people who come down on the weekends  Thankfully I do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal  Ive had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store both with the same amazing witnessFirst one  I was shopping on a Friday afternoon a few months ago stocking up regular stuff as well as a planned party for my SOs coworkers so the total came to about   I had been helping bag everything as it was being rung up  The clerk finished gave me the total but before I could move the woman in line behind me stomped forward swiped her card and punched in her PIN then went back to yacking on her phoneI just stood there for a moment looking at her  I finally said Excuse me  She cut this glare at me and turned away  So again Excuse me  And I get I am on the phone God some people are so rudeYou want rude bitch  I was just wondering why you paid for my groceries Not that I dont really appreciate it  Her What  Im not paying for your shit  How dare you  What makes you think anyone would just pay for you  Me Well you just did maam  You swiped your card and paid for my groceries  Her It doesnt matter when I swipe the card during the transaction  Me It does if shes still ringing up my transactionAnd now weve got a problem  Transaction is complete and yes she has paid for my  groceries  She actually got off the phone at that point  We get a manager over to try to figure out what to do  They end up deciding for the manager to do a complete return of the groceries to her card and then ring them up again so I can pay  And cue the bitching  Shes in a hurry her time is valuable this is ridiculous  So I toss in Lady at this point I could walk out the door  My groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused  Now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers  But there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman  Hes a solid  or more just a HUGE guy  Obvious biker  Black leather tshirt chains you name it  When I said that he cracked up laughing and said Wow youre a cute thing but you are a little badass arent youThe bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business  Thats it lady poke the grizzly bear  What could happen  And this guys face went from laughing to scary in a second flat    He told her Lady you need to just stand there quietly while they clean up the mess you made  I dont intimidate easily but even I was nervous  But then he smiled and winked at me  So the manager does the return and I chat with scary biker guy  He told me that he keeps telling his little girl that Its important to be polite but its also important to stand up for yourself  Every time the bitch woman made a noise like huffed or explosive sigh he made this little sound almost like a growl  The clerk offered to check him out a few times but he just stood there arms crossed a solid mountain of a man talking to me   Finally the return is done and the bitch has the nerve to ask So can I get checked out now  You are going to let me go first rightI just said no and the manager started reringing my stuff  Final dig  bitch started the I am never shopping here again do you know how much business you are going to lose  I glanced over her items and said What thirty  thirty five dollars  Oh my God they will have to lay off half their staff  Biker guy called me Little badass again and went to the next lane to pay for his stuff   Ive run into this guy a few times  Even met his wife and little girl once whos not much younger than I am  He calls me little badass every time Then came today  I just needed a few things so I run in on my way home  I got to the store and there are signs everywhere  And I mean everywhere  Both doors all across the front windows posted on several aisles and on every register  CASH ONLY  Computers not working all purchases must be paid in cash   Im good so I grab what I need and get in line there were only two open  In front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff   Everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook  Clerk  Uh maam youll need to pay cash our computers arent working  There are signsWoman  I saw those signs you can take a check its the same thing And tried to hand the check to the clerkClerk Maam I cant take that  We can only take cashWoman waved the check in the clerks face  Just take it  Its the same as cashAnd me Maam the only thing thats the same as cash is CASHWoman You stay out of this you filthy little bitchMe What the hellAnd enter biker guy and wife  Hey little badass I thought I heard your voice  How are you  We chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerks faceMe Lady seriously you need to pay with cash  They cannot take a check  A check is not the same as cashWoman turned Look you caught sight of biker guy and slammed her mouth shut  Glared for a second then says So what would you suggest I doMe Well there is a bank across the street another about a half mile that way another about that far that way  I would suggest you go get cashShe grumbled and slammed things around then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit  Gave me one more glare and stomped outBiker guy Still the little badass I see  Though I wish Id called you little ass kickerBikers wife She wont get that referenceMe sure I do  Its what Daryl called the baby when she was bornBiker guy just roared and yanked open his jacket to show me his Walking Dead T shirt  We ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last nights episode and what we thought was coming nextI should mention with the first incident I did think after I left the store that I could have gone to the ATM and pulled the cash to pay the bitch  But Im actually glad I didnt think of that so that I got to waste all her valuable time  If you actually read all this thanks hope you got a laugh  And hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dudeTLDR  Bikers are amazing defenders of little badasses who stand up to bitchy customersEdit Fixed the typo they bug me thanks for catching itEdit Sorry for the Walking Dead spoiler if anyone knows how to hide it please let me know  I didnt realize there were places that were so far behind usAnd for those who went there  I have a boyfriend that I moved to the middle of nowhere with  And Big Ass Biker Guy has a daughter about my age and a wife who is very nice but is a Big Ass

FredFltStn,134,1107,1nfvgn,2076,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square foot of fireworks heavenIve posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted if youre interestedSTORY  A guy came in to pick up some fireworks He was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends I spent about  minutes walking him through the store explaining the different items to him and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted He mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to ltother storegt and how their prices were cheaper Each time Id apologized but I let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs and that I thought that we had beat them on each of the items in questionThe third time it happened I walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from ltother storegt I found the stuff he had mentioned and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected and thats why I keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter In fact on a couple of items we were about half of ltother storegt price Amazingly he didnt seem happy about it but he kept shoppingBy the time he was ready to check out he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff It was mostly large assortment packages finale cakes and big mortar kits with a few smaller items here and there To speed things up and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter I started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier my dad About halfway through I got to one of the largest items a massive mortar kit and called out the price of  When my dad was ringing it in the register display looked like it had screwed up so I stopped him and went to check it out Sure enough the item had rung in at  While Im talking to my dad about it the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake I show him that the last entry was for  instead of  He immediately tells me that I have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up I showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it and that the cashier had just misskeyed it when he had rung it in The guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that I have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that I calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong I would sell it to him at the incorrect price but since it was just a misskey we would just void the last item rung in and do it again Now armchair lawyer guy ALG starts yelling that he knows his rights and that Im breaking the law if I have the cashier change the price and I dont sell it to him at the wrong priceNow Ive had the staff screw up before when doing pricing and if we put the wrong LOWER price tag on something thats what Im going to sell it to you for I also know that unless its an ADVERTISED price I dont LEGALLY have to do it but if I screwed up Im going to eat that mistake and reprice the item after were done  Side note to Josh C  Happy birthday today And next time pay attention to the damn price list when youre using the price gun because I know most of these screwups have your name on them Also go back to school and dont do drugsME  Are you telling me that legally even if we screwed up I cant have the cashier fix a mistake and that I have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the registerALG  YesME  looking at my dad I guess were going to have to charge him whatever you keyed inI calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart a small fountain with a price tag of  and continued calling out the prices When we were all done my dad gave him the totalALG  That cant be right Thats way too much Theres no way I got that much stuffDAD  Oops Looks like the fountain rang in for  Did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit cardALG just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix itWe happily fixed both mistakes boxed up his items and sent him on his way with a smile,Be careful what you demand because we might give it to you,3183
Lprsti,137,391,1947ml,2072,Quick backstory Ive been working at a grocery store for nearly  years now started when I was   The first four months or so I was a bagger then the managers had me crosstrained as a cashier  This story occurred about a week after that training  Guy walks into my line and in his rather large order is a large pack of chicken legs  Its one of the last items I ring up and as soon as I scan it he goes off saying that the associate in the market had told him it would be a different cheaper price  Hes pissed so I apologize and call my manager but he evidently wants to go bitch at the associate who told him the price so he grabs the pack and starts storming off towards the back  With his order still sitting in front of me  With a line of about ten people behind him  Im not sure what to do but before I can do anything the nothing lady who was behind him in line turns and at the top of her voice yells HEY Get the HELL back here and pay for your shitChicken guy stops dead in his tracks then turns around and comes back  He starts in on this lady but he also starts paying for his order as I recall he wrote a check  Hes going on Dont you ever fucking talk to me like that again you dont know who I am and shes giving it right back I dont give a fuck who you are you dont walk off like that you see this line  It continues like that them at each others throats and poor me just trying to finish the order and stay unnoticed  Finally his order finishes and he snatches his shit up and say Ill be waiting for you outside bitchShe looks him dead in the eye and says in a supremely unconcerned voice You go right ahead I carry a gun in my handbag motherfucker and then turns to me and as if nothings happened smiles and says Hi there  Could I have a pack of Marlboros please Chicken guy  slunk off quietly and judging by the lack of gunshots after the lady walked out quietly went home,Get the HELL back over here and pay for your shit,2463

advance if it didnt I have copied my stories from the ask reddit thread to start off with so you guys dont have to go back and searchSmelly Snatch amp Mannequin MolesterThe most shocking to me was when this older couple  came in reeking of black and milds and booze more so the wife than the husband The wife who had scraggly blonde hair missing teeth loose skin dripping everywhere from a recent weight loss and all around bad personal hygiene asked me to fit her for a bra cause it had been upwards for  years since she had bought a bra always willing to help I happily agreed We go into the fitting room and before I know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long and i mean loooooong tangled underarm hair so I measure her tell her size and she seems delighted So I leave her in the room and I go select a couple bras for her once I leave the room I see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse I let it go and go on the hunt for bras while Im looking he then starts yelling quite loudly i may add at how much would I be willing to sell the pretty young blonde for I politely told him they werent for sale etc etc but he still kept asking caressing and even sniffing the life sized mannequin So I smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife When I got in there she asked since I had measured her bust would I kindly measure her waist and hips cause shed like to know once again I agreed with a smile I was at her waist told her the number and she got so excited ya know cause of the weight loss I squatted down do reach her hips and BOOOOOM She pulls down her elastic banded mum jeans to reveal her large flurry matted muff About inches in front of my face was this womans vagina she was not wearing underwearObviously I couldnt do anything to upset her sensitive job and whatnot so I continued measuring around the sagging skin trying not to touch anything I didnt have to and then the smell hit me It was that old foosty musty old sock smell mixed with a fish market and some strong perfume I held my breath and told her the measurement and stood up so fast I got a head rush I then left her to her own devices to try on and went to get some sanitizer for my hands Of course the husband was still chatting up the mannequin but I just smiled and nodded at him and went about my business til she was doneTLDR Old foul smelling

smedwards,276,983,1hozyk,1965,I saw another thread on here earlier about customers assuming retail workers are stupid or unintelligent because of the field we work in and it reminded me of something that happened a few years ago when I was working in my senior year of high school I was working at a local chain bakery in a fairly upscale neighbourhood one Saturday when this happened For some backstory in our store our manager always told us to ask a lot of questions when people just asked for bread because otherwise customers had a habit of returning later and complainingtrying to score free stuff Im not talking a lot of questions either it was literally stuff like seeds or no seeds brown or white bread thick or thin slice and we always moved and worked while talking so we could provide fast serviceOne day I was working alone and this guy came in clearly in a massive hurry He was the only customer so I was doing my best to be courteous and get his items bagged up quickly for him asking the usual questions when he looks up and snaps at me Are you fucking stupid or something I just want a loaf of bread Youd better work on your customer service skills because it looks like youll be in sales for the rest of your life At this point Im kind of in shock because I was honestly just going through the usual routine and trying to work quickly for him and no one had ever said anything like that to me at work before Never mind the fact that I had good results in school and was on track to law school I was totally stumped about what to say to him whether to defend myself or just take it Thats when this voice pipes up from over the mans shoulder Its my English teacher and he says Actually this cashier is a student of mine and in the top  of her grade you absolute dick The man looks flabbergasted slaps his money down on the counter and stalks off with his loaf of bread I just looked at my English teacher and he smiled apologised for swearing and kept walking with his coffee EDIT There seems to be some confusion when I say law school In Australia you can go straight from high school to an undergraduate Bachelor of Laws I meant my predicted high school results were high enough to get me into my preferred university for that course And yes the main point of contention for my story has almost nothing to do with my story Classic Reddit p,Actually this cashier is a student of mine and in the top  of her grade you absolute dick,2948
calladus,254,563,1g7s1a,1957,Really I had no ideaI was checking out of the local home supply warehouse and used my store credit card for my purchase  which consisted of a couple of pallets of fencing materialsThe cashier didnt look like she was new  This particular store has everyone wearing orange vests and they are encouraged to decorate them  Hers was starting to look a little shabby but had lots of colored drawings of flowers all over it  Shed been here for a whileAnd she was wooden  She was doing her job quickly and efficiently but I might as well had been invisible  No eye contact no talk no life  Taking my cue from her after my initial hello I stayed quietWhen I pulled out my store credit card she asked me if she could see my ID too  Ive been the victim of identity theft before  My credit cards have my signature and a see ID on the back  Even now I have a fraud alert on my credit  So Im VERY happy when cashiers ask to see my ID and I ALWAYS tell them thank you in a cheerful mannerThank you so much for asking I said as I pulled out my ID Im always so glad when a cashier asks  I know people give you crap for it but it really does mean a lot to me  So thank youAnd she started crying  It wasnt like she was bawling but her eyes teared up and her voice got that tremulous tone we have all experienced at some point in our livesThere werent any other customers so we talked for a few minutes about how terrible customers can be and she regained her composure again  Apparently another customer had read her the riot act for something or another Im not sure what and it had really hurt herIve told her about talesfromretail  maybe we will see her here ,I was a customer and I made the cashier cry,2520

jetblacklungs,215,622,1nm96m,1738,   So this just happened a few days ago I apologize for the wall of text but its warranted for the story   I manage a shipping store that loves the color brown We have  employees and we do the typical packaging and shipping that you would expect along with copies printing etc As an additional source of revenue we have private contracts to do fingerprinting for two different agencies that run background screenings People in certain lines of work in our state medical child care education etc are REQUIRED BY LAW to have these background screenings done before starting a new job and after every  years of employment    People are registered with one of these two agencies make payment to them and are then sent to us with a registration number form to have their fingerprints collected We collect the fingerprints digitally on equipment provided to us by the agencies and they are then electronically submitted to the background check agencies who in turn send them to the FBI and our state law enforcement agency for processing We then sign off on their registration number form and tell them to hold onto it in case there are any problems I should also mention that these screenings are quite expensive to register for but we are only paid a small commission by the agencies for each person we fingerprint We are also the ONLY place in the area to have this done for these agencies    No we do a LOT of fingerprinting here easily  people a day between the two agencies and it can get quite the disruptive to handling of other business in the store when youve only got  people working  We have lots of strict guidelines that we are required to abide by for fingerprinting so before we start we simply give folks a rundown of what we are going to do and what we need them to do to get them finished as quickly as possible Most people cooperate some do not Some are just downright rude about it If someone isnt cooperating with what we need them to do keeping relaxed not trying to roll their fingers themselves etc we will ask them again a few times to cooperate If they are rude about it or still dont cooperate then we just do what we need to do to get them finished and out the door If youre fingerprints are deteriorated or damaged or if you were just uncooperative and didnt allow us to get clear prints the prints can be rejected by the FBI or state law enforcement agency as unreadable If this happens they send you a rejection number and then you have to come back with that and your original registration number and get them done all over again This is where our story begins   I am at the counter helping customers when this woman walks in You know those people who you can just look at and instantly tell that they are going to have a bad attitude This was one of them so well just cal her Bad Attitude BAMe  Hello how are you todayBA  Here thrusts random paper at meMe  take paper see scribbled number on paper Okay lets see what weve got here Ah it looks like you need to be fingerprinted again BA  in extremely condescending tone Uh YEAHMe  Okay do you have your original registration IDBA  SIGH condescending tone NO why dont you just look it upMe  Im sorry but I dont have any way to do that I dont have access to the agencies systems to search for your information We simply enter your registration number to pull up your appointmentBA  whatever I dont care JUST DO ITMe  I wont be able to do anything without your registration numberBA  snatches paper from me THIS IS FCKING RIDICULOUSMe  Okay well that was unnecessary BA  starts stomping outYOU PEOPLE SHOULDVE JUST DONE YOUR FCKING JOBIve had it with this lady at this pointMe  alright then you have a lovely dayBA  YEAH YOU TOO ASSHOLE   At this point she walks out the door Mind you this all happened in front of other customers I apologize to them for her language     One of my associates M begins telling me that he was the one that fingerprinted her originally He tells me that she was very uncooperative and was just as rude when he had dealt with her I then tell M and my other associate D that if she comes back in to let me handle it I plan on refusing her service and asking her not to return to the store     I am just finishing up with a customer when M motions toward the door BA is coming back in and shes talking to someone on the phone She walks up to the counter and thrusts her phone at me I know whats going on here Bad move ladyBA  HERE TALK TO THEM starts muttering about how stupid we areMe  Hello this is Jetblacklungs Im the store managerPhone  Hello this is Derpina Im the HR director for Blabiddy Blah Health Care Center I understand that theres a problem with BAs fingerprinting what information did you needMe  Well we needed to have her registration ID to collect her finger prints again but at this point Im not going to be able to complete this for herPhone  What is the issue   BA is standing directly across the counter from me with a slightly puzzled look on her face I look her dead in the eyes as I continue speakingMe  When she came in earlier and I asked her for the information I needed she became very rude and combative telling me that my request was effing ridiculous and that we shouldve done our effing jobs before calling me an AHole from across the store on her way out This was all done in front of several customers in my store We do not tolerate this kind of behavior and I will not allow her back into this store  A look of horror and plain old oh sht flashes across BAs faceBA  well you started it   I give her a look that just says bitch pleasePhone  Oh my god I am SO sorry I apologize for this I completely understand Please know that we will definitely handle this and she will NOT be back in your store Could you please put BA back on the phone Again I am so sorry for this  BA is standing there mouth agape looking like someone just ran over her puppy I hand her phone back and say She wants to talk to you you can leave my store now  She turns to walk out and puts the phone back to her ear Im listening with delight as she walks outBA  HelloYeah Ibbutwell he starbut I cantno wait pleaseHello HELLO   She glares back at me I just wave and say Bye Havent seen her since      TLDR Horrible lady berates me and calls me an AHoleNO JOB FOR YOU   ,Call me an AHole in front of my customers will you How about I get YOU fired,2360
GingerSpice,177,645,1jrliv,1720,Not sure where else to post this but I really need to get this off my chestI am a gymnastics coach and I generally love my job I work with the upper level girls the ones that go out and compete even though Im considered pretty young college age to be coaching teams Were a pretty small gym and the parents are for the most part great to work with But there is one Ohhhhh there is always that oneThis mom a woman who takes pride in the fact that she is a childrens therapist and basically a glorified tutor is the most Im their friend first and their parent second person I have ever met in my life when it comes to her children She brought her daughter Entitled Mini Witch EMW for short to our program just under  years ago Now EMW is talented but because her mother lets her get away with murder she is one of the most lazy rude and miserable children I have ever had to work with I am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break and I just need to get this out of my system before going back for the teams second work out because Im still lividIm eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork because its easier for me to just stay there rather than drive all the way back home then all the way back to the gym and there are no classes during the afternoon so my boss is fine with it This mother storms into the gym marches straight up to the desk and says Ginger I am absolutely shocked and appalled by what EMW told me today but I know kids can exaggerate so I wanted to come talk to you before going to Owner Awh shoot I know exactly whats coming This girl came to practice  minutes late we were almost done with warm up and she was being generally unpleasant But its twoadays and mornings suck so I was trying to be understanding I got nothing but backsass and I cant do event she doesnt like my ankle hurts Yet when we got to an event she enjoyed she was magically healed I was having none of it But like the good little peon I am I responded with Oh uhm okay What did EMW tell you about practice Mom She said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out All practice She was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to herAlright now Im kind of agitated but I expected this kind of thing This sounds like a typical case of a  year old girl who is blatantly manipulating her mother Regardless I know this family and I know that trying to explain this would go in one ear and out the other so I respond in my most sicklysweet customer service voice Ah well Im sorry EMW was crying after practice but I was trying to keep her as healthy as possible See when she got here late I asked her to warm up on her own while we went to tumbling As soon as she finished she got through two turns before complaining that her ankle hurt I had her sit and ice it for  minutes take the ice off for  then had her come try tumbling again She said it still hurt so I had her do the LegAnkle Injury conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a breakMom Okay but then why didnt you let her do TrampolineUnderstandable question but I was so sick of this girl coming up to me demanding to do trampoline insisting that her ankle felt better and that I was just a horrible mean person that I had had enough of the way she was treating me I explained to the mother that If the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in EMWs ankle so badly that she couldnt tumble adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain I didnt want her to further injure herself so I had her finish the listThis is where it gets insane This is where I legitimately expect to lose my stuffing Her mom decided to inform me EMW was just being dramatic Im sure her ankle wasnt as bad as it seemed she just doesnt like tumbling Im sure you know that She wanted to do trampoline though and I dont understand why you wouldnt let her just because she was pretending to get hurtWhat No seriously what My mind was absolutely blown I was so infuriated I was tempted to kick her out right then and there But alas I kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as I informed this mother Im sorry Mrs last name here at gym name we take athlete health and injuries very seriously I had no way of knowing whether EMWs ankle was barely twisted or about to fall off I had nothing but EMWs word to decide what to do When an athlete says they are in that much pain I cannot in good conscience allow them to further injure themselves If EMW wants to be a part of gymnastics she has to practice gymnastics If she wants to be a part of trampoline there is a name of a business with wall to wall trampolines and a history of a lot of injuries that is pretty popular on the west coast about  minutes awayShe huffed out and said that EMW wasnt feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today I asked that she make sure EMW gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door I called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened She just laughed and said shed take care of it if she got a call Sorry for the wall of text and if there is somewhere better to put this please let me know but I really just needed to get that out thereEDIT I realized some of you might not know what conditioning is Its basically the strength part of gymnastics Pushups situps pullups things like that where you arent actually doing anything completely gymnastics related just focusing on building muscle and enduranceEDIT  Obligatory Holy shit Im on the front page edit But seriously thank you to everyone who upvoted and everyone who commented Yall made my day so much betterIf anyone was wondering second practice went very well and we even played a game at the end of practice One of the girls asked where EMW was and I explained that she was resting her ankle One of my other girls asked You know she was faking right My only response was I know and we moved on Very good very productive practice I love my job,Why wont you let my daughter lie to you,2365
NotACEO,124,648,1odkne,1722,Hey TFR  Ive got a good one for you today and I still get giddy thinking about itI work at a bank and this occurred about four years ago  We had a customer come in slightly upset someone had broken into his car and stolen only a few checks from his checkbook and had immediately gone on a spending spree at nearby grocery stores the kind where they use your check to pull the funds out immediately identical to a debit card  Our manager immediately refunded the lost money and put a Warning on his account telling us not to cash any check numbered from  to  the numbers of the stolen checks He was assured that any more money he lost would be refunded  He didnt want to close the account which is what I would have recommended because it takes a while to get new checks and cards and he didnt want to go through all the troubleNot  days later we have whats called a NonCustomer walk in meaning they dont have an account at that bank but still have transactions to run most often cashing checks  Im currently covering for several coworkers lunches so Im the only Teller covering the lobby  He walks up to me hands me a check and his ID and tells me he wants to cash it  Alright cool let me just check thwhoa wait a minute  This is a check that was stolen from that customer a few days agoI doubled and triple checked my suspicions and I was rewarded with numerous red flags The check number was within the stolen range  to  The signature was clearly forged and was easily the most damning evidence The amount of the check was for an absurdly high amount based on the Babysitting Job description scrawled down in the memo line the check was for We the tellers had been instructed to call the police in the event that anyone ever came in an presented a forged check and also had strong reason to believe that the person in front of us had done the forging  The dude in front of me was covered from head to toe with tattoos smelled like an ashtray dressed in the dirtiest clothes you can imagine and had the words Fuck Off tattooed on his right forearm in very large very easytoread lettersIn other words I was calling bullshit on him cashing a  check based on his babysitting workSo I needed to call the police but how  There was no way this guy would stick around the second I picked up the phone and accused him of stealing a check not to mention the fact that this guy actually looked fairly dangerous  Normal protocol said that I need a manager to verify the check at which point I would go to the back room and call the copsand stay back there leaving the customer at the counter getting frustrated and suspiciousSo I improvised I started angrily hitting the spacebar on my keyboard and muttered loud enough for the thief to hear me Come on not again  When he looked inquiringly at me I scowled and said Sorry my system just froze up  Weve been having trouble with this stupid thing all day  Let me see if I can get someone else to do itI gave a forChristssakejustgowithit look at my only other coworker who fortunately picked up on what I was doing immediately and complained that sure enough her system went down too  I looked back up at the thief and apologized in a halflaugh halfscowl that his wait would be a few minutes because our entire network had just gone down  He totally bought it even going so far as to say something like Damn computers they never work when you need them too hahaha  I agreed and told him Id go back in the back room to get his cash ready if nothing elseI called the police explained the situation to them and they assured me a cop was on his way to our location fast  I hung up and called our corporate office and let THEM know what was happening and they assured me that I was doing the right thing and that they were sending the bank lawyer to our location ASAP and to be safe  I then called our branch manager who was on lunch at this time and then the customer and let them both know what was going on and that wed keep them updatedOnce I was done with this stuffI walked back out to the counter and walked right back up to the thief apologized again for his wait assuring him that we had our IT department working nonstop on the situation and would he like a free soda to compensate for the wait  He like that so I went and got him one   minutes later and I was sweating bullets at this point my body was swimming in adrenaline the cop walked in directly behind the thief who was completely unaware of the whole situation  I made eye contact with the cop nodded and then nodded again towards the thiefLong story short the thief turned around and completely went limp at the sight of cop  He admitted to stealing the checks almost instantly and was promptly placed into handcuffs right there in our lobby  Our bank lawyer who was on the phone with the customer whod had his checks stolen and branch manager walked in a few minutes later after that  After the thief was hauled off I was told I had done well by upper managementThe best part  Saying that our system was down became the companywide goto excuse whenever tellers needed to stall for time in order to call the policeJustiiiiiiiiiiiice,Oh darn Our System is Down or the Tale of the Thief Who Got Served,2370

FredFltStn,278,745,1pm32e,1663,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Welcome to the week of scam artists They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingEverything we sell is Buy  Get  Free BOGO We also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for Buy  Get  Free on any item up to  We also let you mix and match the items so you dont have to get three of the same things Im basically giving you an extra  in free fireworks just for showing up in the hopes that you purchase more than that and that you come back to see us every yearThe coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom Can only be used on one item cannot be reproduced one offer per day one offer per family our group only valid on items up to  etc I usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket and I hand them out pretty freely when the store is open I think its a great promotional tool and although it does impact my bottom line I wouldnt think of getting rid of itAs you can imagine we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the couponSCAM   Theres a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons Each time its the same routine Theyll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell When theyre ready to checkout the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately each carrying their three items and each with and a coupon They each pay for one item and get the other two for free If we ask them if there together which Ive done before for laughs they shake their heads and act like theyve never met even though they just spent the last hour shopping together The very next day theyll show up and do the exact same thing  Another hour of examining products pick out three walk to the counter separately use their coupon Even though they are technically scamming me I always let it go because frankly I think its funny as hellSCAM   Another regular customer Every season this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase When he gets to the counter he presents his coupon and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item Hell then spend  minutes arguing that I let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here In the end Ill let him use it on two items and he celebrates like hes won the lottery The thing is hes a regular and he buys a shitload of fireworks Id probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didnt have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out I seriously think he does it just to feel like hes gotten something over on us SCAM   A lady walks up to the counter with a fountain  and two massive assortments  in her cart I was standing behind the counter so I went to ring her up Before I could start she handed me a coupon and this conversation took placeLADY  Im just paying for the fountain Im going to use the coupon for the free itemsME  wondering WTF she is thinking Im sorry but the coupon is only good on items up to  and the free items have to be of equal or lesser valueLADY  It doesnt say that anywhere on the couponI look at the coupon and sure as hell shes rightbecause shes cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legaleseME  Im sorry but this coupon has been altered It normally has all the details on the bottom handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can seeLADY  Thats not my problem My coupon doesnt say that so legally you have to honor my purchaseME  rudely because WTF really Yeah thats not going to happen I dont know what happened to your coupon sure I dont but its been altered and Im not obligated to take altered couponsThe lady is now full on yelling at me insisting that Im breaking the law and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon On this particular day thank god we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security We do that on our busier days because its a great deterrent for theft and it builds goodwill with the local police since they make great extra money for a really easy gig see herehttpredditnkw Besides they love my moms Cajun cookingThe lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about meBefore she can say anything the officer looks her in the eyes and says One moment maam the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hearOFFICER  Did you want me to arrest her or just throw her

zerohunter,154,436,1ei0r2,1640,Hello again TFR I posted a storyhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentseakwtilostmypurse a couple of days ago from my time working at a deli While some crazy things happened every now and then this is by far the craziest thing that has every happened to me while working there Please bear with me as this will be a little longThis particular day I was working a double shift as a delivery driver It was a couple of hours until my first shift ended and two deliveries got called in One delivery was pretty close to our location and the other was a little farther but still a pretty short driveEasy I think to myself Ill take the farther one and drop of the closer one on the way back I came to find out that Im glad I made that decisionEverything goes relatively smoothly I drop off the first one arrive at the second and knock on the door I immediately hear what sounds like a small child yellingMOOOOOMMM HEEELLLLPPNo biggie I think Some kid was horseplaying and probably fell down Im sure their mom will be here shortly and answer the doorSo I wait And wait And wait some moreI knock again and the screaming picks back up Wait a minute or two the screaming subsides Knock again the screaming picks upMy mind starts to race Surely the mom will be here right Did she fall asleep Is she even thereBy now every time I knock the screaming gets more and more desperate Like someone is in some serious pain I even tried opening the door but it was locked I mull it over in my head a bit and finally decide on what I need to do Ill call  Even if it isnt an emergency at least I can have the peace of mind that it wasnt anything bad As an aside Ive hardly ever called  so I was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to callI call the dispatcher and tell them whats going on I tell them that theres what sounds like a child yelling in this house and they inform me that theres a unit close by whos on the way Within  seconds a police cruiser comes down the road He comes up and I tell him what I told the dispatcher He knocks and hears the screaming Tries to get into the house but no avail so he goes around to the back By this point a second cop shows up And a third The first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door Turns out it was an older lady not a kid like I thought Shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road Fuck This might be pretty bad Even worse was the fact that I parked in the driveway of this house and the ambulance blocked me in forcing me to stay The firemen rush up to the door and bust it down The paramedics rushed in after them along with the cops So now Im outside by myself waiting for them to finish whatever it is theyre doing so I can finally leave and get back to work The entire time Im worried that something is seriously wrong and felt helpless throughout the whole thingFinally the paramedics come out with someone on a stretcher and load them up into the ambulance One of the cops comes up to me and informs me that the lady living in this house recently has hip surgery and while she was walking around the house she somehow displaced her hip leaving her immobile and in a lot of pain He told me it was a good thing I called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck thereHe gives me a congratulatory pat on the back everyone loads up and leaves and I finally make my way back to the deli I get there cash out and go on my much needed breakEpilogue  Later on during the night shift the husband of the woman came in to pick up the food from earlier As my coworker was helping him she pointed me out as the one who called Youre the one who did that  Yes sir I was really worried that something serious happenedHe beams at me shakes my hand while thanking me profusely and hands me a few bucks for the trouble In all honesty he didnt even have to tip me Just his face and reaction was a good enough tip for me , what is your emergency Uh yeah so Im at a customers house,2076
FredFltStn,302,753,1pgoim,1627,BACKGROUND  I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heavenSTORY  Welcome to the week of scam artists They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingOne of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down She noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong and wanted to let me know so we could fix it We occasionally screw up once again Im talking about you Josh and misprice stuff When we do we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault Well then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelfThe item was a large mortar kit that retails for  buy  get  free The price tag on it said  so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our screwup I walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products but they all seem to be ok so I went back to helping other customersA minute later I get flagged down again for another price check Its another large item and its priced for less than half of what it normally sells for I make a mental note to castrate Josh then go to check out the remaining items Once again they all seem to be priced correctly but I did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag I grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a stickerI barely finished putting a sticker on the item when Im flagged down AGAIN Now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are She really starts to raise hell so I apologize and tell her that well take care of the issue I also remind her that even though the items were mispriced we were giving them to her at the lower priceI go to check the item on the shelf and once again all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right Now my spider sense is tingling I walked back to the counter to help the cashier ring in the rest of the itemsAmazingly I noticed that at ALL of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced All of her large items no matter what the original price now have a price tag of  I stopped the transaction looked the lady in the eye and told her Im not selling you anything and you need to leave nowDo you remember the scene from the movie The Exorcist where Father Merrin Max von Sydow tries to expel the demon from Reagan Linda Blair The scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that but with less head spinning and more swearingIm in my s and I honestly believe that I learned a few new words that day She combined swear words and ethnic slurs that Im fairly certain have never been used together before She wove an amazing tapestry of obscenity punctuated occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger I think she could have honestly set some type of world record but I apparently threw off her rhythm when I started applauding her performanceI offered to call the police and have them sort it out but she was apparently uninterested and made a beeline for the door The sad thing was she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items In retrospect I really need to train my staff better My cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items but when I started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity none of my staff joined in Ill be adding that to our Standard Operating Procedures SOP before the upcoming New Years EveIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,She would have gotten away with it if she wasnt so greedy Tales From a Fireworks Tent,2380

Personsen,445,652,1qvk5o,1614,lyranotsureIm not a huge fan of coupons in general There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired they dont scan or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up which is a pet peeve of mine If you want to use one or two coupons I am fine with that I completely understand wanting to save some moneyBut there is a trend that pisses me off to no end  Couponers  A lady came in a while back with a large amount of deodorant in her basket After I finished ringing her up she said  Oh and I have a few coupons  She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse  None of them having scannable bar codes meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to  She notices I am reading them and says Yeah Those should pay for the entire transaction  Im sorry it says limit one coupon per customer and that they arent to be used with any other coupons I reply  No I did the math I have enough here to cover the entire transaction In fact you guys should technically be giving me cash back she says with a chuckle  At this point the line was piling up again on my register so I called up a third cashier and the manager  The manager comes up and asks how he can help  She says Yeah this guy wont let me use my coupons  I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons cant be used like this  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for freeBefore she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her She says You should be expecting more of us  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here Next time just scan the damn coupons She then struts out the door with a smile  The manager was fired soon after  ,Fuck Couponers,2266
RedHeadedBug,66,376,1l698q,1615,This happened a while ago but has really stuck with me and I like to think about it on really bad days at workI had been working all day in the aquatics department of my store dealing with all manner of rude condescending customers when this little boy maybe  or  years old and a woman whom I had assumed was his mother came inThey were looking to buy some fish for the tank that the little boy had gotten for his birthday He came right on up to me grabbed my hand and asked me very politely if I could find him some fish that would be happy to come live with me My heart just about melted I told him that I most certainly could and asked him if he could ask his mom who was a little ways off looking at the betta fish what size his tank was so we could get started He replied She isnt my mommy she is my all pearsThe woman over heard this and saw my obviously confused face and explained that she was his nanny and that his parents called her an Au Pair once and he had liked the way it sounded but apparently couldnt pronounce it correctly I helped them find some fish for his  gallon tank some mollies and a couple of swordtails and when I had finished bagging them up and handed them off to the all pears the little boy gave a little tug on my apron and thanked me for helping them He also asked if he could give me a hug and take a picture with me and his new fish So I knelt down to his level and let him throw an arm around me while his other hand held the bag of fish and the nanny took our picture  It was just the sweetest thing I have ever had happen to me at workThe nanny came in about a week later when I was working to get more food for the fish and told me that the little boy had asked her to print the picture out and that now it sits on his desk right next to his tank where the fish can see it so that they dont miss their old house and their old friendsIt makes me smile ever time I think about that little boy and his nanny even though I havent seen them since that last time the nanny came in He was so sweet and polite and just really made my day that day ,The little boy and his All Pears,1991
pompous,211,448,1p6euj,1597,Closer to the end of my shift today a family came into the store It was a mom dad and two daughters probably around  and  They browsed for a bit and every once in a while I would listen in The mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer When they picked out the items they wanted to buy two Disney Infinity characters and a game and my coworker told them their total the mom turned to the oldest daughterYoure paying for these with your birthday money Do you remember how much money you have When the daughter shook her head the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter letting the daughter add up the  dollar bills When the girl had decided she had  my coworker reminded her that she owed  The mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys The daughter replied yes really hesitantly and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer So the daughter handed the money to my coworker who rang up the transaction gave her the change and helped her count it out The daughter thanked us and began to leave carrying the bag but the mom stayed behind to thank us She was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value and at other places cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enoughIt may seem very insignificant but examples of good parenting coming into my store are few and far between and I thought Id share with you all,Best parent that Ive seen in a long time,2045

receiptOkay your total is  She looks at me flabbergasted for a secondNo its not The guy told me that it was  Ill double check the math I added everything up again and said No Im sorry This is  see No youre wrong Why would he tell me that it was  He must have been giving me a discount He might have misspoke or miscalculated but he wrote right here on your ticket Well you need to get him on the phone then I need to talk to your managerIm sorry that man is not the manager My manager doesnt actually work at the store Im in charge for the dayWell Im going to need his number She was huffing and puffing at this point and I was also getting shakey My boss had given me a no nonsense policy and tells me to ask customers to leave and not come back when they get indignant She also doesnt want me calling her for any reason Shes not a very good managerIm sorry to be honest with you I dont know the other employees number and I cant give you my managers cell phone numberWELL THEN CALL HER Get her on the phone right nowIm sorry I cant call her in the middle of the day Shes at work right now Im the manager right now This argument repeats until she gets the pictureIm not paying anymore than what that man told me  is all you can haveThats fine if you just want to pick up a few things We can hold on the the rest until you can pay for themAre you fucking kidding me Youre going to be stealing my clothes from me I can take them if I want toWell weve already provided you a service Im not going to give them back until you pay for them Protip using big words like this piss people off In retrospect I was being condescendingAt this point she goes over to her clothes and starts tearing them out of the bags Shes throwing the bags all over the floor huffing and mumbling and tearing her clothes off the hangersThese look like shit Im not paying for theseIm sorry Id be happy to redo them for you It would be ready to pick up in two daysFuck I NEED them this weekend No you cant redo them But Im not paying full priceIm sorry the total is still  I was not giving inWho THE FUCK do you think you are she screamed I then make the worst mistake of my life I chuckle Not to be condescending but because I am really uncomfortable I mean really uncomfortable even after five years in retail I am in awe every time some yells at me like this I am a humanist and am still constantly in shock that people can be so aggressive and hateful Im naive whatever Anyway I chuckle a nervous isladygoingtokillme laugh She loses itTHIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE IM NOT FUCKING PLAYING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW MY HUSBAND IS GOING TO KILL ME WHEN I GET HOME IF I SPEND  FUCKING DOLLARS ON THESE CLOTHES DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT HES ALREADY PISSED OFF WITH ME AND HES PISSED OFF WITH YOU FOR TAKING SO FUCKING LONG TO

get some work done while we wait for the police I picked up all the trash and hangers she threw all over the floor In retrospect I should have left them as evidence she was being crazy I guess she might have said I threw it at her The police station is right up the road so it wasnt a long wait Oh she called in late for work while she watched me pick up her mess The officer came in and he was super polite and calm She recounted her story which was mostly true if a little biased Me not giving her a discount me not calling the manager She also added that I owed her for the money she was missing by not being at work in time She did say that I told her she had to leave after she called  because I was trying to hide the evidence lolwhut I then said that wasnt true that she called the police after I asked her to leave The officer looked a little confused and asked me what happened He turned back to the lady and said Okay What can Thiscity Police Department do for you todayShe said Well officer if Im not happy with the service I need a discountHe turned to the lady and said You know I dont want to discourage you from calling  when you need to You should call if youre in danger Or in the case of criminal activity but this is a dispute that the police department cant settle for you Why dont you come back on another day to pick up your clothesYes sir officer thats a good idea I agree he said Im going to need you to step outside with me so that I can get your information Just in case you need me againAnd she left He took her info outside and she got in her car and presumably drove to work She came back the next day and payed  for her dry cleaning I felt really bad for her   ,Lady calls  because I wont give her a discount NSFW language,2145
FatHead,297,494,1h5yw0,1564,So I was working at a popular video game store a couple years back when Fifa  was just being released It was a high volume store so we got plenty of copies This also meant we had a huge amount of preordersPeople would often preorder the game specifically to get the included collectors items and we had one customer well call him Fred that called up the day before and preordered the collectors edition for his sons th birthday It was one of the last ones we had in stock so he was lucky to snag it in timeFast forward to release day and it was crazy busy For the first time since Id worked there we actually sold every one of our preorders on release day as well as all of our regular stockExcept for one  Freds copySo the day chugged along busily and as it drew to a close we only had one copy left which was reserved for Fred I was constantly turning people down for sales of the game or signing them up for a copy when a new shipment arrivedI then left the register to do some inventory for  minutes before returning In just  minutes my genius colleague managed to sell Freds copy of Fifa I didnt know this had happened so about  minutes after Id returned to the register Fred and his wife walks in and asks to pick up his sons copy of the game I do a search for the game and our stock says a big fat ZERO This includes reserved stockMe Im sorry sir we just sold the last copy There must have been a mixup and your reserved copy was sold to another customerFred What But I reserved it Its for my sons th birthday tonightMe I apologize its entirely our fault We dont have any copies to sell you today but I can put you on a waiting list for the next shipment that comes to the store if youd likeIts at this point I notice Freds wife is crying I notice that Fred is visibly trying to control his anger but his face is going red and I can see that the situation is not getting any betterFred My sons birthday is tonight and I promised him wed play the new Fifa tonight What am I going to do THIS IS UNFAIRI feel very sorry for these people and I realize that this is a very unfair situation for them so I improviseMe Im really sorry sir Let me do a quick search for other stores in the area that have stock and heres a  off voucher for the game I hope that makes up for our mistakeAs I was talking I found a store about  minutes away that had stock of the game As I handed the voucher to Fred his entire composure changed completely He was dumbfounded and a massive smiled exploded onto his faceFred Oh wow thank you so much Ill go there right now and pick the game up Thank you Ill definitely come back to this store from now on And his wife thanked me profusely as well I felt great Id made a familys day kept a customer happy and probably saved the store a lot of bad wordofmouth Those are the moments that make retail worthwhileAs I was closing up that night the store manager came up and started talking to meStore manager fathead I saw what you did with those customers today You do realise thats a serious breach of store policy Thats  off the other stores margin Those vouchers are supposed to be for the ltother gamegt promotion only Im going to speak to the Area Manager about this and I never want to see you do that again without my permissionI was speechless I could not believe a manager could be so moneyhungry that hed prefer to absolutely piss a customer off because of my colleagues mistake over giving them a voucher and making them happy as anything I was furious that night because even though it was apparently against store policy I didnt deserve to be told offNext day I come in for my shift and the Area Manager is talking to the store manager I get pulled into the back roomArea Manager fathead Store Manager has filled me in on what you did yesterday with the  coupon Unfortunately that is a serious breach of store policy and were going to have to terminate your employment Please give me your store key and leave immediatelyI was actually not really that surprised I was only a casual and so they could fire me on a whim and the area manager was equally as pennypinching as the store managerMe You know what dont bother firing me I dont want to work here if youre going to treat me like this I tried my best to keep the customer happy but hey dont let me stop you from pissing off the people who pay your wage Did Store Manager tell you it was ltemployeegts fault their RESERVED game was sold to someone else I guess thats perfect grounds for firing the employee that fixed the situation Now theres some good managementThen I dropped my store key on the ground and walked out without another word Maybe that was a bit too rude but I just couldnt believe that theyd value  over customer service Just another example of managers power tripping and pennypinching without caring for the people they are there to service Oh well Im glad they fired me It was a terrible place to workTLDR I rant for ages about getting fired for fixing our stores mistake,Im sorry sir we just sold the last copy of the game you preordered yesterday,2058

CurvedStraightLine,79,391,1l4bv8,1523,Quick story I just told a friend and figured Id commit to the ages hereAfter I left the store I have spoken at length about I was working for a chain of craft supply stores  I was hired on as a manager but they didnt actually have a store to put me in  So I was serving as acting store manager in multiple locations  Basically if you were the store manager and went on vacationwere in the hospital or if a manager had been fired or quit and they were moving in the new store manager they would just have me fill in at the store until things settledI did this for eight months travelling over eight states living out of hotel rooms which wasnt actually what I signed on for but thats another storySo I am in New York covering a store and in walks a guy with a return  All returns in this company were handled by a manager and we had final discretionIn this case the guy was obviously pulling some scam  The product was used and had old packaging but he had a new receipt  Plus he had an out of state license  He claimed that he was on vacation but who takes along a receipt to make a return from two months ago while on vacationHe huffed and puffed when I told him no and threatened to go to another locationThat night I got a call from my DM  A manager had been fired and they were relocating me NOW  I drove overnight to Virginia edit realizing that not everyone knows distance here  I drove for  hours that night non stop save for bathroom breaks  Its REALLY far away I met my DM at the store to get the keys and story and stuck around a little while before crashing at the hotelHalfway through the day I get paged that a customer has a return  I come up and its the same guy  I let him talk about his return show me his receipt then I smile and say Just like I told you in New York you cant do this returnHe stared at me for a moment  Im a redhead so he slowly recognized me eyes going wide and he backed away  He glanced over at the doorway I had come from confused  Then he just left leaving his receipt behindThe other store wasnt his local store where the receipt was from either although closer to home so he had just apparently tried to pull the same scam elsewhere only to meet OmniManager,OmniManager,1914
hostile,191,261,198a3j,1492,Ive been working in a groceryclothinggeneral merchandise retailer for about four years  Mostly I work up at the customer service desk which entails printing up money orders processing wire transfers selling all the tobacco products cashing out lottery and primarily returns and exchanges  A year or so ago during a slower part of the day a man probably in his midlate s comes up to me at the desk with an xbox  to return  He said that he bought it a couple weeks prior which was true as he had his receipt still and I checked the date for his son who decided that he wanted a PS instead  He said that they already purchased a PS somewhere else and he just needed to return the xboxUnfortunately even with a receipt gaming consoles in addition to all computer software and hardware CDs DVDs video games etc are nonrefundable once theyve been opened  Ive always thought that this policy was completely reasonable especially since my store only deals in brand new products not used  And we cant ship it back to the manufacturer unless there is some kind of manufacturers defect which in this case there was notI calmly explained to him that once a console has been opened we can do nothing but exchange it for an identical product and thats only in the case of a defect  He scowls at me and demands a manager  Fine AWESOME  I can see where this is going and I dont get paid enough to deal with the brewing storm of attitude  So I call up the electronics manager and he comes over to talk to the customerThe customer explains that he doesnt want the xbox anymore and wants his money back  In return the electronics manager disclosed our return policy basically verbatim for what I said He demands a different manager this time much MUCH louder  Wow okay  So I give my direct manager a call and ask her to come over  She comes over gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back and how were stealing from him by not giving him a refund  She asks the electronics manager who is still standing up here what our policy is he informs her she looks at the customer and says something like sorry this is our policy  If theres anything else we can do for you please just ask hostile The man explodes  Yelling and screaming about how he doesnt want this fucking thing and its ours and we have to take it back  There was some more screaming about how were dirty thieves and were stealing money from him and how its illegal  Lots of yellingI called the store director  The bosss bosss boss  HE gets paid enough to deal with this bullshitThe director who is actually a completely rational cool dude comes up and after patiently listening to this guys ranting for about  minutes gives him the same answer that hes gotten from the rest of us Dont you love it when your managers back you up after youve said no to an asshole customer This is the last straw for unhappy customer guy  He claims that if we arent going to do something for him hes calling the police to arrest us all for theft Yep Theft Im stoked to see if he does and apparently the managers are too so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants toDude picks up his cellphone calls his lawyer or at least claims to and leaves a message detailing the situation  Apparently his lawyer didnt have time in the middle of a work day to answer a call from one of her clients  He makes a second call to the  oclock news  He wants EVERYONE to know how shitty undisclosed retailer treats their customers and screams at us about how well all be out of jobs and that no one will ever shop here again  Its a nationwide chain bro  Im pretty sure were going to be fine but thanksHe makes a final call to the police  They were the only ones to answer the fucking phone  Hah  He says that the customer service bitch from retailer has stolen hundreds of dollars from him and is being backed up by all her dumbass managers  Hes screaming at the cops over the phone Im almost surprised that the police didnt hang up on him but I mean they are the cops  I dont think they can legally hang up on anyone whos dialed It takes the cops about  minutes to show up during which time my managers have gone back to their jobs and Im filing away some paperwork and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk having some kind of sit it or something  Every time another customer starts heading my way he yells and screams at them dont shop here  They steal your money  Bunch of fucking thieves  Im fine with this  Its hilarious he looks like a bridge troll and I have paperwork to catch up onEventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face  It wont lastHe declares to the nice officers that I took his money and refused to give it back which obviously puzzles them as Im a fucking employee and covered by like five cameras at all times  I clarify that I didnt take anything from him  He bought an xbox a couple weeks back opened it up and played it then wanted to return it  I also explained our return policy to them  I showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk by the desk that the xbox was purched at on our website and on HIS receipt  I can tell that the poor cops are just dreading dealing with this guy but they give him an ultimatumHe can eitherNot get a refund from us and go homeNot get a refund and go to jailAngry customer ID RATHER GO TO JAIL THEN LET THESE FUCKERS WIN  IM NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY MONEYI dont think he was getting it  So the cops handcuff him and start heading towards the door when I realize that his xbox is still sitting on the counter  I grab it and run after themMe Wait sir  You left your merchendise at the counterOne of the cops takes it from meMe Have a wonderful day sir  Thank you for shopping at retailerIm pretty sure he would have strangled me if he hadnt been handcuffed HahaTLDR Dumbass customer calls the cops on himself and its ever so sweet,Customer calls the cops on HIMSELF,1753

toxicpretty,121,318,1a4yhv,1376,Ok so my latest tale was well received httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsavgjgaveabitchycoworkeralessoninkarmawhile and so I thought I might share my favorite moment in the long and multifaceted job history that is mine And it stars a decently famous person to bootWhen I was ten I had the fortunate experience to begin work at a semi well known theater in Waterford CT where many a star and playwright began their careers This is a place that holds a coveted playwrights conference each year during the summer where many promising writers compete to have their best work fine tuned into  masterpieces The pieces are given to promising young actors who work the plays each night script in hand rife with changes in front of live audiencesbare props simple setsjust the work Each morning mentor directors and scriptwriters work with the playwright to interpret audience reactions and tweak the scripts till they shine Its a fun spontaneous place to work Fortunately my mother worked in the small print shop and after a few weeks of hanging around the theaters I was give a job as an usher It was an unpaid gig but it guaranteed entry and killer seats to any and all the plays during the seasonand as a kid who loved theater it was better than money I worked there from the age of ten till I graduated high school and loved every minute I have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the restTwo summers in there came a time when our awesome stage manager had to quit for another gig Being the most senior of the present ushers and mature for my age the managers  of the theater asked if I would step in for a night or two while they filled the positiontwo days become a week and a week became a month and I was doing a really good job But my hopes of keeping the gig were dashed when they filled the position with the mother of all insecure powerheady bitches She hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her joband she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible Often after saving myself a seat with my jacket I would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance Her excuse Only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status Soon I could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if I stealthily did it when she wasnt looking The hate was becoming seriously mutual and I had begun to think of quittingBut I had to wait till the end of the month because I wanted to see one play in particulara musical version of Fahrenheit  Besides being one of my favorite books I had been watching the rehearsals for weeks and the score was amazing It had two of my friends in it and it was rumored that the playwright had even invited Ray Bradbury to come to opening nightand he had accepted I wasnt going to miss it for anything That night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for CT It was pouring and the wind was fierce I had been extra careful reserving a seat for myselfor at least I thought I had And it was a half hour from curtain Suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded I go to the mansion to tell Mr Bradburys agent that  it was time to get seatedNow let me explain the mansion This theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in Waterford It had several amphitheaters and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonights performance was About a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that housed the theater offices lounges and the cafeteria She essentially wanted me to run a quarter of a mile in the pouring rain to ask a guest to come downdespite the fact that there were phones When I tried to argue she threatened my position I was pissed but I began to run I show up breathless at the lounge in the mansion to see a piggish man finishing the vestiges of a huge meal He hardly acknowledges me when I speak to him and then tells me that Im dismissed By this point Im getting way too pissed to even speak so I run back to the barn sopping wet Its almost curtain time and as soon as I hit the barn I scan for my jacket and my seatonly to find them moved to the back railing Its now standing room only which we allowed with our informal nature and Im done Completely I look around and see my manager speaking to a grey haired gentleman in the front row I quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention I tell my manager that Ive done what shes asked and Im going home She actually smirks and walks away Turning around to leave the gentleman saysArent you staying for the play Its supposed to be wonderful I sigh and without thinking I tell him that Ive just had the worst night ever lost my seat to an ungrateful boss gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion and that even though I was looking forward to itwell its obvious that its time to go home He suddenly says Im so sorry My agent really is a self righteous ass isnt he Thats when I realize who Im talking toMr Bradburyhimself Between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics Id seen of him I hadnt even recognized him I begin to apologize profusely for being so candid but he wont hear any of itinstead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come overMr Bradbury suddenly all business  This young lady is sitting with me this eveningI will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle Bitchy manager But sir she cant sit hereit breaks fire codes and besides Shes an uusherMr Bradbury I dont give a crap about fire codesshes sitting here or Im not staying Now get her a towel and a chairShe looks at me I look at her I smile a smile three miles wide She sighs and slinks off She ever so humbly returns with the requested items but this time cant make eye contact I beamMr Bradbury gesturing to a seat dead front and center My lady shall we enjoy the show I didnt walkI floatedAnd that my friends is how I got to spend an evening watching the coolest musical ever sitting right next to Mr Ray Bradbury discussing with him the finer points of the musical during intermission and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be After that night my manager basically gave up being rude to me She didnt last long after that and I went on to spend many a wonderful summers there,An evening of bringing humble pie to a bitchy manager care of Mr Ray Bradbury himself ,1694

FredFltStn,170,534,1pdzxx,1349,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square foot of fireworks heavenSTORY  I think this week Im going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingWe had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around  and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks My dad greeted them and offered to show them aroundDad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out The entire time these two were trying to work a better deal I know most people dont try to haggle when shopping at their local Target store but hey I get it its a fireworks tent and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit especially if youre picking up a lot of stuff These guys definitely took it to the next levelMy dad is one of the nicest people youll ever meet but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast especially when someone is obviously going over the top Its one thing to offer a lower amount for an item but when you start criticizing the products or my store my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping youAfter about  minutes of this I could see dad was pretty much over these guys so I walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff we would just give them  off their total order They immediately protested that that wasnt good enough but I was pretty firm I already know that Im cheaper than anyone else and  is a substantial discount Hell the only reason I did  is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and I wanted to get them out of the storeThe guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out They fill out the liability waiver and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff After the cashier rings in their purchase she waves me down and I walked over to the counter to see what the issue wasTweedle Dum and Tweedle Dumber TD were trying to pay with two  gift certificates Now I give away a LOT of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions The thing is I only give away  gift certificates These two idiots have obviously photocopied and altered a real gift certificate and are trying to pass it offNow Im pissedME  This is the worst forgery Ive ever seen You guys are idiotsTD  I won those on the radio Theyre realME  My gift certificates are printed on custom paper and I only issue  Gift Certificates These are colored scans of a gift certificate and theyre not realTD  Yes they areTD  Besides if youre gift certificates dont say no reproductions on them you can make copiesME  Yeah thats not what the law says What the law DOES say is that youre guilty of rd Degree Felony Theft for trying to steal  of fireworks their amount before the  discountTD  We didnt try to steal anythingME  You attempted to pay with a forged document Its the same as if you used a stolen credit card I have your name address and multiple witnesses and I fully intent to press charges You guys can stay until the cops arrive or they can arrest you at home doesnt matter to meTD  Thats not real We didnt steal anythingME  Oh because the last two times this has happened at my store never actually happened before the people were arrested and convicted of theft I guess well let the police sort it out If you cant pay for the fireworks its theftTD and TD start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other After a while they insist that Im wrong but theyre willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it Theyre trying to figure out how to split up the  when I informed them that the total was  Theres no way in hell I was giving them a  discount after they tried to scam meIn the end they only paid for and received around  of fireworks and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that We were very careful with the signatures and I made the cashier copy down their drivers license numbers just in case they tried to dispute the charges To be honest I would have just let them leave if they had tried Its not really worth my time or effort to press it and I was actually just making it up as I went along because they pissed me offThey definitely didnt leave happy My dad couldnt resist when they were walking outDAD  You dumbasses come back and see us again next yearThey havent been backIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Scam me and Ill scam you back Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1883
phideauxjr,320,439,1ijxes,1351,Yesterday before my shift I noticed it was pretty dead so I approached the register and made idle smalltalk with my coworker She was pretty much done cleaning up my station and we were just talking about how gross the pastries in our display start looking caloriesugar content wise after youve worked there for a whileSo were talking for a few minutes Not long at all before an older woman who had been seated at the bar by our espresso just staring at us started almost screaming out EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME HEY My coworker who well call Sunny turned and walked over to her and asked her How can I help you today The woman stared at her for a few moments before saying Are you done talking and ready to take my order Id really hate to inconvenience you Sunny handled it pretty well and explained to the lady that to make a togo order she would need to approach the register and that we dont take those orders from seated customers especially customers who already have bagged up food from whatever they ate dining in Which the lady did have several togo boxes already with herThe lady made a huge deal of getting up and walking over to the register I decided to clock in while she waddled over to us While I was punching in my number and tying my apron she just stood at the register I was at and stared at me I directed her to the open register and she just stayed where she was I then explained that I wasnt on the clock and Sunny will be more than happy to help her She rolled her eyes and barked out Mushroom soup I rolled my eyes and asked Medium or large LargeSunny went to the back to make it and I clocked in and rung it up for her The lady kind of wandered over to our display and looked at it for a while She came back to my register I was standing at the open register this time and just stood there I was still in a pretty decent mood despite how short and abnormally rude she was being So I remained casual and waited for her order She finally says You need to take your hand out of your pocketThis is a terrible habit of mine I always keep my left hand in my pocket and ring people up with my right Now because I dont handle food without gloves on no one ever says anything about it But I had the strong feeling that this wasnt really a big deal to her At this point something I did or said when I walked in the door made her hate me I dont know what it was but it was somethingI took my hand out of my pocket and raised my eyebrows in a kay lets get this show on the road so you can gtfo kind of manner and she proceeded to say I want one creme bruleeWe have three different kinds of creme brulee I asked if she wanted the one with sprinkles berries or vanilla She just rolled her eyes and said The creme brulee Duh So I just gave her whatever was in the back of the throw out in an hour slightly smashed up against a metal rail in the cooler creme brulee and packaged her soup before ringing her up She placed her money directly on the counter in front of my register where I couldnt reach it So I had to come around to the front and pick it up and take it back to my till where I finished the transaction and put the money back on the counter and slid it over to herShe took it pocketed it and grabbed her bag Then she said Can I have your name Out of curiosity I just had to ask Why What have I done wrong besides put my hand in my pocketShe then looked at me with this look of pure hatred that I cant explain and said This isnt your goddamn social hour You come here to work Not talk about how gross your food is not to flaunt off how skinny you are and not to show off your political views This Is Work Remember that when corporate fires you and you have to find a job at some other restaurantI was shocked Sure my coworker and I discussed the calorie count in our desserts But my political views So being bold again I asked Im sorry I understand that I did in fact make comments about the calorie count in our desserts And Im truly sorry if it offended you Though Im just curious as to when I stated my political viewsShe then said I saw that NRA sticker on the back of your truck when you pulled in You represent this company and now Im never eating here again In fact youre pretty mouthy Go get your managerThe NRA sticker on the back of my husbands truck But fine whatever I got my manager who explained to her that a tiny almost invisible round sticker with the letters NRA on it was not grounds to get me fired Neither was discussing the calories in an item And that her behavior was inappropriate and turning into harassment and that he would appreciate it if she leftThe rest of the night was fine But damn I think she just didnt like me,Take your hand out of your pocket gt,1790

ObliquiOfTheEcliptic,76,382,1o0ire,1295,So I work in the dairy aisle in a supermarket Its a good job usually and like any supermarket job there are people that will come up and ask if you have a product In this case we would tell them where it is and then just continue with our day But sometimes people know where a product is and they just want to be a dick to the the staff which Im sure you all know aboutCase in point Idiotman walks up to me asking about bread Now for this to make sense you need to understand a few things The supermarket I work at is a regular suburban supermarket near a small arcade area Now in this arcade area there are a couple of shops a hairdressers a patisserie and a Bakery If you want to go to the bakery you have to walk out of the store and then work literally ten meters to your left where the bakery is Anyway Idiotman walks up to me and says Hey you come hear in that rude voice which means something has happened to him that is inexplicably my fault I walk over to him and he is pointing at the shelved area where all the new bread rolls we get everyday are kept Idiotman is giving me dagger eyes and he starts shouting whilst pointing at an empty shelf of  cent rolls I come here everyday and youre always out of these fucking rolls along with other complaints including how he works such a hard schedule and he deserves a roll which fate has somehow unfairly cheated him out ofNow I am a bit flabbergasted at this man There is nothing I can do to get him more bread rolls because they are only delivered once a day but more importantly there is a bakery right next door where he could probably get a cheaper and tastier bread roll My go to response is the usual Sir Im sorry I cant help you but I can get you the manager if you would like But alas Idiotman is a veteran in the field of being a dick to staff and obviously understands that if someone with authority tells him leave there is not much he can do about itHe tells me that I have to deal with the situation for some ungodly reason but I dont want to be rude plus it is apparently my moral duty now to ensure this man gets his bread So I say politely Sir there is not a lot I can do about the situation have you considered going to the bakery next door Unfortunately for me idiot man is offended by common sense and so now he wants me to get the manager so he can tell him How inappropriate it is to tell a customer to shop elsewhere Which according to Idiotman is what I was doing So I go get my manager who is awesome and tell him that some man wants a bread roll which we are out of and is angry because I told him to go to the bakeryMy manager comes back to the man with me and asks what the problem is Idiotman tells my manager You are out of these fucking bread rolls and your staff member has been very rude to me My genius boss looks at him wide eyed and out of nowhere sprints to the front of the store Idiotman and I follow and as we reach the entrance we see my manager standing in the doorway looking at the bakery For about a minute he stands in the doorway staring at the bakery and then looking back at the man back and forth and back and forth with utter confusion on his face Eventually he turns to Idiotman and asks Sir you know there is a bakery right next door rightI only kept it together long enough for the man to drop his basket and storm angrily out before losing my shit EDIT Thanks everyone Im definitely going to show all your comments to my boss next time Im at work,My boss saves me from an idiot who wants bread,1677
Foxfyre,376,424,1mycuz,1285,Hello TFR  Been wanting to post a story here for a while but I couldnt decide on one This one comes to you from  years ago  Our tale starts in a big blue box department store in a small town I was fresh out of high school and working there back when they actually gave full time jobs I was a Jack of all trades pretty much Cashier stock service desk cart pusher On this day I was outside pushing carts It seemed like any other day and pretty soon it was lunch time  I head back to the break room and grab my lunch I would later wish Id headed out to eat that day Luckily I had time to finish eating and by now am just relaxing and chatting with coworkers The phone in the break room rings and someone answers it They holler at me and tell me I have a call  The person on the other end is a girl from the service desk telling me an officer wanted to speak with me What Really  I crack up laughing Ive never had a problem with the lawis this a prank  Next thing I know  I hear this loud male voice in my ear  Sir this is Officer Im a Prick and I Know It  and I need you up front NOW  Well drat  WTF is going on So i trudge the long way through the huge store back up front and find the officer He proceeds to ask me if I saw a purse while I was outside cart pushing Nope  sure didnt officer He of course  doesnt believe me Well a lady lost her purse and says she saw you outside pushing carts at the time   Thats great officer  She probably saw me as I was heading back in for lunch so I wouldnt have wound up pushing her cart Did you drive to work he asks me Yup Sure did  So he has me show him to my car Asks if he can look inside Ive got nothing to hide so I let him He opens all the car doors pops the hood and the trunk looking for this ladies purse During the process of searching my car he found a check my grandma wrote to my girlfriend for her birthday and took it He also found an old ID that a friend had left in my car that I never knew was there and gave me hell for having some elses ID Quizzed me heavily about the check Told him it was a check from my grandmother to my girlfriend and she rode into work with me so she left it in the car Oh  shes here too  Sowe go walking back into the store where he has me point her out so he can give her the check back She glares at him and hands it right back to me He then grabs it from my hand and gives it back to her and tells her not to give it to me again She gives him the evil eye and says hes the one with the bank account  hes going to be cashing it for me and as soon as you leave he is going to be the one holding it again With that she walked away The cop looked pretty mad He starts quizzing me if I have a locker in the back Nope I dont They only give lockers to girls Then he tries to coerce a confession out of me  Not happening bud I didnt do Shit Finally he leaves At this point its been over  hours hed kept me from working and I was still off the clock from lunch I went and raised hell with the managers but all they did was tell me Id be paid for the lost time and that was about it So there we have it The story of how I had to be guilty because in very busy shopping center I was the only minimum wage peon in the area so it had to be my fault  EDIT  Thanks to everyone whos reminded me what my rights are when dealing with a cop  Rest assured I am well aware of them  However as I mentioned at the beginning of this story this was  years ago I was a punk teenager who had never been in trouble with the law and honestly I had no clue and was completely freaked out that it was even being insinuated I was guilty of a crime,Yes officer I was the only minimum wage peon in the area so it has to be my fault,1709

DeaditeQueen,203,415,1llp4h,1244,When I had just turned  I was working as a cashier at a now defunct grocery chain The money and hours sucked but I was at that point in life where I needed to make some money while deciding what the hell to do with my lifeOur store had an employee policy that basically stated that if you went on break and bought something to eat there you could ring yourself up for it after you were off break Essentially if you grabbed some hot wings and a soda you didnt have to pay until you came back Simple My period was late I was nauseous etc All day at work I was sweaty and nervous hoping to GOD I wasnt pregnant there had been a condom breakage I wasnt simply irresponsible My break came and I worked up the nerve I knew we had pregnancy tests on sale and I went and grabbed one While in the aisle I noticed our LP guy doing his rounds and thought nothing of it I took my test to the bathroom with the intent of discretely ringing it up as soon as I was off break and getting rid of the box It was only  and due to a lucky scratch off ticket from the day before I had  in my purse relevantI follow the instructions and BOOM Im preggers I was in disbelief panicked and sweating profusely My head was spinning I put the box in the pocket of my apron pull myself together for the last few hours of my shift and begin trying to figure out how I was going to tell my mother As Im walking down one of the aisles towards the registers the LP guy swept up behind me grabbed the back of my arm quite forcefully and without a word dragged me to the back offices I kept asking what the hell was going on but he wouldnt speak He placed me in his office left and locked the door What the fuck was going onA few minutes later he returned with the manager and my piss soaked stick test in his gloved hand He began to accuse me of stealing I quickly retorted that he had grabbed me on my way to my register and just like everything else an employee grabs when on break I was going to pay for it once I was back on my registerMy manager seemed confused and unsure of the LP guys accusation and asked if I actually had the money to pay for it My purse was in a hidden cubby under the register and he went and got it for me while LP guy takes it upon himself to call the cops My manager returned and I proceeded to show him that I had more then enough money to pay for the itemLP guy shoots back that I wouldnt of tried to hide the box in my apron if thats what I was going to do I angrily explained that I didnt need the whole store knowing my business and I was going to be discrete He wasnt going for it In a store frequented by wealthy elderly people shoplifting wasnt an issue and I believe in his mind he was finally getting the chance to bust someone I demanded to call my mother No it wasnt because I needed my mommy it was because I wanted a ride home Youre  sweetheart No mommies here and he ripped the phone from my hand Up until this point I had raised my voice but had refrained from cussing name calling etc I had just found out I was pregnant and within minutes of trying to soak that in I had a man who had obviously failed the training to be a cop accusing me of trying to steal a  pregnancy test I was emotional and I dont think anyone could blame meHe slammed a piece of paper in front of me and began to demand I sign it It was a statement saying I admit to stealing I refused and attempted to leave He blocked the door and told me I wasnt going anywhere and physically seated me again He kept screaming and pointing at the paper and I was praying that the cops would just show up He tells me I cant leave the office until I sign it and left the room locking the door behind him It was a big door and there was no way I could force it down I took the opportunity to call my mom and simply got the words Come quick out of my mouth before he stormed back in and removed the phone from the room altogether At that moment I tried to juke him to get out of the office to find he had manned the hallway with some of the stock guys and I was physically pushed back into the room and locked in once againI was in complete panic mode After what seemed like a lifetime I just signed the paper and as I was sliding it under the door as proof I heard the sounds of police radios FINALLYLP guy opens the door an enters with  officers He had obviously already gone thru his version of things and now they wanted to hear from me I went thru the whole thing and the stock guys confirmed that paying for things postbreak was common I showed them my money etc They could tell I was flustered and one noted the pee stick in the table and saw that it was positiveThey talked amongst themselves for a few minutes before I heard my mother at the customer service desk demanding to know where I was she dont play The Officers close the door so its just me LP guy and themDid she attempt to leave the store without paying one askedNo I caught her in the aisle LP respondedSo she wasnt near an exit running Anything like that one of them askedNo Caught the sneaky bitch before she could leaveTo me Were you clicked back inYes I was headed to my register to pay like EVERYONE doesLying bitch LP shot back Meanwhile I could hear the manger trying to keep my mom from ripping his throat out yes my mother is THAT toughI was gonna leave I dont have a car I dont even drive you fucking moron The officers turned to LP guy who was gripping my signed statement Ok From what weve gathered she was in the clock and following your stores policy She didnt try to leave so no shoplifting or attempted shoplifting occurredLP began to argue only to be met by a quick and authoritative hand in his face Sir you moved this girl against her will about  feet Another hundred and wed be arresting you for kidnapping You locked her in this office Thats imprisonment he may have used a different term cant recall and the fire Marshall would have your headLP shoved the paper at them She admitted itThe officer grinned That was signed under duress and my partner and I will testify to that if need be If you lock someone in a room long enough you can force them to admit to just about anythingSecond cop Miss this seems like a real shitty case of jumping the gun Do you want to press chargesHER For what LP guy freakedI just told you Youd be better at your job if you watched AND listenedI told them No Not only did I have to tell my panicked mom I was pregnant but I had to explain this too I didnt want to get wrapped up in any of that I just wanted to go home and cry I put the  on the desk table and one of the officers escorted me to the customer service desk and assured my mother I wasnt in trouble in fact I was a victim My manager was clueless as to what had just happened and the officers merely told him She could have brought major trouble for this place I wouldnt fire her if I were youBefore he could answer I merely said Fuck this job and left with my mother A year later the chain went bankrupt and a few months after that I saw LP guy pumping ppls gas in NJ If youre out their LP guy FUCK YOUEDIT First of all thank you for all your kind words I never expected one of the worst days of my life would touch so many people Looking back yes I should have pressed charges In that moment tho I just wanted out Id never had any dealings with the law before this and had no idea what pro bono meant etc My whole life had changed in that bathroom and my head was swimming and I felt like I was trying to breathe underwater If something like this happened now I would be all over it with an army of lawyers but at the time I was still a kid I have no idea if they fired LP guy over this I only went back  weeks later to collect my final paycheck I could of had it mailed but I wanted to walk in with my head held high and thats just what I did A small way of taking back my own sense of security I hope no one ever has to go thru what I went thru that day and I also hope that if anyones rights are violated they are braver then I and do press charges That is something I regret immensely about the situation but in my eyes at the time an  year old vs an army of corporate

FredFltStn,202,435,1nkw27,1190,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square foot of fireworks heavenIve posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted if youre interestedSTORY  I setup in a smaller city in Central Florida and I go through the local police department to hire off duty officers for security when the tent is really busy The officers love the duty shift since its usually just getting paid to sit around and BS with my dad eat my moms fantastic Cajun food seriously we now post a menu when we post the signup sheet and make sure that any thief or idiot thinks twice before doing something stupid Im basically paying for peace of mind and to support local law enforcement always a good idea if youre a business ownerOver the years weve become good friends with several of the police officers and its not uncommon for the Officers on Duty to swing by and say hello When they are working security for us they are officially off duty with the city but for a police officer off duty is a relative term Theyre still in uniform and in communication via radio Here are a few of the crazy things involving our Security Detail that have happened over the years  The officer was talking with a few customers when a call came over his radio He jumped up ran to his car and peeled out of the parking lot Someone had robbed the bank across the street and about a half block down from us We can actually see the front door of the bank from inside the tent The officer arrived at the bank just as the robber was taking off in his car The officer forced him off the road and they busted him a few blocks away  Im setup in the parking lot of a large shopping center A manager from one of the businesses saw the police car parked by my tent and walked over to complain to the officer about a van parked across the lot near his store It was apparently abandoned there a week ago and was partially blocking one of the rows When the officer walked over to investigate he discovered the owner had ODd inside the van a week ago He spent the rest of the day overseeing the investigation and cleanup  I was running errands and passed by the tent when I saw three police cars and the Fire Marshall truck parked next to it I panicked and did a Uturn so I could find out what was going on Pulled into the parking lot like a maniac and rushed to the tent Mom had made gumbo There were two officers that that just gotten off duty and one of the on duty officers having lunch The Fire Marshall had seen the police cars and stopped in to see what was up  I needed a new pair of underwear  The officer was sitting a table with my dad having lunch when his radio went off Bank Robbery Same bank  months later The robber had already fled the scene when the call came through Our officer left to help in the search I think they caught the guy a couple of weeks later  A police officer we know stopped by one evening to let me know that someone had used a stolen credit card at my store that day A woman couldnt find her purse and had called the credit card company The CC company gave her a list of charges that had been done that day on her card and she contacted the police It was a big purchase around  and fortunately the cashier remembered the couple that had used the card The Police took both of our statementsFour days later the couple walks into our tent again and starts to shop The cashier immediately recognized them and grabbed me to let me know We actually had an officer on site for security at the time and I quietly let her know the thieves were back She stepped out of the tent and called for backup on the radio There were a couple dozen people shopping at the time including  or  kids I decided to demo a fountain in the parking lot so we rounded up all the kids and had them leave the tent to go and watch Four police officers swooped in and busted the couple They didnt put up a fightThey found  stolen purses in their car and lots of merchandise including my fireworks I was one of several companies to press charges They ended up taking a plea and are still in prison as far as I know To this day I am still amazed that they had to balls to walk right past the police officer at our door after ripping me off a few days earlierA quick follow up and vent by meThe stolen fireworks were seized as evidence After the thieves took a plea deal the day of the trial ALL of the stolen merchandise including the fireworks were awarded by the judge to the families of the defendants  Thats rightthe judge gave all of the stolen merchandise to the families of the thieves They had hit almost a dozen stores I think they hit WalMart for more than K including gift cards While we LOVE our local law enforcement not really a big fan of the court system I spent hours doing statements interviews and depositions As a reward I was ripped off again this time by the court systemApologies for the rant,Our Security Team is never off duty and we appreciate it,1625

afternoon we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind rain and lightning It really came up on us fast and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time I grabbed all of my help and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruinedWe managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage We did however get totally soaked while all of this was going on my cashier was still ringing out customers and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent No offense but in a lighting storm I dont even want to be in a tent in a parking lotOf course thats about the time we lost power It was early afternoon so we didnt really need lights inside of the tent and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies UPS so they dont cut out every time the power fails My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door About  minutes later the power still hasnt come back on its still pouring outside and the UPSs give up the ghost and run out of juiceNot a problem I was a boy scout and I have a backup plan for my backup plan My parents RV has a generator so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that so I cant just flip a switch and make it happen but its doableMy dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch While Im out in the storm one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tentAt my counter screaming at my cashier is uber bitch UB Shes pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase just because the registers are dead My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly and they would ring her up as soon as possible but UB didnt want to hear about itThis particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point and her father is one of my best friends Shed actually graduated high school and was home from college on summer break working for me I always joke with her that shes the boss and Im just there to do her biddingMy cashier is keeping her cool but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation UB demands to check out NOW because she has somewhere that she needs to be and I need to take care of itIm soaked to the bone and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that She actually had a pretty big purchase and when I told her the total she didnt believe it She wanted to see my phone to verify She then went down the list of stuff at least  items and questioned each price When she was doing this she actually found a mistake I had made I had entered in an item as  when it should have been  The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phoneYou should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her and then gave her the new HIGHER total I should mention that the entire time theres a crowd of people around watching the scene and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happenedWhen I told her the new total she lost her GD mind She started screaming at me that it was my fault and that she shouldnt have to pay for my mistake In fact she should get a discount for having to wait so long I let her yell for a good two or three minutes just standing there expressionlessIm tired Im soaked to the bone and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf then I turned to uber bitch and told her Youre going to need to go somewhere else because youre not allowed to shop here anymoreI turned to my cashier in front of the customer and told her Dont sell that bitch anythingShe left screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rainONE YEAR LATERThe same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent Its the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before and shes shopping with three or four other people To be honest even after seeing the lady I didnt place her face If my cashier wouldnt have recognized her Id have never noticed she was thereCASHIER What would you like me to doME Its up to you Youre the bossThe lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout When UB got to the register my petite  year old female cashier stood her gound looked her dead in the eye and told her Im sorry you may have forgotten but youre not allowed to shop hereStone Cold BabyThe lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group In the end one of the people in the group paid for the stuff and they walked out confused as hell If youve seen any of my staff photos

kaithekender,148,246,1dxito,1157,About a year ago I started working at a large retail chain The particular location I was employed at was going through a lot of changes in management procedures and the like Basically the store was in a shambles logistically and couldnt keep employees for more than a month or two at bestBeyond the usual age verification for certain items there was no standard procedure followed by anybody with regards to people purchasing tobacco lottery or basically any highvalue items that had to be stored behind the counter We would take the items scan them and put them on the counter while the customer paid for them Didnt have any issuesOne day we had a loss prevention guy come in and observe our security procedures One of his suggestions was that when making these kind of sales we do not place them in reach of the customers until they are paid for in full Okay seems reasonable Nobody should have a problem with this unless they actually plan to steal shit rightNot so From the time we implemented the measure there was ONE GUY a regular who came in to buy cigarettes every day and he had a huge problem with thisWhere are my cigarettesTheyre here behind the counter sirWell why arent they in my hand yetBecause you have not yet paid for them sir We have new security measures in place to prevent potential lossesSo you think Im going to steal themNo sirWell then put them in my fucking handNo sir that would breach proper procedure I dont think youre going to steal them but this is the rule and it will be followedI dont care what the rule is you have no right to treat me like a criminal Now put the smokes in my hand or Im going to talk to your managerOkay sir Ill call him from the backSo I rang the button that dingdonged the backroom and an assistant manager came out and asked what was going on They talked for a while and decided that I would place the cigarettes in his hand breaching procedure and making me look like an assholeSo I did And the guy smirks at me and says There was that so hard At least your managers are competent Maybe you should get a job cleaning toilets or something seems more your speed Right in front of my managerAt this point I looked at my manager and said Hey Mike did you hear what he just said to me That was an abusive comment and Im not going to take itI told him to hand back the cigarettes and get out of the store but he refusedYou put them in my hand theyre mine now take my money or dont theyre mineSo I looked at my manager and said This is what happens when you dont follow procedure and make me look like an idiot Mike This is your problem now I quitAnd I walked out Abusive customers suck and managers who abide them are worseEDIT Guys dont downvote people just for respectfully suggesting that I could have done things differently If somebodys being an asshole and lobbing insults fine But theres a comment from MrJigglyBrown buried down there that I dont feel warrants the negative attention its receiving He seems like an OK guy ,IM NOT A CRIMINAL,1403
haloto,244,275,1f3mat,1154,To start off these are going to be a short series of stories that Ive stored from my time working at an law enforcement officer LEO retail store Despite the title its by no means meant to be political argument for or against guns Its just well youll see And sorry for the lengthI did a post about this store called You think you had a bad dayhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsejoeryouthinkyouhadabadday Anyways onto the storiesFirst ExperiencesBefore starting working where I work now I only had limited experience with guns firearms weapons etc I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter One of the people training me laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed These rules are The weapon is always loaded Even when you know the weapon is unloaded Its always loaded Always point the weapon at a safe direction Never at someone See rules  and  for why When handing a weapon over to someone make sure the slidebolt is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that its cleared When a weapon is handed to you always clear it See rules  and  Never point a firearm at something that you dont intend to kill There is no such thing as shooting to injure Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing atI also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules  and  notice a theme Most people will drop sight line raise the weapons barrel to point at the ceiling lower the weapon down etc to let me pass Cool no problemMy first day behind the gun counter and the first customer I had behind there wanted to see a Glock  I remove the weapon from the case clear it locked the slide back handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands Problem He was pointing it right at me I moved to the side to get out of the line of fire and he followed meSir could you please not point the weapon at meWhy its not loadedI dont care please dont point the weapon at meStop being such aAt this point a coworker whos been there for  years reaches out grabs the slide from the top breaks the guys grip and tells him to leaveWhy do I have to leaveBecause you arent being safe with the weapon You need to leave nowFuck you I want to see a managerFine My coworker calls out a name Down at the other end of the counter is the president of the company The name called was his My coworker tells the president what just happened including the fuck you part the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me Yes sir asked the customer if he did point the gun at me Yeah but it was unloaded The president looks at the guy and says matter of factlyGet the fuck out of my store and dont come backThe guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it saying that he shouldnt be talking to a customer that way which was meet with a reply of you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees The guy wasnt moving and was getting more and more angry Since we are cater to LEO and military we usually have a sheriff police officer constable state police federal agent in store The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that theres five officers looking at him ready to take him out of the store and to downtownjail if he doesnt leave nowOfficers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerks assFine Im never coming here again The customer saidI know and I dont care the big boss saidYes we accept tradesAfter a while you get to feel for how heavy a weapon is unloaded and can tell when it is loaded even if you never held a loaded weapon before Theres a certain weight to it and the balance is differentSo we take trades This guy comes in looking to trade his shotgun for credit to get a different shotgun No biggie We do this all the time We tell him to bring in the weapon and make sure its cleared He brings in the shotgun and hands it to me It felt different HeavierAre you sure this is clearedYeah I cleared it before I put it in the carSo most of you know its not very smart to carry a loaded shotgun in a cartruck or have one in the chamber because it can accidentally discharge Shotguns dont usually have a drop safety and some hard bumps can make the hammer strike the shell causing an accidental discharge Its illegal at least in my state to have a loaded shotgun in the vehicle for these reasonsI rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead I follow the shell in flight in slow motion as I see it hit him in the head thinking What the fuck manI rack it six more timesSix more shells go flying outHe is told to put the shells back in his car and well finish the trade when he comes back in He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangersI need a holsterWe sell anything an officer needs duty gear pants holsters accessories for their weapons badges vehicle equipment you name it we have it or can get it So a local officer comes in and needs a holsterWe can help you with a holster What weapon do you haveI dont knowThis happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying If my sample size is any indication about other officers a good  dont know what side arm they carry We ask if he has it with him he says yes and we tell him to clear the weapon lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holsterHe comes back in with a weapon cleared We see that its a common weapon and we have different holsters for it and show him the holsters As he is looking at the holster someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon He drops the slide which chambers a round The gun is now hot live and ready to shoot Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster The weapon is stuckFuck us a loaded gun is stuck in a holster Coworker gets that look of slight panic I grab the weapon and holster from the customer drop the magazine and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out but its gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others hes not allowed in there I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he isHes cool with this and does feel very stupid Im cant really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safeSo I take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely I call in two other more experience coworkers to help figure this out After some cussing grumbling lots of WD and talk about taking a saw to the holster we finally got it freeThe next day everyone got a lecture and retaining on weapon safetyIm on the SWAT teamPeople come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes Sheriffs at least in my part of the woods tend to be on the bigger size of thingsThis big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT riguniform He has a purchase order from his department He needs everything new body armor clothing thigh rig chest holster sling for the AR he has to get new duty belt rig the whole nineThe problem We didnt have anything that fit himWe can measure for body armor as those are custom made But the sheet measurements didnt go that bigPants We didnt have anything close to his size I had to take a measuring tape or two to get the guys waist size We had to order a XL For frame of reference Im a size  waist When these pants finally came in myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more peopleOf course he was offended that everything had to be custom made that we didnt have it in stock and would be up charged for the size which the department PO didnt take into accountThe horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door have him scream OH YEAHAlright I think this is long enough I have other stories that Ill share at a later time EnjoyEdit minor typos,Tales from the Gun Store or How I Learned to Embrace Gun

jessbakescakes,140,225,1g32dd,1150,So weve all had the parents come into our workplace and let their kids run wilddestroy the storetreat employees like crap I once had a parent dump a kids piggy bank on the counter and sit and laugh while I counted out all the change But today I had a good experience with a parent and wanted to shareThe little kid was about  years old and had clearly been saving for this toy for awhile He had his money all wadded up in his hand like crumbled and stuff His mom caught it as he was handing it to me and she crouched down to his levelMom Now look at what youre about to give her What would you think if someone gave that to you Would that be very niceThe little boy looked at his hand and kind of shrugged Mom Lets unfold this and count it out When you buy something you always hand the nice lady or man your money the way youd want your money handed to you So that means you count it out and you unfold it and you put it in their hand and not on the counter You wouldnt like it if someone just dropped it in front of you so thats how we treat other peopleI basically wanted to hug this mom It took her kid an extra minute or so to unwad his bills but the gesture was so nice I love when parents teach their kids some respect and courtesy its so rare sometimes and it just really warms my heart when they do,A thank you to the awesome parents,1375
Digimule,161,236,1d5w8y,1152,JusticePorn didnt like my submission because I dont have any proof to show this happened but its related to working in retail so I hope you all like itYears ago I was attending a local college learning computer repair and networking A guy in my class who was known for being a braggart worked parttime at a big box store that serviced and sold computers He came in one day bragging about his new processor and how much faster his computer ran now He was just dying to tell us how hed outsmarted a different big box store and come out of it with a free processorHe told us how hed gone into the store and bought a brand new processor He took it home installed it in his computer and put his old one back in the box He then returned it to the store and got his money back claiming it was defectiveOf course this is clearly theft and it made all of us uncomfortable to hear about and the instructor shook his head sadly at himThe next day he didnt show up for class Neither did he show up the second day On the third day he came back and was raging mad that things were unfair He told us hed taken the two days off to cool down because he was so angry at what had happened to himIt turns out that in addition to bragging to us hed also bragged to all his coworkers at the big box store He thought theyd love his story because hed done the stealing from a competitorHis boss was disgusted by his actions and phoned up the store hed ripped off and told them what hed done He told them that the thief would be coming in and returning the real processor and gave them the guys full name and phone number in case he skipped out on it The braggart was afraid of losing his job at this point so he manned up and took back what hed stolen As soon as his boss had confirmation that things had been put right he fired the guyI really like to think that the guy learned something from the whole ordeal but the way he was raging about how unfairly hed been treated I doubt ittldr Bosses dont like to hear they have a stupid thief working for them,Guy I went to school with thinks hes clever for ripping off a big box store His boss at a competing big box store doesnt agree,1388

FredFltStn,302,450,1q3l7r,1136,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  I had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks The customer was hearingimpaired and the call was being conducted through a TDD device using an operator If youve never communicated over a TDD through an operator it can be exasperating and I feel terrible for the hearing impaired people who have to use oneBasically you tell the operator whatever youd like to say making sure to speak slowly The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard and then sends it to the hearing impaired user The user then reads the message types in their reply and sends it back to the operator The operator then reads the reply back to you Sometimes it can take minute or two for all this to happen so youre basically saying a couple of sentences or asking a question waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply and then speaking again Its like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the moonApparently the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in June and was mad because some of them didnt work  I give an unconditional money back guarantee on everything I sell and I always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuffI apologized profusely and since my store is seasonal and had already closed I offered to send him a check to refund his purchase Normally Id want to see a receipt or have them bring back the duds but because of the TDD wed already been on the phone for more than  minutes at that point I felt bad for the guy and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy Two minutes later  TDD delay Unfortunately that wasnt the answer he was looking for Instead he wanted me to replace his fireworks I offered to meet him somewhere and bring him replacementsTwo minutes later I was informed that he lived an hour away and couldnt get over to Orlando Instead he wanted me to mail him the fireworksNow fireworks are considered hazardous materials and cant be shipped through the regular mail Because of the expense and problems associated with this I dont ship fireworks I let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the dudsTwo minutes later I was again told that I needed to mail him fireworks since I had a guarantee and the fireworks he had purchased were bad Once again I explained to the operator that I didnt mail fireworks but that Id be happy to send a check Two minutes later Hes now really mad at me and yelling that I can send him a check and hell go to another fireworks company to get his stuff I only know that he was yelling because the TDD operator informed me that he was typing emphaticallyThats rightI was being yelled at by a hearing impaired person over the phone through an operator translating the callI asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were duds so I could figure out the cost and mail him a check I also told him that I would need his home addressTwo minutes later Its a box of firecrackers A Fcking  box of firecrackers I had now spent  minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that some of the firecrackers in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased themI immediately sent him a check for  through online banking I filled out the note field on the check It read Please shop somewhere else Unfortunately it can take up to  days for the check to arrive when its a new entry onlineThe bastard called me back every day until he got the check When the TDD operator would identify themselves I would just say The check is in the mail and hang up If youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Please shop somewhere else Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1586

thekrone,205,301,1ihulr,1132,WARNING NSFW languageHey allThis is a story from many years ago back when I used to work at a electronics  computer  appliance  media retailer Sorry its so long I get verbose sometimesThe backstoryApparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator They found a couple they liked for something around  They picked one and paid for it on their credit card They set it up to be delivered some time a few days later No real issues at this pointThe next day the woman came back in They decided they had changed their minds and didnt want that specific refrigerator anymore and wanted to think about switching to the other one they liked instead No problem Delivery was canceledThis is where the core problem occurred She neglected to bring the credit card presumably her husbands they had originally paid with back in At this time I dont know if its different now I havent worked there in over a decade we could only process a credit card return if we had the original card to put the money back on She didnt have it and they lived an hour awayA manager was called over This manager told the woman in front of two different customer service reps that because she didnt have the credit card we could only process the return for store credit unless of course she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card The woman was not happy about this but agreed since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anywayAs the manager was processing the return he very specifically said something along the lines of Just so you know after the close of business today we will no longer be able to undo this transaction You will be stuck with the store credit and theres absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card give it back to you in cash etc If you want the money back on the credit card you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day and then we have a way well be able to put the money back on the card After the close of business though theres literally nothing we can do to get the money back on the cardThe woman acknowledged this accepted the store credit voucher and went on her wayNow heres where I come inThe next day Im working Loss Prevention for the store standing at the front checking receipts monitoring cameras etc Nothing out of the usual was happening when all of a sudden I hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk A woman is yelling at one of the customer service representatives something along the lines of You guys are thieves Give me back my money It was the woman from the day before At this point I have no idea what the situation is thoughI ask someone to cover the desk for me and head over to see what is going on The manager who had helped her out the day before happened to be there He arrived at customer service desk at the same time I didApparently when her husband got home from work that night after we had already closed he informed her that he had already purchased another refrigerator from one of our competitors assuming she would be able to handle the return of the one they had purchased from us She informed him of the store credit situation and he got pissed She was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible The manager did what he could to calm the woman down She was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money etc The manager reminded the woman of the conversation they had the day before Of course she accused the manager of lying and said he never told her anything like that However he had witnesses and in addition that exact policy was spelled out in plain English on both her receipt and the wall right next to her It was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone At this point she had  store credit and you cant return store credit He apologized but said there was nothing he could do and asked her to step aside if she didnt have any other businessShe stepped aside but then just started swearing at every customer as they approached the customer service desk Dont fucking buy anything from these assholes They will steal your fucking money At the point I had to ask her to leave as she was causing a disturbance She complied but on her way out yelled I am calling my husband Wait until he gets here You fuckers will all payFast forward a few hours and in storms the most irate looking man Ive ever seen in my life Face beet red fists clenched looking like hes ready to punch the first person who says a word to him Hes not a big dude or anything but he looks pissed He storms up to me and to his credit quite calmly says Please point me towards customer service I point He heads off that wayI know theres going to be trouble at this point so I call back to the warehouse and ask for the biggest guys back there to come up to the front I lucked out We had a guy back there who was about  probably  lbs and another who was about   At this point I was about  and maybe  Together we were a formidable enough force that I figured wed be able to handle whatever happened I got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer serviceBy the time I get there the dude is already screaming his ass off at some poor  year old customer service rep who is desperately trying to get anyones attention to come help her The manager gets there just as I do again and tries to calm the man down The man isnt hearing a word of it though He throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service reps face and says If that money doesnt get back on that card in the next two minutes something bad is going to happen Well he was rightI approach the man from behind and I see the two guys from the warehouse jogging up The manager says Sir your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return Theres literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for youThe man replies Bullshit You guys can do it And you will do itMy manager Sir I assure you we literally cant The system wont allow it Theres nothing we can do You need to leaveThe man says No Fuck that Im not leaving until I get my money I dont care how Pull  cash out of the drawer I dont care Give me my fucking moneyMy manager says Sir we cant help you The corporate number is on your original receipt Maybe they can do something We cant do it here You need to calm down and leave the premises nowThe guy says Im not going anywhere Fuck youManager says I have now asked you to leave If you dont leave the premises in the next  seconds Im calling the police and having you arrested for trespassingThe guy responds Fuck you Call them I dont give a fuckSo the manager picks up the phone and starts dialing Meanwhile the dude starts screaming at the customer service rep again who just looks like a deer in headlights I say firmly Sir you have been asked to leave You are trespassing It is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worseThis apparently startled him He didnt know I was there He quickly turns and swings at me Luckily for me the dude was off balance and threw a terrible punch so I was able to dodge out of the way of it I charge him and slam him into the customer service desk The other two dudes from the warehouse jump in and we wrestle the guy to the ground where the  lbs dude just holds him downThe guy hilariously squirms and flails beneath the weight of this huge guy swearing up a storm Ah fuck you get off me fuck you pieces of shit fucking assholes This lasted for a couple of minutes After realizing hes not nearly strong enough to get out of the situation he starts to calm down and bargain Okay okay youre right I should just go Just let me up and Ill leave calmlyMy manager having gotten off the phone with the police at this point says We gave you plenty of chances for that You decided not to go At this point you assaulted one of my employees and you are going to go to jailAnd went to jail he did He was charged with battery for throwing the cards in the customer service reps face assault for verbal threats such as something bad is going to happen and swinging at me and trespassing failing to leave the premises when ordered He plead guilty across the board I never heard what his sentence wasAnd thats the time I was assaulted because of a refrigerator,The time I was assaulted over a refrigerator,1433

umegatron,84,276,1jac0b,1109,So i work in a very high end chocolate store and i kid you not when i say we make the best chocolate in the world  How high end you ask  Some of our coworkers wanted to jazz our days up by attacthcing spoons to the pens we use for credit card reciepts and draw some smiley faces on them  Our boss sat us all down and explained that we were way too classy of a store to allow that to happenWe usually give out samples of fudge or ice cream whenever people ask for them but when its really busy and the store is full we just put out a plate and let people go after them  A little risky perhaps but we seem to have faith in the goodness of our customers something i tend to doubt from time to time  One busy day we had a bunch of caramel bars out in the store for people to sample and a group of people are gathering around them all of the sudden we hear a voice call out above the othersOH MY GOD  I found a tooth in the chocolateMy manager and i snap into action all these companies and other industries have been in a lot of trouble when people find body parts in their food so we wanted to difuse the situation as fast as possible  Unfortunately if you find a tooth and start shouting about it in front of a bunch of people you will start what we in the retail world refer to as a stampede  MY manager handled the situation wonderfully  She apologized profusely gave the lady a bunch of free chocolate and took the tooth away and threw it out  Our whole store empties out as no one wants to buy the toothy chocolate anymore  Our manager also dons our version of a HAZMAT suit and removes the tooth from our proximityA few minutes pass then we see the tooth lady open our door and walk back into the store  She walks up to the manager and in a very quiet voice tells herSo that actually was my tooth it just popped out in the bar when i chewed it and i didnt want people to know  Could i have it back  My manager was very calm and explained that she had acted as if the tooth wasnt hers so we handled it the way we had to handle it if we found a foreign object in our product we throw it away immediately  The lady has a meltdown YOU STOLE MY TOOTH  YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK ITS MINE  To which my manager responded If you had been honest with us and not tried to incite panic from our customers we could have simply given you back your tooth  But you decided to cover up your problem and create one for us  Luckily we address our problems immediatley and effectivley something you could stand to learn fromThe lady obviously humiliated straightened up took one more caramel sample and walked out the front door minus one toothtldr  lady lost a tooth in our sample then blamed it on us then came back and asked for her tooth back,This lady tried to frighten the entire store,1385

Im at work now on break and Im really floored with how many pople liked the way I wrote this out Thank you all for your own similar stories your advice and your Pokemonrelated comments Above all I want to give a shout out for those who worked Black Friday Thanks for toughing it out you all have the patience of a saint Thank you for making my week Reddit    Black Friday was thankfully somewhat kind to our store I work as a receptionist in a bigname motorcycle dealership and I am happy to report that the small crowd we had was wellbehaved and generally pleasant to be around Honestly bikers looking to get a couple cheap teeshirts and some reducedprice parts are pretty mellow fellows When closing time rolled around there was very little to clean up and I couldve counted on one hand how many calls wed received in the past hour    I was expecting based upon the time and what Id bore witness to that most other stores in the area would have a reduction in traffic Seeing as Id just gotten my check and the banks were of course closed at that hour I decided to head to the superstore in the area My plan was to go in cash the check and see if I could pick up a couple packs of cards before heading another hour down the road for home    Right off the bat upon pulling into the parking lot I could tell Id been wrong The zookeepers were apparently on leave because the animals were still there I should have just left and taken myself further down south towards home but Id just noticed my poor and loyal beast had an empty tank The only way to quench the thirst of this monster is a cool  and a pump and I was out of money For you then you poor dear    Check in hand I entered the fray and immediately beelined for the money center Weaving between buggies of children televisions and food not necessarily in that order I managed to finally cross the threshhold and enter the rope lines That was the first time I heard what I was going to hear the entire half hour I was in the store    Ahscuse me    There was no one near me in the lines so I continued to walk It was then that a set of talons took the edge of my shirt sleeve tugging me back a step    AHSCUSE ME DON JUS WALK AWAY FROM ME    Inwardly I began to panic Whoever this was was out for blood and it was mine My inner monologue began to replay the past couple minutes Who in the world could I have angered in that short time Slowly I turned to face the bird of prey that had cornered me Beside her was a nestlike buggy with two small children in them and all three of them were staring right at me    Where yo bathrooms at She squawked    I not being from the area shrugged Idont know Im sorry    WHATCHU MEAN YOU DONT KNOW Her cry rang out causing other animals of the hunt to perk up The sound echoed with tones of going in for a kill and I was the hapless victim WHERE YO MANAGUH    Then it clicked For some reason this furious fowl seemed to think I was her usual prey She had somehow confused the black button up shirt with white pinstripes plastered with our black and orange logo and name for the blue shirts the poor employees of the super store had She had seen my name tag but her eyes had blacked out the barandshield logo right beside it She had been leering at my back with my stores name and logo on it and in her mind thought I worked here    Having tried to process these facts and gotten the blue screen I finally decided to tell this woman what I was sure she shouldve known I dontworkhere    There was silence She leered and glared and stared at me for a moment longer before huffing Ohwell Im sorry You sho look like it She strutted away her children still staring around her at me before I could ask how in the world she couldve thought that I was too grateful to be clear of the situation however and instead of chasing her down I crawled through the line and cashed my check It was over I was free This wasnt so bad I decided Id go and get my cards after all Surely I thought as I strolled out of the safety of the center and out towards the aisles that would be the only    MISS MISS MISS CAN YOU HELP ME FIND THE LADIES NIGHTGOWNS    I dont know where they are Im sorry I dont work here There okay that was handled he was walking away    Maam My son spilled his drink over there    Iokay    Where are you going People could slip in that Came the reply I kept walking I was regretting this already I should haven taken off the name tag and the shirt right then and there but I was cold and there was nowhere to put the tag HEY YOURE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN THIS UP    Id had enough Slowly I turned around and pointed at my shirt right where my store name was Maam I work for THIS company I dont know WHERE they keep the mop here    She just gawked at me like I was speaking some dead language So youre just going to stand there Wow They hire people like you here    I work for Motorcycle Dealership maam I dont work here    OhOH I left her as she tried to pick up the broken pieces of her life from where Id shattered it I was almost to the cards If I could just get to where the Pokemon were staring at me with sympathy I could snag a couple and head for a checkout    Ugh I cannot BELIEVE thiswhy dont they have more people on the lines Because theyre all busy helping out other customers You know WORKING I refrained from rolling my eyes Keldeo was welcoming me to the promised land HEY HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOUR JOB AND GET ON A REGISTER Nope not me Nope    What is it with people and thinking its perfectly okay to GRAB SOMEONE Someone snatched the wrist holding my wallet and I thought for sure I was going to be robbed What are you doing Get off me    Dont ignore me when Im talking to you The lady was close to fifty looked neat and proper and oozed anger like a cyst Youre not doing anything go and do your    I was done I was so done It was my own fault for coming into the store in my work shirt and name tag but I was not going to be grabbed at twice in one night    MAAM read my shirt I work for a BIKE SHOP Im here doing my own shopping Just because you have to wait five minutes doesnt mean you can just GRAB people Shut up turn around and just WAIT Someone will get to you as soon as they can    The entire area went dead silent People were staring at me once again but I was too upset to care The woman who had an iron grip on my wrist looked as though shed stepped in something nasty and she finally let go She stepped back into her line muttering about how that wasnt necessary The complaints stopped I slithered over to the card rack and picked up my two precious packs of cards I ended up in the line beside the same woman whod grabbed me so she was glaring at me the whole time    Hun    I closed my eyes briefly and looked at the man in front of her He just grinned Biddies like that is why I drink Gimme your cards I gottem    In the end he walked me out to my car and wished me a good night I went home and told everyone how grateful I was that I worked where I did I felt so bad for the employees No one should ever be treated like that where they work No one    tldr Went into the jungle and was attacked by animals while

DeathAndTheGirl,221,333,1kvgua,1102,The mallIf youve worked in retail those words make you cringe the mall Ive worked in several stores in our local mall At one point a local tattoo shop had opened up at the end that me and my two roommates worked at When that didnt pay my bills sufficiently I applied across the street the aisle separating the lines of stores at a scrapbooking store Ive never done that beforescrapbook but Ive worked retail and who the hell cant sell paper and stickers right Right I actually loved the job  I worked  there then  at the tattoo parlor  I went  weeks without a day off but both jobs were so chill it didnt bother me  The scrap store was slow and the customers were mostly middle aged to elderly women who were very sweet  In the morning before the stores open we have Mall Walkers Im sure your mall has this too  Elderly and the mentally and physically handicap make laps around the mall for exercise  One of the mentally handicapped men took a shine to me I suppose  When hed reach my store he would hang onto the closed gate and watch me set up my daily displays count my till typical morning duties  Id wave and go back to whatever  No big deal He would do this every morning for about fifteen minutes for a few weeks My roommates would be across the way opening the tattoo shop and would smile and shake their head watching himwatch me Eventually I suppose he decided he could come see me AFTER the store had been opened Around noonhed wander in and too shy to say much would touch the prettier papers or sit at one of our craft tables Usually for about an hour I assumed he was taking the city bus given his schedule He never bothered me he was quiet and didnt mess up any of the stock I was so used to him that when Id get lunch Id sometimes get him some sort of sugary pastry Cupcake or cookie Hed get all big eyed and thank me profusely  Im not sure what disability he had but he was often with the crew of disabled He didnt have Downs but his speech and physical movements indicated it was mental He wore the same outfit everyday jeans bootsleather jacket and was probably about  and middle aged This went on from November until February For valentines day he came in and gave me a bouquet of purple flowers made from construction paper  In his own way he told me the flowers matched my hair  I was incredibly moved and almost cried He then leaned over as if to hug me  I went to return this hug until he grabbed my face and attempted to kiss me I tried to pull back but was unable due to what I assumed at that time wasretard strength I apologize for the insensitivity but thats exactly what went through my mind in this moment He wrapped his arms tightly around me and would not let me go He was  ferociously petting my hair smelling me and kissing me wherever he could reach I screamed for my roommate who saw what you happening and came rushing over  He pulled the man off of me in a very rough way while trying to chide him like a child  No We dont kiss strangers Stop it To which ourmentally challenged friend respondedhey man I was just trying to cop a feel We both stared as the man began to laugh and walked away  He walked away without any twitches or tics and even waved goodbye to us  In a few short moments he made it very clear that he was not mentally challenged at all He had fooled both of us this entire time  side note this is not to say people with mental  retardation cannot wave or speak  But his speech and mannerisms were quite different than before demonstrating that he did not have any handicaps whatsoever,Catfished bymentally challenged customer,1435
FredFltStn,278,351,1o59gs,1097,For several years I worked as a catering manager with a large entertainment company located in Orlando I previously posted some of these as a comment to someone elses thread It got me thinking about all of the crazy requestsissues I came across while doing the job so I decided to include a few more and post them on their ownIn catering the corporate events were usually enormous sometimes with thousands of guests Amazingly these always seemed to go relatively smoothly Maybe it was because most of the companies we catered to had an entire department for planning and coordinating events and they were seasoned pros Weddings on the other hand were always a pain in the assHere are a few of the wonderful issues I encountered during my tenure Im sorry you sent out invitations asking them to choose their plated entree then decided to order the buffet because it was cheaper were not going to plate up buffet food and serve your guests once the reception has started Im sorry but you do not get a refund because the bride does not like the food Perhaps she should discuss it with the groom since he and his parents attended the tasting and selected the menu   Im sorry we ran out of food You cant order and pay for a buffet for  people then expect to feed the  people that showed up Im sorry your bar bill was so high but you did choose to have an open bar with all premium liquors  Im sorry your guests keep asking when dinner will be served Perhaps you should explain to them that you selected the Light Hors doeuvre package for your pm reception Im sorry the groom didnt show No we cant just use the food weve already cooked for our next event and give you back your money Im sorry we ruined your beautiful outdoor wedding and reception This is whats known as a hurricane and I cannot make it go away Im sorry your guests are complaining theres no meat selection on the buffet Perhaps you should have taken that into consideration when insisting on a vegetarian menuBased on all of the comments and interest user tyedye has created a rBridezillas subreddit herehttpwwwredditcomrbridezillas,Apologies to the brideAKA Im glad Im not in catering anymore,1448

metamaxwell,385,370,1r14xk,1093,So I may cry I was  minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now I have to type this again That in itself may become another postDisclaimer Standard stuff First time post Massive wall of text etcBackground I work at a small privately owned retro game store You name it I have something for itNow this tale takes place a few days after GTA  came out You see on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do playing SNES games on one of our displays On the rare occasion when a customer would come in Id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help I could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in I jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with you guessed it GTA  in hand Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his  and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun Except there is one thing between him and that future A fell and powerful guardian That would be meI should take this time to mention that for the most part I dont like telling people they cant buy something It is sad not only because Im missing out on a sale but Im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you Your card was declined You have to be  or older to buy this etc are phrases I dislike Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world For you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc To you I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fatteningBack to the story So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen Now most parents fall into one of two general categories The I dont care I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the Im actually have an idea about what is going on here and Im totally cool with it now take my money type Those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally I move on and make the sale Not Mom No when I tell her about the M rating she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED My heart stopped I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin This honestly never happens Ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed Kids heart drops at this But you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming Dudebe cool NOPEI like my job and I like to think I do it well Im paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS and Xbox One afterall So when someone asks me about a game Im going to tell you EVERY THING about it And thats just what Mom gets First blow Language Moms approval doesnt take any visible damage Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle itQuick second punch Drugs and alcohol I think I saw a grimacebut Mom recovers quickly Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTRIm getting serious now Violence Finally a crack in the armor Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it Kid puts on his most mature look I swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion He does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that matureYoure doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid but I have a secret weapon Nudity Yep as some of you know GTA  didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob Nope Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but I did Critical hit TKO Mom was out She refused to get it and told Kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough I thought that was the end of it but damn Kid was quick on his feet He played the Friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call himSo she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile Im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look Ive seen Seriously I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff Oh no I mean slow and painful years of torture kind Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again Apparently Dad wasnt against it but she still was Im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her and I do and Mom gets the phone back This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game Reddit let me tell you I have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but DAMN Kid takes the cake All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book He screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly  minutes so Ill just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim Favorite  Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage Why is this hilarious Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission So yeah Also the tantrum technique Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for somethingFavorite  The xxx has it so screw you Ill just play it there Now kudos to Mom she handled this like a pro Her response You wont when I call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game Im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playingFavorite  This one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself Mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her To help her get her point across I ask if he is  she assures me he isnt and I tell them that without an ID proving he is  or older no one can legally sell him that gameThe night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior Reddit I love moments like that It had it all Drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent Oh and Kid was about  by the way Be honest you all thought he was  didnt you Ive got  years of tales piled up if you want moreTldr You guys are cheatingfine Kid pitches Mom refuses to catch,How I made a Kid cry or Tales from a

glitzycupcake,123,349,1l9wte,1093,So I worked retail on and off for a period of about  years before and during college  I know all about difficult customers  One day I was in jofab as a customer never worked there and the lady in front of me is buying fake flowers  As theyre wrapping up the transaction the elderly cashier tells the middle aged woman checking out that they dont have any large bags to use  MAW is obviously annoyed  She sees large bags behind the EC and demands she uses those  EC says shes not allowed to take those bags for whatever reason  Im like not sure why that would ever happen but maybe her manager is bitchy MAW starts huffing and puffing and looks to me for support a few times  Then she decides to be a super bitch to EC and goes if you cant give me a bigger bag then just return it all right now So she dumps out the bag of flowers and has EC return it  As shes returning it MAW keeps huffing and eye rolling and looking back at me to support her  She says something to me like can you believe this And I look at her and no lie can I believe that a grown woman is acting like a child and being extremely disrespectful to this cashier No I cant  I was raised to respect my elders but obviously you werent  Stop looking back at me to take your side because theres no way thats going to happen youre extremely rudeThat bitch didnt say a peep after and scurried out with her head between her tail  EC thanked me and gave me a coupon on my purchase  My favorite moment in retail though I wasnt working at the time,belittle the cashier and look to me for support,1442

mypenexploded,155,208,1faa34,1021,Its my first time posting here as Ive been waiting for something particularly exciting to happen at work that would be rTalesFromRetail worthy Let me tell you today took the cake I work at an international big box home improvement store as a cashier Ive been there for  years and am one of the most versatile associates on the front end I can work lumber cash garden cash returns front end cash selfcheckout customer Service Desk and Tool Rental I recently got a promotion to Head Cash basically just opening and closing all the registers and managing the cashiers and lot associates throughout the day and am in training right now for that So I go into work this morning for am to open the  registers in the store and get things ready for the day Now different parts of our store are staffed at different times of the day Lumber cash and selfcheckout open at am but I dont get a cashier in for front end cash until about  and Returns sometimes isnt open until  Its just the way our schedule runs but its fine because whoever is on selfcheckout can open up on the cash next to it and the service desk can do returns Not a big deal right Well I didnt think soSo this customer walks in at around  Theres still virtually no one in the store at this hour except for the odd contractor so when he walks up to the selfcheckout area with a couple lowticket items looking annoyed and confused I dont hesitate to call him over and open up on the regular cash right next to the selfcheckout control station He ignores the customary questions of Hi how are you today did you find everything okay will this be on a store credit card today and instead chooses to stare angrily at the screen that everything I scan is showing up on Jerk I finish the transaction with him hand him his receipt and wish him a wonderful day Fast forward about  hours Ive surrendered the head cash phone and keys and have been sent into Returns to help the girl in there clear her line up Lo and behold who walks in but Grumpy Morning Guy Well call him GMG So he gets in line and I see that he has a cart FULL of stuff none of it what I had rung up for him this morning And I knew I KNEW he was going to be trouble Anyone who works in retail can pick out a trouble maker a mile away and as I had already confirmed this morning that he wasnt the nicest of people I slowed down my last transaction just a see bit so that the girl working with me well call her M would have to deal with him I know Im a terrible person So M greats him and asks if he has a receipt for the product hes returning he says no She asks if he bought it with a credit or debit card as we can look purchases made within  days up if he had he says no She TELLS HIM his only option is a store credit he says thats fine So M gets to work scanning all the little odds and ends this guy has in his cart She totals it up and its around  She gives our manager a quick call to get permission to give him back such a large amount and she gets the go ahead as everything is in perfect condition GMG signs the pin pad to verify the return and she hands him his receipt and store credit and tells him to have a great day He looks at the card in his hand for a moment and then turns to her with a look of disgust on his faceWhat the fuck is thisI could see that M was a little taken back people arent usually so aggressive with herIts your store credit She answered politely GMG shakes his head and smiles condescendingly before flicking the card across the counter at her I want my fucking cash backOh here we go I had cleared the line by now but felt it was a good idea to stick around so I started fiddling with things behind the counterSir you dont have a receipt and you didnt buy any of it on a credit or debit card theres no way for me to give you your cash backHe gets really mad at this obvious statement of fact really what did you think was going to happen and slams his hands down on the counter leaning over it to get in her face and once more saysI WANT MY FUCKING CASHI saw that M was getting a little freaked out now so I stepped forward to help her Sir there is physically no way for us to give you back your cash The computer wont allow it You have to have your receipt or have paid with a debit card Im sorry but shes right store credit is your only optionJust PUSH the FUCKING button and give me back my FUCKING CASHOh right I totally forgot about the secret give this back in cash because I say so button GMG isnt listening to either of us so I call one of my Assistant Store Managers in Well call her D Now D is a little blonde woman not intimidating looking in the least but she doesnt take crap from customers She walks in and asks him what the problem isThese idiots wont give me back my fucking cash Well did you have your receiptNoDid you pay with a cardNoThen youre not getting your cash back We need proof of purchase to do that and seeing as you dont have any youre going to have to be happy with a store creditWHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS MY FUCKING MONEY YOU BETTER GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING CASH RIGHT NOW OR I SWEAR TO GOD I DONT HAVE A RECEIPT BECAUSE SHE FUCKING TOOK ITHes pointing at me now Whys he pointing at meOh because I took his receipt Wait whatPardonSHE took my receipt I was in here this morning and she was the one who checked me out SHE TOOK IT D turns to look at me her eyes saying What is this crazy talking about I did help him check out this morning but he only bought  things and none of them are are this table I gave you your receipt before you left sirYOU FUCKING LIAR IM GONNA FUCKING SUE FUCK FUCK FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAHSir if you dont stop swearing Im going to have to ask you to leaveHe obviously ignores her and continues on his very loud very obscene rant about how the store is trying to scam him and I stole his receipt etc At this point D gets on her walkie and radios another manager to Returns as GMG looks like hes ready to punch someone in the face Two of our male managers come in one of them is one of the biggest humans Ive ever come across in my life Im talking   lbs at least Hes a big boy and well call him JJ walks up to GMG with a HUGE smile on his face and asks him what the problem is GMG tells him very explicitly how us fucking idiot cashiers should be fired because were stealing from him J still smiling informs him that if he lets one more profanity slip he will personally remove him from store property and hold him until the police arrive ensuring that hes charged for verbally assaulting everyone in the room Now his shit eating grin has gotten wider Would you like to take your store credit and leave or would you like to lose it and leave with meGMG splutters indignantly for a moment surveys the crowd of managers associates and now customers staring at him grabs the store credit off the counter and storms out of the store Best partThe doors in front of Returns are automatic doors but they are entrance only so he ran head first into them expecting them to open up on his way through He then had to walk aaaaaall the way around the front end cash area to get to the exit while everyone in Returns laughed at his instant karma TLDR Asshole accuses me of stealing his receipt he wants his FUCKING CASH back gets told by my managers and hits his face on the doors on his way out ,YOU TOOK MY RECEIPT,1229

TennisAndBeer,119,228,1lenz1,1011,While I work in retail in this story I was actually shopping with several of my friends for this story I was at the mall with a few friends when a few of the girls wanted to go to a fairly high end womans clothing store in a nice town The guys decided to make a coffee stop to minimize the amount of time we had to spend in the store Myself and two of my buddies walked into the store just as a woman calls out Erica Erica She looks around breifly and then begins shouting ERICA ERICA A store employee comes over and asks her whats wrong She says she cant find her daughter who has long blond hair My friends and I are still by the entrance and stay there so that we could see if some sketchy guy tried to leave with a little blond girl The mother is still shouting and is at this point crying The employee asks her when and where she last saw her daughter She says thirty seconds ago and right near where she was standing The employee asks how old Erica is The mother says shes  Not  Not  Not even   years old Old enough to drive herself to the store stopping to buy lottery tickets and tobacco on the way and having a pint in pretty much any country but America The employee and the group of people who have noticed are visibly shocked and as the employee goes to page her the daughter walks over from two sections away unbelievably embarrassed that her mother is at this point screaming her name and sobbing Just as the icing on the cake both the girl and the mother were holding cell phones So rather than call her phone the mother had been screaming her name Her mother was relieved but everyone else was confusedWhen the mother freaked out about losing her daughter everyone assumed that it was a little kid rather than for all legal purposes an adult In all likelihood the daughter was about to go to college and spend months away from the mother but the mother was freaking out because the girl was gone for literally less than two minutes in a high end store in a nice town I was impressed with the professionalism simply for not questioning the age of the girl I couldnt believe the reaction of the mother,Woman freaks out when she loses her daughter,1239

RedRing,87,284,1pq91s,993,Hello again TFR  Yesterday I posted about the one day I completely lost my cool and went super saiyan  Wall of text in comingBackground again just in case  I worked at a game reselling store that was connected to a movie rental place  It was one of and will probably be the best job I had  Started there on my th birthday had to be  and was basically and for a short time was managing it on and off Alright so at my store I had tons of regulars and got to know them pretty well  Some of them became a family away from my actual and my work family  Even today some  years later I still see them and we talk like we saw each other just yesterday  There was one customer named jason who came in often with his grandma  He never bought anything and was just happy looking  If he did ask to buy something his grandma said it would be too hard for him  He would talk to me from time to time and tell me about his sonic game and how he loved to play it but had beat it numerous time sonic  on genesis  I always thought if he could play that then surely anything he looked at on ps was going to be just fine  One day his grandma pulls me to the side Gma We come in here a lot and jason has decided to call you a friendMe Thats good  Hes a really good kid and I enjoy him coming inGma I notice you never asked why we never buy anything and I respect that  Jason has autism so the games are just to hard for him to learn the controlsMe Oh I see  Well I wont say anything to him about it and you know you guys are always welcome in here and we will help as much as we canFast forward a couple of weeks on a monday afternoon where  we are usually dead as all get out  Day before game releases were very calm  I only needed one other person and they were already on the clock when in comes jason and his grandma  They look around and jason sees a game that he wants more than anything Ive ever seen him look at  Legend of spyro for the PS  His grandma told him it would be way to hard  The look on his face when she said that pulled on every heart string I hadI pulled his grandma to the side while he looked at the game and asked how long they thought they would be in the store  She said until she got tired and then they would go grocery shopping at the store at the end of our strip  So I ask if I can put the game into the demo unit  She was hesitant at first but decided to go ahead and let him  About an half hour into the game he is starting to get upset and she starts to get tired I put my office chair near her to sit down and start talking to jason and kinda walking him through how to play  Another hour goes by and he is getting the hang of it but she decides to go shopping  I convince her to let him stay and pick him up whenever she is done which she agrees to do  He is loving the game and I can see it  He has a look on his face Ive seen all to many times  While he is playing I tell my coworker to leave him alone and Ill be right back  I walk over to the grocery store and find her  I ask her if she has any problems with him getting the game  She says she doesnt really want to buy the game if he cant play it  I ask again and she gives the same answer so I tell her not to worry about that Ill take care of it  She agrees although hesitantlyI go back to the store and look up the barcode for the memory card he is using and the one for his game and ring them up  Use my extra store credit from my old non employee account I never was bothered to put on a gift card and finalize everything  She comes in and he gets really sad that he has to end the game  I go to turn it off and when I do I eject the game take the memory card out and put them together in the case with the receipt  He doesnt understand at first and starts to put the game back on the case so I go out from around the counter and tell him to open the game case  In that second I see the happiest expression I have ever seen  He runs to his grandma who is now visibly choked up about it and shows her  She is speechless but manages to say Thats amazing jason  He walks over to me and says Thank you redring I will beat this game just like you showed me  He then gave me a hug which made his grandma and I break out into tears  She takes him out of the store and they left  Later that night I get a call from her saying he has been playing the game all night  hours if I recall and is loving it  I explain how happy I am and tell her if it gets to be too much to bring the game in and we can switch it out or I can show him how to progress through that part   About  weeks later he came in and bought the second game and apparently had been doing extra chores to be able to buy it  I see them every now and then  Jason has been doing a lot better in school lately and is still gaming  Gaming has allowed him to make connections and friendship with people  He always is happy to see me and always gives me a high five and sometimes still a hug  This kid is honestly the best thing to come out of retail for me so far and I am so happy to have worked that day with him  To watch him go from the  year old who couldnt really play any games to a kid who is now understanding just about any game you put in front of him  To see how that experience made something where he could relate learning with his autism and make it basically non existent now  Every year I get a Christmas card from his grandmother and him and every time I am told what game his is playing and its always got something about spyro on it even if its just the picture of spyro sitting on their fireplace  They go in my bank lock box so that nothing happens to themTLDR I hate to do this for this one because it means so much to me  I help a kid and he changes my life,One of the best days Ive ever had,1277

TiredRightNowALot,61,227,1hv7bp,967,Okay so not quite as the title reads but heres a story from the archivesI was running a computer store at the time and once a week there was a meeting of the managers where we discussed changes to the business things to watch out for in the store etc  During this meeting I had invited a few extra people in I like to bring in associates from all levels of the business so they can see the managers arent plotting to fire people or other bad thingsSo in this meeting we were tight on space so I moved to the entrance of the room and was leaning against my desk probably sitting on it I dont remember that   We were talking for probably  minutes in total when I heard someone getting upset with one of my computer technicians  I probably had the best team of technicians in the city for their knowledge customer service and even pricing  I hear this lady getting quite rude and to the point of yelling so I excuse myself from the meeting and go out  I dont believe my staff should get yelled at I get paid for that part of the job though so here I goI come over to the customer and introduce myself shake her hand and ask her what I can do to help  She calms down but then points at my technician and tells me that HE BROKE MY LAPTOP  Okay well tell me about how that happened and I will see what I can do  She proceeds to tell me that the laptop was brought in just to be cleaned and now theres no information on it  Everything was erased all her pictures all her work everything  I agree that this is terribly frustrating and that I would have to do a little investigating to see what happenedI turn in front of her and ask my technician what was up  He explained that the lady brought the laptop in with a malfunctioning hard drive you know the type bad sector read arm scratching the surface  The drive was unrecoverable but he went ahead and searched for her receipt found that she was still under warranty and then phoned her  He explained what had happened but since she was under warranty he could replace the drive with one we had from a previous job and she would be fixed next day typically we order drives in from the manufacturer so that they actually pay for the parts and the job  In this case we didnt get paid because we used one that was considered our stock and also the manufacturer may or may not even reimburse us for labour for this tooI turn back to the customer and explain that we definitely didnt break the drive unfortunately the drive was dead on arrival and there would be no way for us to have ever saved her data  The only option she would have for that would be to send it to a data recovery lab pay around  and they MIGHT be able to retrieve it  I also was able to explain that we did do some things outside of normal policy to speed up the repair which meant that we straight up lost money to help her out but thought we would get her up and running much faster than normalWell the lady proceeds to lose her shit and accuses us of stealing her hard drive and data even though she agreed that she could hear the ticking noise of the hard drive before  I spent another  minutes or so trying to reason with her showing her that her laptop worked now and even giving her the old hard drive back so she felt more comfortable that we didnt steal her data  She said she got it she understood the situation and leftA couple of days later we had a complaint in the store against me  Basically that I didnt even try to help her I didnt show her any respect and we were the worst store in the city  I got the complaint of course since it was my store and I closed it off  I record the solution for all of these things and basically just left this one at customer will never be satisfied we did a good job  I made sure to come back and tell the tech that he did an awesome job helping this lady and to continue to be creative in how he solved issues customer firstFast forward two years  Lady comes back in to the store she was a semiregular customer even after the incident and asks for the store manager  I come up to the front of the store and say hello I recognize her and she doesnt recognize me  She proceeds to complain about a monitor that stopped working last night  I take it over and hook it up to a test computer and it works fine  I let her know and let her see it  I explain that her video card may be having an issue or something else  This was her home desktop so I ask her to bring it in which of course she refuses  I do have people certified background checks etc to go to customers homes and do work so I send someone over to check it out  Video card is dead  She comes in buys another and we go and install itNext day she comes back to the store and asks for me again  I walk up shake her hand once again and ask what I can do to help her out  She wanted to say thank you  She appreciated that I found a way to help her and she was happy for that  At the end she let me know this  You are very lucky that you did what you did  The last manager here lost his job because of me  He stole my hard drive and I phoned the owner and then he got fired  He was such a terrible manager and when I was having problems he just sat in that little room over there staring at me and laughingI laughed a little and said Well I guess today is my lucky day and then I thanked her and walked away  She continued to shop in my store up until I left  probably still does now  She always made a point to say hi and I always just had to bite my tongue because I wanted to let her know so bad that she was nutsTLDR Lady had some crazy complaint yelled a little  Couple years later same lady had a complaint that I fixed again and she told me that she had me fired two years prior  Just didnt know it was me,She got me fired Long Post,1194

Bravesfan,132,239,1mfvw6,963,My latest story can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsmoxsweetlittleoldladiesarethebestcustomersHey everybody Ive posted over here twice and got quite some good feedback and Ive decided that I would post about finally being able to kick my exboss out of the new storeHere are my old stories about my boss If you havent read them you may want to read them to get some background stories from my old bosshttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentslsrquthebosstoendallbossesMy boss doesnt like service dogshttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsmdzhimybossandserviceanimalsSo after leaving my job with my horrible boss of almost a year I found a job in the other grocery store across town This new store that I worked at was a discount grocery store which basically means that we would get overstock from other stores stuff that didnt sell outdated items not insanely outdated we still had some standards on the food we could sell etc etcAnyways we would still order regular stuff from the vendors and since we would usually buy some of their overstock and outdated stuff as well we would get a little bit of a better deal on whatever else we bought Getting a better deal meant that we could pass on some of the savings to the customerMy old boss would occasionally send some of the managers from the other store in to scope out our prices so that they could see if they could beat it and sell more than we could Normally my new boss Ralph wouldnt mind he would always just let it go Eventually he started to get a little upset about it and told me to ask them to kindly leave I had been hoping for this every since they started coming in and scoping prices so I went out to  of our assistant managers Paul and Larry and I kindly asked them to leaveBefore I move on heres a little background on the two grocery stores I worked atThe first one AKA the one with the horrible boss was a chain store therefore anybody below a manager really had no power whatsoeverThe new one AKA the one with the better boss was only three stores and the owner of the stores wouldnt really take much crap from others so we had quite a bit more power than I used to haveAnyways they inform me that Im not allowed to tell them to leave since Im not a manager and that anybody can shop in there I laugh and tell them that my manager had told me to ask them to leave and that if they didnt I would call the police to have them escorted out of the building They leave without more incident Im happy since these  along with Mike made my life hell for the past year I go about my job warehouse attendant and start running the forklift and trying to rearrange the warehouseI get called up front to go carry out some groceries for an older lady and as I walk back in who else would show up Its lovely old Mike He asks me why I kicked out his two managers and I informed him that if they wanted to come actually shop here they were at perfect liberty to do that but if all they were going to do was scope out prices so they could beat it then they were not allowed back in the store And if he was going to cause trouble he can not even enter the storeI turn my back on him walk back in and tell our checkers to call me if Mike comes in and starts trouble I go to the back and not even  seconds later I get a call from my checkers telling me that hes scoping out prices as well and that my boss Ralph was gone and they wanted me to take care of itI walk out from the back see Mike write down some prices from something and approach himMe Mike if youre going to be scoping out prices you can leave now tooMike Youre not a manager I dont have to listen to you and you cant even kick me out anywaysMe My boss gave me permission to kick out anybody from Old store name here if theyre just going to come here and scope out prices I can tell thats what youre doing so you need to leaveMike Id like to see you make meMe Ill give you about  seconds to start walking to the door and if you dont Ill call the police to escort you out  seconds go by where we just glare at each other with as much contempt as we can manageI pull out my phone and call the nonemergency line for our local police departmentPD This is City name police department nonemergency line how may we help youMe Hi this is Bravesfan Im

store name in a while I was wondering where you were Anyways its a small town who is it Maybe we can just talk to them on the phone to get them to leaveMe Its Mike from old store name OSN and hes scoping out our prices my boss has given me permission to kick anybody out from that store who is just coming over to scope out prices and thats all hes doing so we would like him removedPD Yeah Normally for something like this I would just ask the person to leave from the phone but Mike was being an ass to my wife the other day Im on my way minutes pass by where I help out a few customers while Mike scopes out more prices Police show up the cashiers tell him where Im at and we walk over to MikePD Mike youve been asked to leave You need to leave Technically youre trespassingMike This is a free country I can go where I pleasePD Unfortunately youve been told that youre not allowed on these premises therefore no you cant go where you like Leave or Ill escort you out with handcuffsMike Do you think you intimidate me Officer JonesTo clarify Mike is between  and  lbs cm kg while our officer is roughly  and  lbs cm and kgPD Mike Im going to ask you once more and then if you dont leave

look he can come up with and leavesWe both crack up laughing and the cop ends up giving me his direct number Neither of us like Mike and he wants to be the one to deal with him if anything should arise againIm sorry for all of these stories being so long I remember quite a bit of detail from them and I dont believe that I would be doing these stories any justice if I were to leave anything

JacOfAllTrades,49,197,189d22,961,This is a tale of the sixtysomethings Let me explain for some reason in about  of women when they hit the age of sixty they decide they are the endallbeall of interior decorators and if you say a word about it they will slice you down faster than a fat kid with a katana will take out a straw mat Thems some bitches And now the taleWe had in the store shopping two sixty something women Cranky Bitch and Momma Timid as well as the husband of one of the women Papa Timid Now Momma Timid had picked out a vase she liked as well as some branches so Papa Timid took them to the cash and asked me to check him out I rang him up bagged everything and he smiled brightly looked to his wife and said I got them for you Now you can decorate the livingroom Cranky bitch snapped her head around and hissed We arent finishedThis is when I knew this would not go well But nonetheless smile and be helpful ja Well Cranky Bitchs idea of design is make it all match All ALL ALL Needless to say we were not going to see eye to eye Cranky Bitch would make a recommendation then Momma Timid would look to me and ask What do you think The vast majority of the time I said basically Well eclectic is going to be better than matching because that way if anything fades or you decide to add something it wont be obviousCranky Bitchs usual reply to me stating my opinion Well what do you even know about itUm quite a bit I completed two years of interior design school what did you do Nothing I do this on a daily basis to the tune of thousands of dollars What do you do Decide youre right and yell at peoplePapa Timid I suppose feeling sympathetic whispered in my ear Just go stand behind the counter Well buy stuff then return it when Cranky Bitch leaves and have you help us for real While I would much prefer a world where people have spines this is fair enough so I went back to the cash to wait for a final purchase Cranky Bitch proceeds to stack  orange candles  orange vases  orange flowers and  orange pillow covers on the counter She thoroughly examines the candles and notes tiny dents and dings and differences between them and exclaims they simply will not do The candles are handcarved and painted theyre going to be imperfectCB You just have an excuse for everything dont youMe No maam Im stating fact If you dont like them dont buy themCB Whatever Hold this up pointing to a pillow cover so we can see itseriously It sitting right next to the things you want to compare it to isnt good enough Fine I held it up about chest levelCB No Up Up Like this she demonstrated by holding her hands at the sides of her headMe Im not doing thatCB Your job is to help me and do what I sayMe No maam I am not holding a pillow cover over my face Its a loss prevention issue and Im not going to degrade myself for youCB You need to shut up and do what I tell you to doMe No I dontNow here is where I should point a few things out There were only three of us running the store the GM me and a baselevel stock worker Ideally that would mean me covering the door at the front of the store the GM covering the door at the back of the store and Stock working stock obviously BUT our large furniture storage is in the basement of the mall and baselevel stock workers dont have a security code to access it We had a customer show up to pick up his table and chairs so the GM left me his manager keys and went down stairs to load the furniture leaving me at the front of the store and Stock at the back of the store Stock has worked for us for two weeks and has no idea how to run a register he was standing there for LP reasons only and was to send any customers up to me And this is why all of that mattersCB You will do what I say or I wont buy anything from youMe I wont be selling you anything todayCB Excuse meMe I refuse to help you Youre welcome to wait for another cashier but I will not be helping youCB Ill tell your managerMe Please do Hell come up here the second he gets back in the store this is true I had his keysCB You cant refuse to help meMe I can And I did Were done talkingShe tried screaming a variety of theoretically insulting things at me ie You think youre smart Nobody likes people who are obstinate etc then tried to get Stock to ring her out Stock of course told her I was the only cashier and he couldnt help her He informed her that the GM would be back at some point and hed send him over Meanwhile I checked out other customers which only enraged CB more and more I welcomed her to sit on a sofa and wait for the GM but that I was not going to help her Allinall she waited  minutes for the GM to come back and ring her out She told the GM I was crazy and cussed at them called her names blah blah blah He didnt speak until he handed her the receipt and said None of that is true Now dont come back to my store until you can treat my employees like people Her jaw hit the floor I swear Papa Timid giggled and Mama Timid fought a smileTrue to his word Papa Timid returned about  hours later and returned everything CB had picked out Mama Timid came in about ten minutes later and I helped them pick out pieces that would liven up their living room and kitchen for spring I did ask though how they would explain to CB what happened to the things she picked outMT Oh thats easy I have her dog at my house so Ill just say he destroyed everything and ask her to pay for itI kept my composure but I was dying with laughter on the insideTLDR Dont be a CB,Im not holding that over my face,1158
onlymrfstr,38,227,1k3r1y,958,I made my first TFR post yesterday and it went over quite well though I fully blame my side tangent rather than the main topic lol so I thought I would share this story  It comes from my fast food days long ago firstjob kind of stuff  The first job I had which I stayed at much much too long  So I started working for a burger place one of the wellknown international places not the top dog but youve definitely heard of this place  Anyway after a couple years I was an assistant manager so of course when problems arose I got to deal with it    I can honestly not remember what year this happened what time of year any of that best I can say is mids say  just for good measure  It hadnt been a terribly slow night nor busy just your average night slapping together processed beef patties and fake cheese  It was a bit later in the evening around pm  We had the tail end of a rush when a rather large order came through  I believe it had come through the drive through  Easily  different meals really who goes through the drivethru for that much food people who never worked fast food thats who  Of course each and every meal was to be made different with cheese without cheese no pickles extra onions you get the gist of it  OF COURSE  flash forward about  minutes and the phone rings  cue up the irate customer DriveThru Guy DTG lets call him  Well he starts yelling and screaming and saying we made everything wrong  I remember listening on the headset how he ordered and helped make the food  We didnt get it wrong from how he ordered it  Not one bit guaranteed  Regardless he says everything is wrong and starts laying demands on me  The people at my office work hard and are pulling an allnighter  We cant be bothered by this incompetence  around this time he starts telling me where I can deliver the remade order  Um yeah besides not having the technology to deliver we can get in serious trouble for that  I make up something like its against the store insurance policy to allow employees offsite while on the clock it may be true may have heard it and blurted it out or just something I pulled out my ass  Amazingly he accepts thisLook DTG heres what Im willing to do for you  You come on back down I will have your entire order remade and ready for you when you get here  He tells me the entire order again we go over each meal to make sure we are on the same page  Me and my kitchen guy work on the food and as its just about done I hear a banging on our lobby door  Our dining room has closed at pm so just drivethru was open  I know this is pretty common practice now but back then we were one of the first stores in my area to do it after an attempted robbery  I go up to the door and tell the guy the lobby is closed he says hes DTG so I go ahead and let him in  Yeah I could have gotten in trouble if the owner drove by or whatever but the guy had a huge order and seemed pretty pissy so I was going to try to appease him as best I could within my control  He comes in I let him know we are bagging up the last of his order  Amazingly he brought the messed up food and left it with us  He was still acting kind of dickish but I did my best to be as nice and professional as possible  If he was going to undoubtedly complain he couldnt say one word about our customer service being rude  So food is packed up Ive read every item looked to show it was marked to have been made exactly as I wrote down and compared notes with his so that we knew each and every meal was right He says all of them look right so it gets all packed again  Right before he picks up his bags I hand him a few coupons for free meals and apologize for the inconvenience and offer my hand to shake  Now DTG had an attitude the entire time practically sneered and probably just expected the worst out of some punk fast food kid but what I just did flabbergasted him  He looks to the coupons looks to me shakes my hand and thanks me the first time in our dealings I felt he wasnt completely looking down on me  I let him out the door and send him on his wayfast forward a few weeks and someone at the drivethru window asks for me by name  I go up and who is it but DTG  He thanks me again for the service I had given him that night and even apologized for the way he acted  Over the course of the next few years I saw him at least once a week and most times he would ask for me just to say hi  At one point he gave me his business card and said if I had any interest in a different career to give him a call  I forget what that was but I remember it seemed terribly uninteresting or just not what I wanted to do so I never did call After a couple years of him coming by weekly he asks for me by name in drive thru one last time and says that his company transferred him that he was moving out of town and he thanked me one last time for the service I provided him with and shook my hand  tldr life handed me lemons I made lemonadeEDIT  my nd TFR post and it makes it to the front page as well  thank you  Wish I could say I have a ton more Im sure some will come flooding back ,how I made a regular customer out of a complete jackass,1185

Minja,79,255,1nsjeo,909,This from back in my gamestore days  I had just taken over a new store in less than desirable location  As this wasnt the first time I had been moved stores I demanded an inventory for my first Sunday there The employees were none to happy as they just had an Inventory a few weeks ago and most inventories ran  hours past close A couple days past inventory I got my results  We were short about  used GBA game boy advance and GBC Game boy Color games Now my first assumption is I missed a drawer of over stock because the list didnt include that many games just bulk quantities of them Tons of research later I found we really were missing ish games right about   This discovery immediately removed our store from any employee perks such as no employee discount and the only reason to work a Gamestore the  day video game check outOnce I informed the staff no one cared as the only time they  had employee perks was when I first started there a week ago They all blew it off as the store being in a high theft area and outside of a security guard there was nothing that could be done They were all clueless as to what was missing and their unified nonchalance to the situation caused me to keep my facts close to heart  All the used Gameboy games were under glass and locked up so I surmised this was an internal thing The Plan  I had a copy of GBC Pokemon with a captured Mew in it Stoopid rare at the time as Mew was only in promo copies of the games We implemented a store policy which would give people more trade in credit if they had a Mew copy  Well I went on my days off for the week and I had my brother different last names trade in my game I had placed some special markings on the game and had intentions of buying it back when I got back to work  When I got back no one mentioned Mew being in the store which was odd cuz we had less rare games produce way more excitement Well I knew who traded it in and I kept the crews the same on my days off On to the internet I went ebay was huge back then so it was the first place I tried I didnt take long to find a mew edition being sold in my region Believe it or not ebay was less than helpful about supplying me this sellers real name  So I had a relative from  states over buy it and send it to me  Sure enough it was my copy I now had the sellers name and address  It was my fucking assistant manager I had trained this guy about  years back and got him promoted to assistant to this store  GRRRRRRRNow I had him dead to rights and maybe the one other supervisor since he traded the game in  HR and district didnt think this was enough to fire because I used shady means to discover this supposed theft I had been with the company for  years at that point and I was tired of bureaucratic nonsense that corporate was doing  This was my  store they moved me to so that I can fix the inventory problems and I was done So with out corp approval I called the cops  It took about two weeks for the detective to compile his case he got a search warrant for house and ebay account I made sure I was working with the perp when the popos showed up I had an employee from the another store waiting in the coffee shop next door ready to work when shit went down  It was pretty fn amazing I called my district manager as the perp was being arrested she wasnt very happy with me  He broke almost immediately and the search warrant pulled out about  games totaling about k  The next day I was fired for unprofessional conduct is what the termination papers said Im not sure what happened to the thief or his supposed accomplices legally  I know the store was gutted of employees about a week after I got fired I went to court once about the theft case it was in a conference room and I sat in front of ish people who all asked me a bunch of questions After about  minutes they figured out I didnt work there anymore and promptly stopped asking me questions Unemployment sided with me after it went to court The judge all but laughed at the district team for firing me I got about a half a years pay since it took so damn long for me to my UE approved ,Internal theft Got me fired,1164

DrunkenBlackBelt,128,231,1aqyy8,897,Hey all So just a quick story for you all Changing jobs so probably wont be posting as much anymore since I tend to stay off the computer when Im not working  But anyways heres a quick story for youSo about two years ago I went with a friend on vacation It was right after I had quit DampB and was enjoying my first vacation since HS  On one of our last nights there my friend decided she wanted to surprise surprise go shopping at the outlet stores in the area  Fine I could always buy a few thingsSo while shes out looking at shoes and handbags and shit I wander over to the ATHLETIC APPAREL   store Sorry that was the best analogy I could come up with  I wanted to get a few golf shirts and some rash guards  compression shirts for BJJ  I pick out a few shirts and head over to the fitting room  As Im changing I hear the door to the tall next to me swing open and some general rustling noises  Ok no big deal Thats when I heard an all too familiar sound Snip Snip  Well any LP worth his weight in Reddit Gold knows that is the sound of someone cutting the sensors off of an item  Sure enough a few seconds later a cut tag falls on the floor and lads between the stalls  A foot reaches out and kicks it back underneath the bench in their stall  So I put my shirt back on having tried on the last shirt I had selected and walk up to the register The two associates are sitting there a male and a female The female is helping a customer so I walked over to the male who we shall refer to as Dumbass DBB Hey man I work LP for another company Im on vacation but whoever was in the stall next to me is stealing shit from youNow I have never seen a black man blush before but this guy did it  He suddenly looks extremely uncomfortable looks at his co worker and back to me and simply says Ok  DBB Hey man I dont know your stores policies nor do I want to tell you to do your job Im just letting you know because they are using something to snip the tags so if you guys do do something just be carefulAt this point the female who turns out to be the manager is finished with her customer and asks what the issue is  We will call her Belle because she was a true Southern Belle And Im original like thatDumbass goes to open his mouth but I cut him off and repeat that Im an LP agent and heard someone snipping tags off of the clothes in the dressing stallsBelle Well what are you standing around for Go approach them DumbassDumbass UmmmWellWell Belle doesnt miss a beat She marches over to the stalls and starts banging on the doors saying You need to drop your shit and come out right now Get out here now  Dumbass walks over and looks horrified  I walk over too in case this person decides to take the scissors multitool or whatever it is they are using and use it as a weapon  Frantic rustling is heard and suddenly a bunch of shirts drop on the ground The door opens up and out walks a young male we will call Dumbass   Now Im tense because I dont know whats about to happen  Guts get cold body tightens up  As comedian Bert Kreischer describes it Its that moment in customs when your asshole gets cold because they just found the hash on you  And it gets awkward quick  DA is starting at DA and DA is staring at the floor  Belles mouth is wide open in shock and is starting between DA and  It suddenly feels awkward More awkward than farting at a funeral Keep in mind that the other shoppers are staring at us after Belle made a racketBelle Dumbass  You MOTHER FUCKER  Turns to DA YOUR BROTHER ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME  YOU TOLD ME HE NEEDED TO HANG AROUND BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS WERENT HOME SO I WAS NICE AND LET HIM HANG AROUND AND YOUVE BEEN STEALING FROM ME Oh god it was amazing The look of pure hatred on her face The look of shock on theirs  The look of amazement on the other shoppers faces It was like Christmas and Hannukah and Kwanzaa wrapped up into one glorious moment  This was me the whole timehttpmediatumblrcomtumblrmkuqDmTqemjogifBelle turned out to be a smart cookie and didnt let her anger get the best of herBelle Well you didnt leave the store with these so I cant charge you And until I go through all the security tapes I cant prove you took anything else  But I think you two should leave And dont bother coming back unless you come back with whatever youve taken or the cash equivalentDA What about my paycheckBelle  I think we can find a nice charitySo the Super Dumbass Bros give one last hateful glance at me and leave the store  Belle takes a few moments apologizes to the customers and walks me back to the counter She thanks me profusely and tells me shell give me a  credit  So I basically got two golf shirts and two rash guards for free  I tell her Im sorry and she says its not a big deal and that she should have known Shrink jumped the moment that kid started working there and she just ignored it  We said our goodbyes and I walked out with a few shirts and

DeaditeQueen,63,206,1ma3ny,885,Most of my clinic posts have had to do with ignorant nasty or just plain stupid clients I wanted to share this short one because it was one of the most selfless moments of true love that I had the pleasure to be part ofThere was a long time client and her Boxer mix Cinder Cinder had been recently diagnosed with a seizure disorder and just like with people it can take some time to find the right meds and dosages to keep the seizures under controlCinders owner was an upper middle class retiree She was polite friendly and had a natural charm just like her baby Cinder She was always well dressed and kept her hair and makeup age appropriate yet still very fashionable She was a staff favI grabbed the phone one late afternoon and it was Cinders owner all in a fluster She was on her way because Cinder was experiencing the worst seizure she had ever seen her have Again just like with people extended seizures can lean to a myriad of neurological issues She had administered Phenobarbitol but it had done nothing and she was in dire fear for Cinders lifeI alerted the staff that we had an emergency coming in grabbed Cinders chart and before we could grab a litter to bring Cinder in with she came flying into the parking lot Now she was a heavy set and short woman Cinder was a fairly large Boxer mix Before I had a chance to hit the door she was wobbling across the lot with Cinder still seizing furiously in her arms I raced out to take the dog from her but before I could reach her she fell and the cracking noise that followed wrenched my gut She had not only broken her ankle in the fall but the bone was exposedI screamed for my coworkers to call an ambulance and Cinders mom looked up to me a shouted Dont worry about me Cinder Help CinderI scooped the dog up and hustled her to the awaiting vets who immediately began treatment I raced back out with another staffer to do what we could to make Cinders owner comfortable as she laid in boiling hot cement with an exposed ankle bone She only wanted to know about Cinder Would she be ok Had we gotten the seizing to stop It had only been several minutes so I couldnt answer her questions as much as I wished I couldThe ambulance arrived and whisked her off to the hospital She even used her cell to call from the ambulance She knew time was of the essence with the seizing and at that point we had stopped it but werent able to give her a prognosis yetShe had to have surgery on her ankle that kept her in the hospital for almost  weeks We kennels Cinder for her free of charge during this time By some miracle the effects of the prolonged seizure were minimal and the news elated her and drove  her hard to get thru physical therapy and heal upIn the midst of what must have been horrific physical pain she cared only for the well being of her beloved baby Her own health came second to the dog who loved her with everything she had It was such a selfless and pure act of love that I felt like I should share Cinders condition got under control so well that only a visit every few months was necessary and since her owner had to use a cane most of the time at that point Cinder showed amazing patience by keeping her own pace slow and relaxed She had once bounded and frolicked on her lead but it was as if she understood what happened that day and was paying her owner back with love and patienceThe bonds I witnessed thru the years all varied each one unique and beautiful I will never forget the look on this womans face when she pleaded that I leave her and help her dog In that moment I witnessed true loveEDIT I never imagined this would touch so many people and so deeply I just want to clarify that I am not a vet I worked at a clinic for many years with the unofficial title of JackofAllTrades I did everything from answering phones handling behavioral issues assisting in surgery and even performing very minor procedures Botfly removal cyst drainage etc by myself or with another techs assistance filling meds counseling grieving owners andwell you name it lol I did almost everything a vet does with the exception of getting the big bucks lol But I often said that I would have paid THEM to let me work there Best years of my life,A selfless owner More Tales from a Vet Clinic,1091

vaime,95,230,1psk4k,844,Background I work as a promotional model doing numerous different things but probably my favourite job is working at an airside Duty Free store in an international airport My job is to give out samples give the customers product info sell our product and help the customers with any other purchase they want to make Basically Im somewhere between one of the floor staff and the brand ambassadorsThe Story Where I live we have pretty strict alcohol laws which all promo models working with alcohol have to know and abide by One of these includes the requirement to check ID before offering free samples of anything with alcohol in it Im quite a stickler for this rule as I know the consequences for the store if were caught breaking it And seeing as the local police regularly wander around its not worth taking that risk The problem with this is checking ID is often a pain when the store is busy mainly because Im terrible at math and need to count the age of the customer out in my headIn order to get around this I dont offer samples to anyone who looks like they could be underage or around our legal age  But if someone comes up and asks for a sample thats fine I check ID Not a problem Most of the time I will only ask for ID if Im pretty sure theyre underage or theyre being a douchebag Either or But anyway I digressId been standing on the lease line the front of the store right where people walk past or into the shop serving a few customers when a group of basketball singlet baggy pants clad guys came past and started wolf whistling then walked off Not too long after one of the group returned  from here on Ill address him as NotSoBright or NSB for shortNSB nonchalantly walks past the shop a couple of meters away looking around I offer samples to a couple who have just walked in they politely decline NSB by now has reached the security point turns around and walks back  a little closer this time but still looking around looking nonchalant He continues walking past getting closer and closer each time but still looking around as if hes just going for a casual stroll before his flight I recognised the kid as one of the wolfwhistlers from before so ignored him offering samples to the other passengers walking by NSB keeps up his casual strolling getting closer and closer and eventually just staring at me trying to catch my eye in the hope that Ill offer him a drinkEventually NSB gives up trying to catch my attention and walks straight up to the promo barNSB Hey what have you got thereMe Hi there Today were sampling the different flavours of insert alcohol brand here NSB Oh hell yeah Free shots I want oneMe Awesome I just need to see your ID first if thats OKNSB doesnt answer just gives me a blank stare I figure he may not get it so I try to reiterateMe Im uh not allowed to give samples to anyone under the age of  so Ill have to check your ID NSB still with blank look Yeah Im over  So can I have oneMe I need to see your ID first I know it seems silly but  we have to make sure we arent giving alcohol to minorsNSB Nah its cool Im over  Im Me I still need to see ID sorry or I cant give you a sample The kid is still staring blankly at me  you can practically see the gears ticking over in his head trying to decide what to do nextNSB Ah yeah I forgot my ID sorry laughs I do this every damn time But its cool Im   Im not underageMe You forgot your IDNSB shrugs Yeah I mustve left it at homeIts now my turn to stare blankly at NSB At this point I will remind everyone that we are in Duty Free Duty Free in an Airport Airside Duty Free in an Airport The customs and security checkpoint is literally less an m to our left Im struggling to comprehend all the stupid thats going on right nowMe You dont have your IDNSB Yeah I just said I left it at home Me Your passport is fineNSB starting to get a bit irritated I just told you I left it at home Just give me the damn shot alreadyMe You dont have your passport on youNSB NOI really have no idea what to do One half of me is shocked at the sheer stupidity of this moron the other half is desperately trying not to laugh Me Then how may I ask did you manage to get through customs without a passport NSB loses all emotion on his face Im struggling to maintain my composure and not burst out laughing He literally just stands there silent for about  seconds Then turns and just walks away As soon as he turned I burst into fits of laughterId really love to know what was going through his head through that whole exchangeTLDR If youre going to try and pull the forgot my ID card when trying to get alcohol samples from promo staff make sure youre doing it in a place which doesnt require you to have your passport,Conveniently forgetting your ID may work on your local bottle store Sir but its a bit harder to pull off when youve just gone through customs at an airport  Tales from Duty Free,1074
Oakwater,196,216,1jqhxb,834,Hello all I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our companyMany moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day This sunday was no different in the store was myself the assistant manager and lets call her Kay Kay was an extremely large girl in her late teens she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single senseThe day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the    shift Kay had gone for her break at  because she couldnt last another minute without some food to keep her going This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at Anyway she rolled back to the shop floor  minutes too long from her break and I went for my lunch at  oclock As per my usual routine I went to the local supermarket to grab a sandwich and the manager had gone out back to do some paper work This left Kay to man the shop for the  minutes I would be goneAfter devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be Oh well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or somethingI walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for meThe displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barrenStrewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown its contents across the aisleShitI panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunchKay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock lossAmazinglyJust purely amazingly she wasnt immediately firedTLDR Lazy coworker desire to stuff face means she leaves the entire shop unmanned for nearly  minutes Thieves have a field dayEDIT For those asking on a follow up or more stories honestly Im sorry to say that the repercussions were not all that severe She managed to blag her way out of it somehow with a written warningHowever for some closure she was fired about a month later when our store manager caught her eating stolen crisps in the bathroom Im sorry for the dissapoint,A loss of s of pounds of stock because a staff member hadnt eaten in a few minutes,1050

AHenWeigh,49,241,1j2l9x,830,Edit since it appears to be unclear to some this is a funny story not a weird sexfetish story or a demoralizing terrible storyIm writing a story my GF just told me as she dictatesThis was a couple years ago and I was working as a cashier at a local frozen yogurt shop A married couple comes in with a male friend The couple gets up to the scale register first and pay together The husband is pointing back at his friend saying look at that fatass piling all those butterfingers on his yogurt  what a fatass Then he says to me as Im ringing them up Ill give you ten bucks if you call him a fatass To which I replied I dont think I can really do that He insisted Just do it just do it and they moved past as their friend came up to the register What were they saying about meSir they really want me to call you a fatass They said theyd give me He laughs and says Heck Ill give you  for calling me thatAnd thats how I got  put in the tip jar with only  transactions ,Sir you are a fatass,1071
quinyd,117,248,1h6v0z,825,This is a kind of reverse retail I pay for peoples broken stuff aka i work in insurance as a claim handler This became way longer than I had expected but you can learn a trick or two about talking to your insurance companyFirst a little introductionThis story is from a few years ago when I worked for a big insurance company somewhere in Europe I was  at the time Because the company wanted to have happy customers and quickly expedite claims I rarely had to ask my supervisor for payment approval which was nice If I deemed it fair I could pay  without asking my supervisor If I needed to pay between  and  I had to mention it to my supervisor and above  I needed approval This was nice because my employer trusted me and my coworkers with a lot of money and  of the time they would support our decision It was overall an awesome place to workOne thing I learned pretty quickly was that people tend to overstate things worth and tried to get more money from me because they think I dont know what things are worth Sometimes people got angry because Im too young to know how valuable their stuff isNow to the storyIn this case a customer calls and tell me his Mac is broken Im immediately alert because   I know my Macs both older and newer and know what they are worth  People ALWAYS assume their Mac is at least worth twice as much as it is I start out by smalltalking with the guy Im always starting out with this since I want to get information about the computer without directly asking People tend to understate age and use or wear and overstate price when asking directly To avoid this Im trying to be friendly and make him tell me the details without asking This might seem cruel but I have to get him to tell me the truthSo his Mac has water damage this is understandable since there was a big flood the week before and I accept the damage claim The computer is about  years old so I look it uphttpenwikipediaorgwikiListofMacintoshmodelsbycasetype while continuing to talk to him Since it is a desktop I assume this is an Aluminum iMac Core  I ask him what model it is and he says it is a G Here I stop him and ask how he can have a  year old G Power MachttpenwikipediaorgwikiPowerMacG He confesses that he bought  years ago which I tell him makes it at least  years old possible  years old At this time Im already thinking that he wont get much for his computer He tells me it is worth  and that he would like the money ASAP When people tell me they want money ASAP alarm bells goes off and I slow down a bit His G is definitely not worth  and I offer him a replacement G which I can get for him on craigslistlikesite This is normal practice I can try and replace the broken object or give him cash Most people chose cash understandable I also explain that if he wants cash I can only give him  This I explain is based on the age of the computer which I set at  years and the original price With an estimated original price of  I can subtract  because it is electronic and over  years old meaning I can give him  But he also have a selfrisk of  that he has to pay every time he has a damage claim He is of course not happy If you lost your fine working computer and was offered  you wouldnt be happy too But you have to understand that I can only give compensation for actual hardware not sentimental value I try and explain that I cant do anything else for him and that I suggest he take the offer of a replacement computer which I will arrange to have shipped directly to his door He then goes on and explain to me that he need it right now and that he would like to go buy one ASAP because he cant work without it I become alert by this statement because if it is a work PC then I cant give him anything at all since it is a personal insurance and not company insuranceI directly ask him even though I could already now reject the claim on the basis that it is a work computer if he uses it for work and what kind of work he does He denies it is for his job and says personal work in general I accept this because Im a nice person He again tries to convince me it is worth a lot more and I tell him the price reduction and that I know my fair share of Macs which basically means he wont have any luck with me He sounds pretty bumped out and most of my coworkers would probably have giving him a bit more since they arent familiar with Macs He is not happy at all and puts his mom on SURPRISE I had to mute the phone and say WTF to my coworker next to me I can see that he is in his thirties and I cannot understand how he believes that his mother can convince me to pay moreShe starts to complain and tell me that his son cant work without his computer Again I ask what kind of work he does on this computer and I hear the guy in the background tell her that he doesnt use it for workI laugh to myself and tell her the same as I told him He comes back on and I tell him he can talk to my supervisor who will offer him the same deal Since I offer for him to talk to my supervisor I seem like the big guy and he believes me My supervisor who has no idea about Macs would trust my judgment and tell him the sameHe reluctantly accepts and I transfer the  to his bank account ASAPI tell the story to my supervisor who laughs and say it is good to have young people who knows about electronicsJust another day at the officeI have a lot more stories from my days in insurance if this one is well received I will post moretldr  why are you here if you dont like long stories,My  year old mac is worth k,1073

toxlab,137,205,1h24vl,826,Time for another one of my rambling goofy stories As usual there will be a TLDR at the bottom Strap inRight after high school I took a break from restaurant work to go into the then very new field of video rental I worked for Blockbuster for a while helping new stores get set up and staffed After about a year of this a local company trying to compete was opening up new stores near existing Buster locations They were cherry picking employees for the management of these new stores I was offered a ridiculous salary and quite a bit of authority The new company was just a reskinned Blockbuster same product same pricing just different colors There was one thing a little different thoughPornThis was in Cincinnati Ohio A very conservative city If youve ever seen the film The People VS Larry Flynt the man who prosecuted Flynt for obscenity Simon Leis was now the sheriff And he still had a hard on for smut It was illegal to sell Playboy no adult films could be had and his group of obscenity watchdogs patrolled business looking for filth Blockbuster immediately rolled over and showed their cute family friendly bellies They never carried porn they refused to stock titles with the new NC  rating and anything that was disliked was pulled off the shelves They got rid of Last Temptation of Christ because of the letter writing campaign this group staged Terroristic threats of arson and vandalism were the norm This new store showed some balls They carried NC  and while they didnt have hardcore porn they did have a section called Private Screenings It was mostly softcore offerings like Emmanuel and Best Chest In The West It was all stuff you could find in any R rated movie But the titles were sometimes a little salacious and people would see the tapes shelved spine out instead of flat so no one could see the covers and wig out Once or twice a week someone would come in and blow steam about us being smut peddlers I would ask for their card and cut it up wishing them the best in their future rental endeavors At first I was amused by the steady stream of customers these tapes brought in It was squeaky clean smut something you could get your hands on locally Customers would be waiting in the lot when I turned up to open When I would unlock the doors theyd get their lite porn cash out and bolt As if there were some masturbation emergency going on One guy would rent three come back four hours later and get three more He did this four days a week for my entire time there Occasionally people would forget about returning their porn Nothing was more enjoyable than the daily calls of shame I would retire to the office with my list and start dialing Me Hello Is Mr X thereHer This is Mrs XMe Hi this is toxlab from NotBuster Video Im calling about an overdue tape on your accountHer We havent been in there in weeks We dont have any moviesMe Well someone on your account rented Prison Island Bitches on Friday nightHerin the background a tiny fire bursts into an inferno OH ILL MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT RIGHT AWAYIm shelving tapes one day and notice that we have a copy of Caligula on the private screenings shelf If youve never heard of it its a film starring Malcom MacDowell and other respected actors Its about the mad Roman emperor and his wild orgies and other bizarre behavior After it was filmed producer Bob Guccione of Penthouse fame decided that what the film needed was more dong So he shot huge epic hard core orgy scenes He essentially inserted well known actors into a porno flick This did not go over well in hollywood I take it home As soon as it starts I realize its the hardcore cut of the film Distributing this in our city will get you jail time When I return it I leave it in the office The next day I start looking for other titles that might not make the cut I inform my employers Some movies are easy to rule out just by the distribution titles Others not so easy We had a copy of Party at Kitty and Studs the porno movie featuring a young Sylvester Stallone The movie was softcore but the trailers before it were hard There are a few dozen titles that I find doubtful What should we doThe district manager doesnt want to shut the section down Complaints aside the tiny section brings in a LOT of revenue And usually people grab a couple new releases before they say Hey as long as Im here Ill grab No Muff Too Tough How do we solve this problem The solution is that we must screen EVERY LAST ONE of these tapes We dont have to take notes as the plot develops just put it on fast forward and be on the lookout for arcing ropes of jism This duty falls to me The manager above me was a  year old virgin He was scandalized when the DM suggested he do it He had never seen a dirty movie and didnt know where the lines were drawn He was an innocent soul He also had a shrine to The Little Mermaid in his house but thats neither here nor thereEvery night I would fill my book bag with tapes to check TV on Sound off One good pile one bad pile Away we goAsking an  year old to look for porn is a good idea You have a preternatural sense about boobies You are always happy to see em and youre always ready for more On occasion the fast forwarded drama would prove too intriguing and I had to return to regular speed Wait a minute First she was in a classroom blowing a teacher and now shes in prison having a lesbian three way What happened here This continued for about a month I believe I found a total of twelve tapes that could get us in trouble We pitched them and continue on our merry wayOne afternoon a gentleman came in and discovered our naughty treasure trove He was affrontedHe How dare you corruption of youth jesus is weeping etc etcI I can assure you sir that every tape in that section meets community standards The covers may be a little vulgar but the contents merit no more than an R ratingHe HOW DO YOU KNOW HAVE YOU SEEN EVERY MOVIE IN THE STOREI Yessir I have Every one of themltI suddenly realize how this sounds and start to blushgtErm I had to For work I was checking them for work We had to make sure I am now sweatingI I HAD TO DO IT I DIDNT WANT TO WATCH THEM ALL ReallyIHe took his tapes and left Whenever I saw he or his wife after that I got the strangest looksTLDR year old me in prudest city in the country paid to watch pornThanks again to all the users for the kind words It is appreciated On a personal note I would like to collect my posts into one mega post full of links I have no idea how to do this Can anybody help,Its only porn if you touch yourself,1031

Gneissisnice,159,243,1qjhdd,809,I work in a college bookstore as you could probably guess from the title You might remember some other stories Ive posted herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentslmxvthecustomermetamorphosistheory herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsivmcanigetadiscount and herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbcziwantitnow Today I thought Id share the story of why I stopped answering the phone at work warning very longNow its November at the bookstore and things are pretty much dead Weve sent all of our books back to the publishers and cleared out the store so theres not much to do except tell the lazy procrastinators no we dont have that book yes Im sure why did you wait until November to buy your book So when the phone rang I was eager to have something to do Boy was I wrong about that University bookstore this is Gneiss speaking how may I help youHi I was wondering if you could pull up receipts for my daughters purchases since  WHAT No I cant do that I explain that for us to find it she would need the exact date and time for each purchase Not that we would even be able to pull up a transaction from three years ago anyway But then a thought occurs to meDid you maybe order them online I ask She says that yes she ordered everything online Ah thats a different story and doable But just because I can do it doesnt mean I should Why does she need receipts from  semestersI ask her why and she explains that her crazy exhusband refuses to pay for her daughters textbooks unless she can prove that she only spent money on books and not sweatshirts or other merchandiseOh Uh okay I guess that kinda makes sense in a way Ignoring the obvious questions like Why is your husband paying NOW  years later and He really wouldnt pay if your daughter did buy any logo merchandise I decide to send her the emailsI pull up her daughters book orders and tell her that they only go back to Fall  She asks why and I dont know but I guess that we either changed systems at that point or it just doesnt store the orders for more than a few years I mean how often would you need to pull up orders from that long ago Shes unhappy with that but we proceed She asks if I can cc her on the emails Nope I can only send them to her daughters email that the order was placed under and I tell her the email address to confirm that its correct Now that the orders have been fulfilled I cant change any of the information I do tell her that she can have her daughter forward her the emails though and she agrees to that As I start sending email after email I inform her that one of her purchases has the status of CancelledWhy she inquiresProbably because you cancelled the order I respond  emails and  minutes later were finally done She thanks me and thats thatOr is it Apparently not as it turns out A few hours pass and I hop on the front register as it gets somewhat busy Just as I get off the manager calls me over Gneiss phone for youPhone for ME Thats weird I pick it up Its Her Hey Gneiss you helped me out earlier I just had a couple of questions One my daughter didnt get all of the emails Whats going on I pull up her orders again and I immediately see the problem Your daughter changed her email the first few orders went to her old email I did say that the emails were going to that email Oh Cant you change the emailSigh No maam as I explained earlier we cannot change the email address You should have your daughter check her old email and see if its thereOk Well can you send them again SIGH Sure why not Its not like I have anything better to doOh and my other question Are you SURE that you cant pull up anything earlier than  I explain to her that yes Im sure Here come the dreaded words Can you check with your manager to make sure Ugh I put her on hold and go over to the assistant manager who usually deals with web orders I explain the situation and he thinks the entire thing is absurd but he agrees to check the womans order He asks for name and I tell herHis eyes widen HER and suddenly memories come flooding back to me The woman that kept me on the phone for an hour last semester asking me to go over the price of every book her daughter had rented The woman who calls once every couple of weeks with some kind of crisis The woman who is already famous in the bookstore for being a major pain in the ass Its HER Now the situation makes more sense He checks and tells me that we cant search for orders before  I go back to the phone and tell her She asks Who did you talk to Was it Jay I know Jay Let me speak to him Sorry Jay He grumbles as I pass him the phone leaving him to be stuck with Her for another  minutes But hey the situations out of my hands now and all is resolvedNope Two days pass and the phone rings again Hey remember me I called yesterday but you werent in so I decided to call again today I scream internally as I force myself to say Of course What can I help you with today Are you SURE I cant pull up orders from before  I once again explain that I am absolutely positive Oh ok Well I have another question I see that one of the orders was cancelled Thats not very good proof that I paid for the books I was wondering if you could remove that status from the orderNow Im dumbfounded No maam I cant do that You didnt actually pay anything for that order because you cancelled it and I cant change the statusHer Why notBecause that would be lying Besides the order was completed  years ago we cant change a finished orderOh ok Thats all I wanted to know thanksWell thats probably over now Its Thursday and Im not working again until Tuesday hopefully its all done now Even though Im off on Friday I come in because its the assistant managers last day and I baked her cookies Im the best employee I know As I come in the phone rings I joke Its probably her and a coworker gets it She grins looks at me and mouths Its Her She asked for you No Absolutely not Im not even working today My coworker takes the call comes back  minutes later and tells me She asked if we could pull up orders from before  I said no and she demanded to speak to a supervisorSo now when the phone rings at work I always ask for someone else to answer it and if it is Her tell her Im not thereTLDR Crazy customer called a thousand times asking the same question with increasingly more ridiculous requests asking for me each time,Her Tales from the College Bookstore,1052

toxlab,181,244,1gml24,804,Something reminded me of this tale of uncomfortable nonsense thought Id shareI was working at a very high end steak house as a cook The prices were high and most of the clientele very well behaved It was a premium joint the folks who made it past the sticker shock of the menu were often quite appreciative of our efforts We were providing cuisine not food The menu was very simple Four or five cuts of steak one chicken dish and live Maine lobster A few circus sized veggie portions and thats all We were very good at what we did I was on saute which meant I cooked the veggie sides the chicken and the lobsters The lobsters were HUGE I mean bigger than your head huge A fairly well known musician once described them as bigger than a puppy I think the smallest one I saw in a year of working there was four and a half poundsI had to dispatch these brutes No simple trip into boiling water for these guys You had to split them down the middle put the halves on a baking tray melted butter on the tails remove the pouch like stomach from the head cavity and add in heavy cream The tasty bugs would still be flailing their legs around as you set them in a broiler The cavities would release air as they died This meant you were sticking a screaming animal into a fire The tiny little aaaaaaah that came out was disconcerting Especially after you poured in the cream Imagine filling a screaming animals face with liquid You got aaaaaaaahgbgbgbb EVERY FREAKING TIMEBut like anything it comes easier with practice You stop flinching after a while Now this steak house doesnt have a printed menu Instead the have a cart that is rolled up to the table Well heeled servers describe each item even providing a provenance for your beef holding up  oz steak This meat was raised by XYZ in XYZ town for our exclusive stockyardsThe great reveal was the lobster After describing everything else They would swoop the five or six pound critter off its silver tray Lobsters do not enjoy being held They show this by opening and closing their tails toward their bodies Underwater this allows them to escape from predators On land this means they are slapping their tails against their bodies as you struggle to hold on A food critic once called it being threatened with a live animal It was certainly dramaticThe servers would call it back Whack a six This meant dispatch a six pounder I did this all night long Lobster blood is thick and grey and once it hit the cutting board or your jacket it turned into grey jello You are covered in slime putting a bisected arthropod into a firey furnace Whenever new hires were shown around the restaurant I would make sure to have a lively one ready for the knife Hey welcome Im toxlab I kill lobsters Like this guy here His name is Kenneth Hi Kenneth How are you Would you like some lemons and melted butter Sure I just have to do one thing first WHAM Knife through the carapace Split the tail Swing it around Whats that Not your head but what if I justWHAM Butter cream oven Hey look hes dancing in the broilerI would amuse myself with these little dialogues Especially when they got to the ten pound and up range Those suckers fought back I would pet them and make up back stories for these guys Whole telenovelas were acted out for the amusement of my cohorts One week we got the biggest lobster Id ever seen I was dying to whack him It would be like landing a marlin I made sure he was covered with wet newspapers to keep him feisty He wouldnt be an easy sell The price per pound put it almost into the thousands He would be a gourmet treat for four people or more The order finally came through Time to dispatch Big Daddy YES I ran to get him I cradled it with both arms My coworkers were amused They knew I had been waiting for thisLittle did they know I already had a scenario figured out He was the new fish in jail and I was the sexually reprehensible Victor Wolf Hey there I patted his shell things in here is mighty dangerous I can help you out if you know what I mean  The other cooks are snickering It moves forward a little I drag it to the edge of the board Oh yeah Feisty I like that I drag it to the edge and start humping the back of its tail Say my name baby Call me daddy Yeah Yeah Knife goes up overhand psycho style WHAM I pin him to the board I look over My coworkers are looking back at me smilingAnd then I notice At the edge of the serving window behind us is a little girlShe is petting one of the cart lobstersShe has a look of pure horror on her face One hand is by her side The other is touching the cart lobsters back Her mouth is wide open Oh Oh God Oh God I stammer The giant lobster is trying to flap his enormous tail I have to finish cutting him in half Then the butter and the cream By the time Ive finished this she was running across the room I wince in preparation for the biggest ass chewing everMy guess is she just didnt have the words to describe what she saw They ate paid and leftI toned down my act after that I imagine it made for some very entertaining therapy sessions down the lineTLDR I simulated the sexual assault of a gigantic lobster in front of a child,The

lechegrande,99,136,1b4wbh,798,Ive been a lurker here for some time now and after reading a few of these I feel that I have a few stories from a certain mall based cinnamon roll bakery The first of these stories I have added belowOur procedure for new rolls where they have to be baked for min and then frosted and put up on the hot plate for twenty minutes and then they get replaced with new fresher rolls When working towards the back end of a dinner rush we had one customer come in and ask us very politely if we had any non frosted rolls as he was a diabetic and could have a little bit of a roll and give the rest to his son I told him that wouldnt be a problem but it would take about  minutes for the next set of rolls to come out Well apparently that was the code word for him to lose his mind he looked at me and turned a bright shade of red and demanded to know why he had to wait at all I explained the companys policy and that we didnt keep rolls unfrosted unless they were special large orders He demanded to see the manager which unfortunately was me at that moment being the shift lead Of course this makes the man more irrate and he threatened to call the local news watch dog program that investigates corrupts businesses and sketchy business practices and report me specifically to them for diabetic discrimination After all his yelling and everything he failed to notice the fresh rolls pulled out of the oven or the slightly mentally handicapped kid carefully cut out an unfrosted roll and place it gently in a box like it was a newborn baby that would bruise if jostled to much This kid well call him Dave walks right up to the counter between me and the diabetic rage monster and hands it to him and says Excuse me sir I have your rrroll rrright here And I want you to know that these guys rrreally dont discriminate anyone here I should know The man was visibly stunned and put a  dollar bill down on the counter and hurried off child in one hand and unfrosted roll in the other I didnt bother calling him to come get his change back and gave it all to Dave for saving me from what Im sure would have been an endless tirade about how skewed my moral compass was,What do you mean I have to wait,934

regalfurpig,68,202,1hljc3,792,So this story happened a year or two ago during a very prominent trade show in the industry I work in The hotel that our company was staying at was kind enough to offer free drinks at their bar from  pm during happy hour and we are talking unlimited free drinks Most of the days that we were there I had to work past the cut off time but finally I was able to get out early enough and run back to the hotel just in time to make it before  I was literally the last person in line at  when a security guard stood in behind me to cut off the line as it would be past  by the time I made it to the front to be served Cue asshole douche bag well call him ADB who walks up to the security guard at  demanding to be served The security guard informs him politely that the line is cut off for today and he is more than welcome to come back tomorrow for free drinksADB wasnt having any of that and starts berating the security guard for being too stupid to tell that it wasnt yet  He demands to speak to the manager of the hotel a small and soft spoken woman who gives him the same reason why the line cuts off before  He continues to screech and his voice only gets louder as Im standing right next to him waiting for my ears to start bleeding Next he dials their corporate office on his mobile and continues to scream about the lousy customer service and how stupid and rude the staff have been I was about half the size of this guy and not a very outspoken person but I have worked many waitress jobs in my time and have experienced firsthand how awful and embarrassing it is to be berated like this in public and still have to be polite and courteous so something in me just snapped ADB was still on the phone at this point and before I knew it I was in his face shouting at him Shut the FUCK UP OK Just shut the fuck up Youre obviously getting your drink after treating the waitstaff like dirt so quit screaming in my ear quit being an asshole AND SHUT THE FUCK UP He was instantly quiet with his mouth open and his phone just dropped to his side Clearly no one had ever put him in his place before I turned around a bit red once I realized the whole bar was staring at me but then the person in front of me turned around and thanked me I apologized for being so loud but they insisted that they wished they had done the same I explained that I know how it feels after working in restaurants for so long at which point ADB piped in to try to say he had once worked in a restaurant too I turned around and said with as much venom in my voice as I could muster then you should know to treat people with a little decency shouldnt you which shut him right up I was still shaking when I ordered my TWO drinks I needed it after that and sat down at a table but it felt pretty awesome to put a rude asshole in his place I was met with smiles and winks by other people in the bar for the rest of the night TLDR Asshole douche bag treats hotel staff like garbage and I snap and shut him down so hard I even surprised myself Edit a wordEdit  changed offensive descriptors I apologize for offending anyone,Youre getting your drink so SHUT THE FUCK UP,994
DrunkenBlackBelt,151,240,19ngr1,792,So I work as a Security guard in a big corporate office Its shit Awful job  But sometimes we get to create a little fun with ourselves  For example our phone number is XXX XXX  The local CableSight office has the same number except the last  digits are   Needless to say about once or twice a day we get calls meant for Cablesight Hopefully the mods will allow this post since its customer service relatedNow when we answer the phone in the office we typically say NameofBuilding Security This is DrunkenBlackBelt How can I help you  Now for most people this is a BIG clue that they in fact didnt call Cablesight  Some will hang up but most will go Person I think I have the wrong number Im trying to reach CablesightMe You want to dial  this is Person Oh ok thank youSimple as that  And they are off on their merry way to complain about whatever issue they are having to the right people  However every so often you deal with someone Someone so stupid it hurts you way down in their soul  And naturally you must fuck with those people Take them down so many pegs that they will be envious of pirates with peglegs  This is a story of one of those peopleSo its an average day Im in the office working being a boss Looking sauve in my cheap standard issue suit  The phone rings A random number  My hand deftly reaches out for the phone I tense up ready to spring into action Is there a fire  Someone having a heart attack Or god forbid did someone ignore the stop signs and run their  Audi into another car Happens WAY more often than youd thinkMe Name of Bulding Security This is DrunkenBlackBelt How can I help youGullible Idiot  Yes Hi my name is Gullible Idiot and Id like to know why I have so many charges rental charges on my billMe Oh Mam Im sorry this is a security office You have theGI Not paying attention  We dont ever rent anything so I dont get why there is a  charge extra on hereMe  Mam You have the wrong numberGI WhatMe This is  you want   GI Thats what I dialedMe Obviously not as we are currently talking and I am not a Cablesight employeeGI Well I just want to talk to someone about my bill can you transfer me to the bills departmentMe One moment mamSo naturally I turned to my co worker and gave him a devilish grin The time for fuckery had begunMe Hi Mam I understand you are having issues with your bill Im looking at the charges right nowNow I assumed correctly as it turned out that this woman would think I somehow knew her account without asking her any questions  Somehow the fact that no cable company in the history of ever has picked up with a live person on the first ring had escaped her notice so maybe she wouldnt notice I just magically knew who she wasGI Yes I just dont understand why there is this charge for Me Well its typical for a rental fee for some movies lets check them out  GI Well we didnt rent anythingMe Well give me a second  Ok it says here that last weekend  movies were rented from your cable box Each film was  plus tax would make it GI What movies And how come they are so muchMe Well says here one was titled Chicks with Dicks  and the other is Tranny Heaven vol GI What  What type of movies are thoseMe Well mam they are adult movies featuring Transexuals  GI WHAT  WE DONT WATCH THAT KIND OF FILTHMe Mam Im not here to judge  All I know is that last saturday someone rented these movies on your cable boxGI Thats impossibleMe Your phone number is reads phone number off caller ID screenGI YesMe Well we have cable box makes up random serial code assigned to that number and thats where the rentals came from Perhaps youd like to talk to your family and see who rented theseGI Well Ill have to it has to be a mistakeMe Well mam hopefully theyll listen to you because you sure didnt listen to me in the beginning of the callGI  What  I dont followMe Anything else I can help you with  GI Umm no thank you  I have to go sit down for a bitMe Welp thanks for calling Cablesight have a wonderful dayAt which point I hang up and start losing it My cowoker had stuffed his tie in his mouth to keep from cracking up  I was expecting her to call back all day yelling and screaming when she figured it out but nothing ever came of it  TLDR  Dude looks like a lady YEA YEAEdit  So Ive been messaged asking to take down this post and change the title and repost  Apparently a lot of people are reporting it as offensive And the the subreditt rTransphobiaProject has made a post about me herehttpwwwredditcomrTransphobiaProjectcommentsoebcasualtransphobiainrtalesfromretail   So this is my response  I feel bad if anyone took any offense to this  None was intended  However I wont remove it of my own volition Hope this doesnt put pressure on the mods  But I dont see anything offensive about it  To me Transexual porn is no different than any other fetish porn involving a physical preference  If I had said it was Pegging Porn Im sure Id be getting messages from ProPeggers saying they feel Im being offensive to their preferences Also thats just a general point I realize there is a difference between being born transgender and enjoying a physical act  You all hopefully see my point though  In my different jobs especially when I worked LP in a store that sold lingerie Ive had to deal with Straight Gay Lesbian Trans White Black Tall Short etc etc people  At no point did any of it make a difference to me  Only time it ever caused an issue was when I had to write up an employee for some remarks after we had a man who lived his life as a woman use the fitting rooms in the lingerie store  A buddy of mine is someone who feels like he is a woman in a mans body But I dont even think of that except the time he told a girl at work she had a hairier chest than he did Now that was fucking funny  My point here is that I think its a little ridiculous that people are getting so bent out of shape over this I cant even begin to pretend that I can sympathize with someone who is living transgender  Its just not physically possible for me I can empathize though Im sure its a tough confusing issue to have to live with  But at the same time that doesnt mean that every mention is a jab at you  If I had said something like Transgenders are mutants and deserve to be killed then yea bring on the hate mail Thats a bigoted hateful statement  And anyone who would say that deserve to be hated  But I would think we can all agree that that is not what I said at all  A veiled CLERKS reference while mentioning a type of porno that is outside of Vanilla porn but still available for rental as far as I am aware from cable companies  All that being said I will freely admit that I am the type to find nothing taboo as far as humor  Im a fat guy but love fat jokes  I firmly believe humor will get you through anything I really hope this has cleared things up but urge anyone who has found this offense or anyone from rTransphobiaProject to contact me if they have any questions and wish to discuss this like reasonable adults  Sorry again to the mods Remove it if you must but its my choice not too   Thank you all and have a good day,Security Shenannigans How the difference between the s  and  can lead to Tranny Porn,1032

pandamunchr,209,157,19iptc,791,Does anyone else get this all the timeI work in a shop that specialises in board games I always get customers who think they have the brightest kids in the world So when it comes to games that are suggested to be more suitable for children a few years older than theirs they think it should be fine because they are smart enough to figure it out themselvesHad a customer come into the store and ask about a particular board game that she saw in a news article the previous week called Ticket to Ride I told her it was an excellent game as I have played it heaps and have thoroughly enjoyed it Then she starts telling me that it was for her grandchildren to play with her I ask for their age and they were about  years younger than the suggested age for the board game I go on to mention this and start recommending games that I believed would be suitable for their age and that they would really enjoy She keeps going back to the original board game she came in for and questions me as to whether or not her children would be able to understand the game How am I supposed to know I politely replied by repeating the recommended age as shown on the box and repeated my experience with the game in saying that the rules are fairly straightforward but it was the strategy that was needed to be put in the game that required older players I said that the kids might get disinterested by it since they will probably lose most of the games against adults and not be able to understand why and how they could change the way their strategy in the game She dismisses my argument and says they are really bright for their age and so it should be fine then proceeds to the counter to purchase it  weeks later I answer a call in the store and a lady asks about Ticket to Ride and how she had purchased it and couldnt understand the rules and was too complicated for her and her grandchildren to follow and wanted a refund for the game I suggested watching some videos online of demo games if the rule book was too complicated which frankly isnt the rules are very straightforward and easy to follow She claims to have done so and still couldnt understand and asked for a refund for a game that she had opened and attempted to play because apparently the girl serving her in the store me told her that it was suitable for really young children which I never said I confronted her and said that I remember serving her and I did recommend other games more suitable for her grandchildrens age and that I could not do anything once the product has been openedShe sounded pretty angry and hung up the phone,Oh that should be fine my kids are very smart for their age,948

YeahJordy,189,213,1py1fk,779,Background I used to work at a discount store and since there was only a handful of workers we were jack of all trades I packed shelves helped customers worked the register everything including changing lights while they were on because my manager assured me it was perfectly safeStory Anyway the night in particular that this story unfolded my manager decided to buy myself and the other worker a thickshake while she went and changed some money So here I am with my thickshake packing those personalised number plates onto a rack when I see a customer at the register waiting to be served so I dash over and begin serving Now I feel its worth mentioning that this store is pretty close to a junky area and so we get our fair share of painful customers This night was no exceptionI went back to packing plates and after a while I realised my thickshake was missing My manager promptly points out that this tattooed man with a rats tail and filthy clothes sorry for judgemental imagery Im still slightly bitter was slurping on my shake I confronted him not quite sure what to say and he got immensely defensive eventually offering it back to me I just shook it off and kept workingHalf an hour or so later my manager yells out that someone is in our storeroom she was behind the counter and had seen it on the CCTV our storeroom is at the far corner of the store and clearly has an EMPLOYEES ONLY plaque on it I sprinted up towards the back and sure enough as I approached this woman the kind you can confidently assume to be an addict is walking out of the storeroom and I see her drop something into her bag I confront her and she avoids eye contact and tries to busy herself with the nearby shelfMe What were you doing in there What is in your bagWoman Theres nothing in my bag Im just lookingMe I saw you drop something in your bag show me what it wasWoman I aint done nothingWe went back and forth arguing for a while and I was getting frustrated so I left her and ran back to the storeroom saw my backpack had been unzipped and sure enough my iPod was missing I ran back to the woman who had met up with the shake thief from earlier and handed him my iPod subtly I saw it in his hands and practically yelled Thats not yours Why did you take this as I snatched it back and he yelled in return I didnt do nothingThe next part is a bit blurry from the adrenaline I was experiencing but essentially the two junkies refused to explain anything to me Next thing I knew a lady pulled me aside and was asking me all these questions and I noticed another  were talking to the pair of thieves This lady told me that she and her  friends were plainclothed policemenwomen who just happened to be walking by the shop as my manager screamed out about the woman in the storeroom since there had been reports of thieves in the shopping centre recently She asked me a bunch of questions and after half an hour or so I got back to work as they kept interrogating the thievesAs I was working a male policeman MP came up and this is the conversation that unfoldedMP Hey mate how old are youMe  I turn  in a few weeksMP laughs Hah I thought soMe Whats so funnyMP Well this woman finally admitted to stealing your iPod but she claims that she only did it to get back at you for hitting on her in the club the other night In Australia you have to be  to go clubbing I knew she was lyingBut you wouldnt go there would youMe thinking that he meant going clubbing No I wouldnt clubs definitely dont seem like somewhere Id like to be at all even when I am MP No I meant herWe both had a good laugh about that remark and it made me feel a bit better The police took down my details and then they escorted the junkies out and gave them a lifetime ban from the shopId like to say that was the end of it but  minutes later the junky woman returns and just says I know Im banned but when I was out the back I left my phone out there can I just go get it please Oh It looks just like that one she points to my managers phone sitting near the register We politely tell her to get lost and never come back The nerve of some peopleSince then Ive had to give an official police statement but havent heard much else past that although I know she got charged Also my brothers girlfriend works in a different discount store around the corner and she has had some stories with the same woman too but thats for another time,The night the customer stole from my backpack,992

chargeshttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsboqxqwhyamibleedingorhowsimplestatementscan  Yelling at the wrong guy or how a bitchy lady learned what handcuffs felt like httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbagdyellingatthewrongguyorhowabitchyladyBefore I begin I need to say that people have tried to guess the location of my station in the comments section of my previous stories  Please dont  Its against the sidebar rules and Id like to maintain a little bit of anonymity  If you think youve figured out which station it is just smile to yourself and feel good about your detective work LouToday on a very special episode of Gas Station AdventuresMy previous stories have all involved law enforcement  This one thankfully does not  It involves a nice summer day a father with his young son out for a walk and years of Boy Scout training being put to good useI had only been working at the station for about  months and spring was getting ready to move out so that summer could move in turn up the heat and eat ice cream sandwiches on the couch while watching reruns of Ren and Stimpy  As I stood my vigil behind the cash register a small fan blowing stillwarm air across my face a man came rushing into the store carrying a small boy  The mans face was that of nearpanic eyes wide pale muscles taught  His voice shook as he quickly explained to me that as he and his son were out walking they ran into a bees nest  The boy had been stung something that he had not experienced before and had very quickly started to show the signs of an allergic reaction  Could I please call Sir you just walked into the right storeI vaulted the counter and checked on the little boy  Yep he was in trouble  His face and neck were swollen he was wheezing badly and obviously having trouble breathing he was covered in hives and his heart rate was insanely fast  He whimpered in that pathetic manner that a young child will when they are very scared  Damn  I opened the door and yelled for Alan name changed to run overMe  Alan do you have your cell phoneAlan  Uh yeah whyMe  Good  Listen closely  Run up to the fire station and knock on the door  Tell them they have a male child suffering from bad anaphylaxis due to a possible bee sting here at the station and they need to get down here right away  If you cannot get a hold of someone at the door or the engines are gone call  and tell them the same thing then bust your ass back down here  Now repeat that back to meAlan  Run to the fire station boy anaphylaxis bee sting call  if no one is thereMe  Good  Now RUNAnd off he went doing his level best to make Usain Bolt look like an asthmatic sloth with some heavy shoppingBut Osiris why didnt you call  right then  Isnt that what you are supposed to do in those kind of medical emergenciesA very good question Timmy  And normally that is exactly what I would have done  However in a situation like that time is your enemy  Had I called  it would have taken a minute or two to get on the line with the dispatcher relay them the information and have the dispatcher call out the emergency  Two three maybe even four minutes before the firefighters start rolling  However in this case the fire station is quite literally  yards away  Alan could run there in under  seconds and talk to the firefighters directly shaving off a ton of time  And since I hadnt heard the fire trucks leave at all that day I was pretty certain they were still thereAs Alan was doing his Jesse Owen impression I ran out to my car and grabbed my first aid kit  My lovely handassembled nearlyinvestment first aid kit  In it were the finest medical tools money and a civilian could buy  Blood pressure cuff  Pulse oximeter  Stethoscope  Medications  Hell it even had a suture kit  It got stolen out of my car two years ago and Im still pissed about it  I got to work monitoring the kids vitals while writing down everything I could from the father who was in tears  Within seconds I heard the wail of a siren  Proper help was on the wayMoments later several burly firefighters came through the door in that very businesslike manner that firefighters have when they are facing a serious situation  I got out of their way and started relaying information to the supervisor  They pumped the kid full of epinephrine got him on an oxygen mask loaded him onto a gurney and rushed him out to the rescue truck  Total time elapsed from the moment the father walked through the door to being in the truck maybe  minutesI went outside and lit up a cigarette  My hands shook  I hadnt had to perform any sort of emergency medicine like that in years  Kind of amazing how all that stuff I learned in Boy Scouts instantly came back to mind even though I had been out of the program for almost  years  I kept thinking about that little boy hoping that he would be alrightI had the next three days off during which time I was busy with school and a girlfriend  But upon my return the father was there with the boy  The father thanked me profusely first by giving me a big hug  He offered to reward me for what I had done which I of course turned down  I explained that as an Eagle Scout it was my duty and pleasure to help other people at all times  Seeing the little boy happy and healthy was more than enough reward  The boy himself was a bit shy but still said thank you  I smiled all day longTLDR  I really sound like Im patting myself on the back here,A sick little boy or NOT THE BEES,970

JellyTip,43,160,1gkock,772,I used to work for a multinational fast fashion female retail store I have far too many bad stories to tell I like to focus on the good My favourite customer ever was a middle aged man who came into our busy street front shop holding his hat flicking through random things I could tell he was shopping for himself so I treated him like everyone else positive tone asking him questions putting together outfits Over half an hour he gradually loosened up started laughing and smiling his personality came out We had an awesome tryout session he kept saying it all looked bad without his hair and makeup I just said he will have to come back with it to see The next day he walks in in heels stockings knee length denim skirt ampamp blouse with full makeup and wig Looked like a knockout He scurried in then smiled An amazing smile made his way over to me and we picked up where we left off the day before I loved that I could help make him smile like that give him a happy no questions place to come and be himself in public I think of him whenever I need a pick me up ,Thank you to the guy who came into my store and brought dresses,932

PhishnChips,142,258,1c3jsm,780,This tale comes from my serverbartending days not the pharmacy As you can tell from some of my other stories I dont take shit Its probably due to the fact that at this point I was a veteran and just didnt have time for your stupid customer BS After youve been through some of the shit Ive been through the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesnt seem to matter much to me Just dont be doucher and well be cool Now on to the tale I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders Nothing says hello nice to meet you quite as eloquently as Ill have a diet shell have a diet and he wants an iced tea But what can you do Theyre not sociable people fine I still have a job to do I went and fetched their springs Apparently Ive been relegated to wench tonight When I returned with drinks there was  dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there He said to me gruffly This is your tip tonight Youll start off with  every time I think you screw up or do something I dont like Im removing a dollar or two In my head I said Im not a stripper Im not dancing for your dollarWhat I really said as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was Sir you want to hold on to this the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you I will give you the same service I give all of my tables excellent At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip youd like to leave And before he could respond I added Would you guys like to start with an appetizer I could see in his face that he was going to object but before he got a chance his wife reading the situation correctly that I wasnt going to put up with her husbands shit gave me their app order and I was off to my next table I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means but they didnt request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous At the end of the meal I ended up with a  dollar tip Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face but I wasnt even mad that was still  TLDR customer wants a handy with a reach around I give him a punch in the solar plexus instead Edit spelling,Im a server not a stripper I wont dance for your dollar,1038
offbeathamster,206,218,1oshit,768,I Work weekends on the information desk in a large shopping centre and during my time there I have met all sorts of odd people but this guy has to be the worstHe lost his  or  year old son in the centre at a peak time on Saturday no sweat just look for the kid and if all else fails get us to send out an announcement or at least check his kid wasnt at the desk right Wrong This fucknut waits a full  minutes for the kid to find him before deciding fuck this and going homeThe kid had more common sense he found his way to us at the desk and we attempted to find the father no luck After  minutes of security searching we were unable to find or contact the father and were ready to call the policeThen the father rings us and tells us Id like to report a lost child lost about an hour ago He doesnt sound worried or even interested This is clearly just an inconvenience to him But we match up the descriptions and ask him to pick up his offspringThis is where I really lost faith in humanity The guy tells us honestly and openly that he will not pick up his lost son because and I quote Ive got home now and I have started dinner He even goes as far as to tell the child to walk back the journey would take at least an hour and a half probably more It took five minutes of us threatening to get the police involved for him to finally agree to pick the child upEDIT The boy said he spent  mins looking on the different levels for his father initially he only wanted to go up onto the next floor and back down again The neighbourhood the boy said they lived it is relatively goodHowever the thing which is most significant and really annoys me is that it had been raining it was dark pm The reason why we did not call the CPS is that we were letting security handle it They were assessing all the options and were about to call the CPS when the father agreed to pick up the child but  guards had a long word with him escorting him to the car park,Lost Child Some people shouldnt have kids,986
Scarlett,66,114,10zo1d,772,Just started browsing reddit a few weeks ago thought Id finally make an account D So this is my first post hereAnyway a few months back I was setting up some metal home decor sculptures on a shelving unit at the end of an aisle While I was doing this there was a man in a business suit having a very loud very animated cell phone conversation He was pacing back and forth and waving his free arm around pretty dramatically From hearing his side of the conversation it sounded like he had a major business deal fall throughJust then a mother with a toddler sleeping in his stroller came down the aisle She was clearly in her s at least and had a wedding ring on She had to make two attempts to get around the guy since he was pacing back and forth at the end of the aisle and didnt even notice that he almost walked right into the stroller Just as she starts to go by him though his arm knocks several of these heavy metal sculptures off the shelf making a huge amount of noise Two of them land right next to the stroller waking the toddler upNow the kid had clearly been fast asleep and being startled awake by a couple large heavy metal objects smashing to the ground right next to you can be pretty upsetting So he starts crying and the mother stops a couple feet away to try and soothe him Apparently this annoyed the guy on the phone since he turns around and almost yells at her If you cant keep your fing little brat quiet you shouldnt have opened your fing legs you little slut Now shut that fing kid upI couldnt believe that hed actually said that to her and the mother was cleary shocked as well She looked on the verge of tears herself so I took her straight over to the customer service area where my manager was I told him what had happened and he kicked the guy out of the store and banned him from our storeWe gave the kid a pack of cookies to help cheer him up with the moms permission and gave her a gift card for our store Ive seen my share of nasty customers before but this guy really blew them all out of the water,One of the nastiest customers Ive encountered to another customer,886

FredFltStn,130,285,1py6ce,754,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  My staff is mainly comprised of teenagers with the guys working on the sales floor and the girls working the registers Im not trying to be sexist its just that some of the cases can weigh up to  pounds massive assortment and I dont want anyone getting hurtWeve seen people show up to buy fireworks dressed in more ways than you can imagine From formal attire to pajamas to clothing thats basically underwear Then again we are a fireworks tent in a parking lot so theres pretty much no dress code I thought I had seen it all NopeShe walked into the tent in an outfit that left NOTHING to the imagination She had on a micro skirt and a skin tight top that was basically seethrough I swear to God a noticeable hush fell over the tent when this girl and her friend walked through the door enough so that I actually turned around to see what was going onOne of the guys came over and gave me the scoop The girls name was Brittany and she actually went to school with Josh Oh yeah she also happens to be a porn star now acting under the name Brittany Sexton You are definitely going to want to Google that nameI dont want to say that the men in my tent were distracted but Im pretty sure I could have yelled fire and none of them would have moved toward the exits Ill be honest here I may have been momentarily distracted myselfIm pretty sure there were several guys who would have volunteered to carry her on their back while she shopped so she wouldnt get tired In fact I think the only thing that prevented them from offering was that every time she bent over her micro skirt combined with her lack of underwear provided a preview of her next feature filmOne of my cashiers has a boyfriend that also works for me She grabbed him off the sales floor and yanked him back to the counter so fast I was concerned he may have gotten whiplashEventually she and her friend finished shopping and they were ready to check out I rang her up myself but it was just a coincidence that I ran to the counter and gave all of my cashiers a breakI cant remember if I gave her a discount I did but I can guarantee that when I offered to make her a partner and give her half the business it was just a joke it wasntI think when she was finished she had two bags of fireworks It took five guys to carry them out to her carIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,We have no dress code and it shows Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1039

Except for this onehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvdQwwWgXcQNice days mean nice cars at the station  And given the wealth of the neighborhood nice cars mean stuff the rest of us only ever see at car shows race tracks and while playing Need for Speed  The car that BDB Bald Douche Bag  drove in that day was no exception  A glossblack  hp L V Lamborghini Murcielago LP  Roadster  A car worth more than most peoples houses  Also something completely unreasonable to own in a residential location with a relatively low highway speed limitI definitely noticed the car drive in because its impossible NOT to notice the throaty rumble of a Lambo as it idles up into a parking lot  I watched as one of our attendants goes over greets the driver does the usual shebang to figure out what to get him etc etc  But things get a pit odd when the attendant goes to the pump and tries to use the card given to him  Hes obviously having difficulty with something but hes a bit too far away to see what  He goes back to the driver speaks with him for a moment and then hurriedly backs up as the driver flings open the door and starts storming towards the store  BDB then rants and gesticulates towards the pumps to which the attendant quickly moves and begins punching in the codes for a payafterthefact  Great  Entitlement thy name is Lambo ownerNow BDB is very easy to describe  Imagine Mr Clean  Same bald head same tight white shirt same tight white pants same musculature  Now replace his face with that of Christopher Titus  You are now  accurate  Oh and have him doing this rather amazing scowlsneer to get his mood rightYour guy out there cant seem to make my card work he loudly states slamming what looks like a credit card but doesnt sound like plastic down on the counter  Ah  The Black Amex  Yes one of those rare and mysterious things that are semilegend in the retail community  If you are not familiar with the Black Amex its a variation of the Platinum American Express card that you are invited to have  The minimum monthly payment is  and its limit while not actually being infinity is EXTREMELY high  They are very rare and only owned by people or businesses with tons of money  They are also made out of metal and slightly thicker than standard plastic credit cardsWhich is why it wouldnt run out at the pump because it physically wouldnt fit in the credit card slot  A delicious bit of irony I must sayNo problem sir it just seems that your card is a bit thicker than most  Let me run it here forummmwell now it doesnt seem to fit through this one eitherIt didnt  I couldnt get it to fit through the slot on our card reader  BDB then snatched the card out of my hand and tried himself but it was pretty obvious it wasnt going to fit without a crowbar being handy  I smiled apologeticallyWell then just type the damned numbers in manuallySir Id like to do that but in order to do so I have to run an manual imprint of the card Aside I was quite used to doing this our satellite connection went down all the freakin time  I cant do that with your card because the numbers arent raised and they wont allow me to just write them down  Im terribly sorry do you have another card you can pay withCue a long rant about how this card was supposed to be accepted everywhere he was worth blah blah blah hes so important the usual drill which I quickly tuned out  As he was stroking his ego to near completion I was continuing to monitor what was going on outside just in case something more important could offer me an excuse to dismiss this guy such as someone dropping a piece of paper on the ground  But what I instead saw was one of the local cops pulling up to the store  While I took note of it it did not fully register in my mind since nothing illegal was happening nor did I expect anything illegal to happenSo the cop walks in while BDB is in midbluster stops crosses his arms and leans against the counter as if to say Boy Ive had a boring shift but heres something entertaining I can watch for a few minutesI recoalesce my attention on BDB and again apologize and ask if he has any other way to pay  He doesnt WANT to pay another way he doesnt HAVE to hes a BLACK AMEX HOLDER  I explain that since I physically cant accept the card due to equipment issues Im going to need another form of payment  At this point BDB opens his mouth and says something that gives me one of the greatest openings in the history of things being openWell what would you do if I just drove off right nowI tried I really tried not to smile  But it was too much and the smile I had was quite broad as I replied Well sir I wouldnt be able to do a lot  But the guy behind you might do something about itBDB turns around to see the local cop standing there with a big feral grin on his face nodding emphatically  The color on BDBs face drained away as his ego deflated down to much more tolerable levels  In stony silence he produced a different credit card ran it signed for it and stormed out of the station  As soon as the door closed the cop and I both started laughing like crazy  When I could finally speak again I told the cop You should go pull him over for having a tail light out or something  At which point we cracked up all over again  Never did see BDBTLDR  Anyone who designs theatrical stages should be required by law to construct them as well at

Dcoil,81,145,154etw,737,Back in High School I worked at Pizza Hut I had worked there for almost a year as a cook and though I hated the job I generally got along well with my coworkers and supervisorsOne day an old middle school friend calls me up to tell me hes coming to visit for the weekend in a couple weeks and I told him Id request the weekend off so we could hang out The next day I put in my request and its granted no questions askedThe night before my friend is supposed to arrive I report to work for my shift and walk into the managers office to check my schedule as I always do Immediately I notice that my two requested days off now have pmpm hastily scrawled onto them in pencil in the managers handwriting who was sitting a few feet away talking to the assistant manager Before I even had a chance to react I blurted out What the hell The two managers paused their conversation and said Something wrong Dcoil Uh yeah I requested these two days off two weeks ago Now youve penciled in that Im working Store Manager Yeah Soandso quit yesterday and we need someone to work that shiftMe Well Im sorry but I have a friend coming into town this weekend and we made plans I dont think I can work this scheduAssistant Manager Its not a question of whether or not you can work that shift Dcoil Youre GOING to work that shiftI was furious I couldnt even say another word I just scowled at them and stormed out I spent the whole night fuming not saying another word to them and weighing my options and trying to decide if I really needed this job or not At the end of my shift I didnt stick around one extra minute I punched out at exactly the time I was scheduled offThe next morning I called in and the Assistant Manager answered I said Hi this is Dcoil Im not coming in today because I asked for it off and was approved and you guys put me back on the schedule without even consulting me or asking whether I can work the shift I dont appreciate being told I have to work a shift You can fire me if you want but Im not working todayASM fine ClickI thought surely I was getting canned but I had a great weekend despite of it with my friend and when my next shift rolled around I walked in and punched in like nothing happened and no one said a word to me In fact the ASM didnt say anything to me for a week or two but she eventually got over it,My proudest moment of resisting a managers bullshit,882
ImAMattressSalesman,78,183,1htliq,736,I have been working for a large mattress retailer managing and selling mattresses for the last  years As you can assume I have amassed a large number of stories from ridiculous and unbelievably stupid customers but this one is one of my favorites A customer came in to our store one afternoon and explained that his current box spring was deemed defective and he wanted to exchange it for a new one and buy a new mattress in addition to the exchange Not a problem one of my sales associates took care of him and being new to retail sales ended up giving way too big of a discount on the bed but whatever the customer is happy Or so I thought About two days later I am leaving my shift and headed home to change and take my gf out to a concert for the night when I get a call on my cell phone from a number I dont recognize I decide to answer it and Immediately regret this decision as my casual greeting of hello is met with a barrage of insults and demands of someone who is in a crazy fit of rage Keep in mind I am off of work and do not give customers my personal cell phone number so I am extremely confused as to not only what this person is talking about but also how they were able to get my number I begin to piece together that this is the customer who had set up a warranty exchange the other day and he has been berating my sales staff all afternoon and one of them has cracked and given him my number under duress big big no no but one problem at a time Being the customer service professional that I believe myself to be decide to hear this angry customer out and find out how we have wronged him By the way he is yelling at me Im assuming we have killed his dog or brought some sort of irreversible shame upon his family but it turns out that the drivers had refused him the exchange we set up a few days ago After listening to this customers opinions on my managementbusiness skills being shouted at me for a few more minutes Im able to find out why the drivers had refused his exchange The customer gave away his defective box spring There was nothing to exchange for because he got rid of it He didnt know he had to keep the defective product for the exchange EXCHANGE Meaning we take the old product and you take the new stuff Thats how an exchange works you fucking dipshit Its called a fucking exchange Is what I wanted to scream into the phone but I calmly tried to explain to the customer as if he was a  year old how an exchange works and why the drivers werent going to give him a new box spring for free This still didnt make sense to him and he had become even more angry because he owned his own business and would never treat his customers this way Really guy So if I buy a refrigerator from you call you up a year later and tell you that its broken I can come in and get a new one free of charge without giving you back the old one with no proof of any defect Yeah Once I put it in these terms the guy decided to end our call by telling me that he is going to come strangle me He never did and he never got his exchange Fuck that guy TLDR Customer thinks an exchange is a one sided transaction and berates my sales staff and I about it Ends up threatening to kill me because of it Retail is fun ,Customer doesnt know how an exchange works Threatens to strangle me because of it,919
FredFltStn,224,332,1q9jql,732,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Most of my employees are teenagers and have real jobs during the rest of the year just like me Even so they jump at the chance to work for me since I pay better feed them give them free fireworks and always try to make my store funLast th of July I had a couple of new guys helping out during setup One of the news guys dropped a beam while setting up some rack shelving and it almost hit his foot He turned to one of the teenagers Colby and joked that he would need workers compColby has worked for me for several years now Without looking up or stopping his work Colby perfectly explained our workers comp policy just as it had been explained to him years beforeCraig doesnt have workers comp If you get seriously hurt we have to kill you and hide the bodyThis location has gone  DAYS since our last accidentTLDR  Workers compensation is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employees right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence The tradeoff between assured limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as the compensation bargainWhile plans differ among jurisdictions provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance compensation for economic loss past and future reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses functioning in this case as a form of health insurance and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment functioning in this case as a form of life insuranceGeneral damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers compensation plans and negligence is generally not an issue in the case These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania with the United States following shortly thereafterStatutory compensation law provides advantages to employees and employers A schedule is drawn out to state the amount and forms of compensation to which an employee is entitled if heshe has sustained the stipulated kinds of injuries Employers can buy insurance against such occurrences However the specific form of the statutory compensation scheme may provide detriments Statutes often award a set amount based on the types of injury These payments are based on the ability of the worker to find employment in a partial capacity a worker who has lost an arm can still find work as a proportion of a fully able person This does not account for the difficulty in finding work suiting disability When employers are required to put injured staff on lightduties the employer may simply state that no light duty work exists and sack the worker as unable to fulfill specified duties When new forms of workplace injury are discovered for instance stress repetitive strain injury silicosis the law often lags behind actual injury and offers no suitable compensation forcing the employer and employee back to the courts although in commonlaw jurisdictions these are usually oneoff instances Finally caps on the value of disabilities may not reflect the total cost of providing for a disabled worker The government may legislate the value of total spinal incapacity at far below the amount required to keep a worker in reasonable living conditions for the remainder of his lifeA related issue is that the same physical loss can have a markedly different impact on the earning capacity of individuals in different professions For instance the loss of a finger could modestly reduce a bankers professional facilities but ruin a pianistIn  Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts  other states passed similar acts between  and  These acts simply permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission A similar scheme was set forth in Britains  ActAfter Germanys  Act workers compensation laws began to be reformed to reduce the need for litigation and to mitigate the requirement that injured workers prove their injuries were their employers fault For example The  British Act replaced the  ActIn the United States the first statewide workers compensation law was passed in Maryland in  and the first law covering federal employees was passed in  By  all states had enacted some kind of workers compensation regime Such schemes were originally known as workmans compensation but today most jurisdictions have adopted the term workers compensation as a genderneutral alternativeAt the turn of the th century workers compensation laws were voluntary for a couple of reasons Specifically an elective law made passage easier and many felt that compulsory workers compensation laws would violate the th amendment due process clause of the US Constitution Since workers compensation mandated benefits without regard to fault or negligence many felt that compulsory participation would deprive the employer of property without due process The issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in  when in New York Central Railway Co v White it was held that an employers constitutional rights werent affected After the ruling most states enacted new compulsory workers compensation lawsIn the United States most employees who are injured on the job have an absolute right to medical care for any injury and in many cases monetary payments to compensate for resulting temporary or permanent disabilities Most employers are required to subscribe to insurance for workers compensation and an employer who does not may have financial penalties imposed If youve actually been crazy enough to read through all of this text you should seriously consider seeking some type of professional help The entire TLDR was meant as a joke and the short story was actually above the TLDR I do appreciate your persistance and to show it please allow me to bestow gold on the first  of you that obviously have nothing better to do than surf reddit and can follow my instructions Please add a comment to this story that starts with Candygram for Mongo Feel free to say whatever else youd like in the comment since you seen to have some free time Of course the first five have long come and gone if youre reading this now but what the hellTexas employers have the unique ability to opt out of a the Workers Compensation system under the original state law written in  However those employers known as nonsubscribers are exposed to potential liability in the event of an employee injury Though the employee must prove that the employer was negligent in causing his or her injuries the employer loses its common law defenses of contributory negligence assumption of the risk and the fellow employee doctrine If successful the employee can recover his or her full common law damages which are far more generous than workers compensation benefits Yeah this story is about that Thanks WikipediaIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories

toxlab,88,130,1mlshh,729,I originally posted this as a reply to uFredFltStnin s post about telling off a jerky customer Heres a story about a crazy customer from my teenage yearsOnly once in my life have I had an opportunity to speak up for a retail wage slave having to put up with some idiots nonsense Granted it was pretty monumentalI was taking a road trip with some high school buddies and we stopped at a burger joint As soon as I got through the door I heard yelling A crazy woman was doing this huge dramatic number about how she had been ripped off and wanted her money back The fact that her family had eaten a huge tray of food and felt it wasnt up to snuff meant she deserved to get it all freeThe cashier just kept saying The manager will be here in a minute While backing away from the counter Crazy Bitch keeps leaning over and trying to poke the cashier After a minute or two one of our party tells her to stop yelling and mind her manners This does not sit well with Crazy Bitch and she turns to yell at us They go back and forth for a few minutes with her threatening to go get her purse and Put some bullets in ya The whole time shes acting up and being a tool The drivers girlfriend had been in the bathroom When she returned to find CB poking the driver she decided to get involved It bears mention that GF was a Jeet Kun Do studentShe grabbed CB by the shoulder and spun her around When CBs hands came up she got a devastating chop to the throat A graceful leg sweep put her on the floor GF dropped a knee into her chest pinning her to the groundShes wailing like a banshee Husband comes running over and starts shucking and jiving about all the damage hes going to do before becoming aware that he is now surrounded by punk rock teenagers who really really like to fuck shit upAfter about five minutes of this the cops show up They ask GF to get off of CB When she pops up she goes off on a diatribe about how we were skinheads looking for minorities to beat up Every time the cops start to ask a question she starts yelling They keep telling her to button her lip and finally tell her shes going to get cuffed if she cant shut up Her husband picks up the slack and starts inventing slurs that we threw outAt this point I tell the cops that CB claimed to have a gun in her purse and that said purse was sitting in the dining room next to the couples unattended childrenSuddenly CB stops screaming and is ready to leave Theyre all going to go right now She starts hollering at her children who jump up She wants out of there NOWThe cops take this as a good sign that CB is indeed packing heat The purse is now unattended and the family is trying to beat feet One cop holds them up while the other opens the purse Well whaddaya know A handgunThe manager had arrived and was watching this go down Eventually we turned from the ongoing spectacle and proceeded to get our grub onIt had been a long hungry day so we all got a silly amount of food When I got the total I went to pay and discovered that the only bill I had that would cover the cost was a hundred The cashier explained that they didnt take Bens and we all started going through pocketsI asked the manager if he could make an exception as I didnt have enough twenties to pay the fare He just looked at me for a minute pulled out his keys punched some buttons and zeroed out the check He said On the house and went into the backWe got our loaded down trays and sat in the dining room The whole time we were eating we got to watch CB and hubby being run through the wringer Had she kept her mouth shut she may have gotten away But once the cuffs were on she ramped up her bullshit until the cops looked like they were going to put her under the jailWhen I unwrapped my burger we all marveled at the amount of bacon that had been put on It was comical All our sandwiches looked like the pictures on the menu rather than the sad reality that they usually are Even though we were starving there was just too much food to eat in one sitting We packed up our leftovers and went back to the counter to say thanks The cashier looked happy I looked over to see CB sitting there in cuffs waiting for someone to get her children before she went to jail and I waved goodbyeOne of the most delicious dinner and a show combos Ive ever had,An unruly customer gets whats coming to her,859

bbornotbb,62,221,1l0tcc,729,My job recently finished a sale that we have every year that the employees affectionately refer to as the worst goddamn day of our life sale Its our version of our garage sale when we throw broken old and overstocked crap onto a table mark it down to about  its original cost and let the customers descend upon it like piranhas feasting on a cowCustomers mainly middle age middle class women start lining up outside our gate a full hour before we open pushing and shoving and fighting to get to the sale and fight over a statue missing a head an ornament celebrating  a strand of Christmas lights in a lovely shade of pee yellowThe best part of the sale is I get to say no No we will not box wrap bag that heavily discounted item No you cant speak to the manager No you cant get another discount No no no no no no no Tis glorious to say noThis year was shaping up to be a doozy with the ladies and occasional hapless husband looking confused and frightened clawing at the gates and looking at their watches and sighing loudly We opened the gates and in they tore the guy opening the gates nimbly hopped on a cart to avoid being trampled Their hands were in claws as they shoved for carts and basketsOne of my cashiers could not get to safety fast enough Shes eight months pregnant Her eyes widened with fear as the snarling beast rushed towards her The lead animal pushed her aside screaming MOVE The cashier fell into the display racks she was standing next to as the swarm continued passed Luckily she was not hurt just mad and scared that her baby could have been seriously hurtMe Well I was fuming These are GROWN women acting like toddlers and hell that is not rightFortunately for me the woman who pushed the cashier rolled her junk right through my line I debating ways to get back at her for shoving as she handed over cash to payShe gave me a fifty which I ran through my counterfeit machine Our machine has a small sensor that squeaks when the magnetic ink is rubbed over it and a small red light that turns on But she didnt know that So I had an evil idea I told her the bill was not passing my counterfeit machine and that I could not accept it She was furious to say the least with visible steam pouring from her snout Especially since she had to run down the block to an ATM to get out twentiesBut hey if you wanted me to make your life easy maybe you shouldnt have shoved a pregnant girl ,The Running of the Bulls or Why Middle Age Middle Class Women Suck,950

DrunkenBlackBelt,90,171,147nvp,719,Hello TFR  I have shared many of my Loss Prevention shenanigans over the few weeks I have been on here but I wanted to share with you the one story that always gets a shocked response whenever its told  Now over my LP career at different institutions I have been assaulted spit on seen a large woman remove  worth of clothes from her fat rolls and even ran a couple of miles to grab a suspect  But this is the only time I have ever seen a parent neglect a childNow shoplifters using children is nothing new  And usually it incurred a charge of child endangerment  However sometimes the cops would let it slide if the person co operated and the child was so young they had no way of knowing what was going on  That being said we begin our taleOne fine sunny afternoon I am working at a store we will call GdNickels doing my LP thing  My female co worker Stacy is watching these two teenaged girls pushing baby carriage around with a blanket covering the inside of the carriage  The two girls are acting suspicious removing clothing without looking at size style or price and taking multiples of each item Classic signs of shoplifting  The two girls eventually proceed into a female fitting room and my co worker goes to get ready to verify that they did not exit with the items and that the fitting room was empty  Now our store was two stories right in the middle of the mall and this fitting room was in the top story right near the exit into the mall  Sure enough the two girls exit not a single piece of clothing to be seen Stacy goes in verifies the stalls are empty and right at this time the girls are exiting  I tell Stacy that the STOP is good and to proceed  Now our LP office was on the other side of the store near the parking lot So I had to exit the office and proceed through the store to get to my co worker in case anything happened without running or causing a scene  As I am rounding the final corner at a fast walk I hear Stacy yelling HEY STOP COME BACK  I round the corner and out in the mall about  yards away I see Stacy with the baby stroller no suspects in sight  I run over and Stacy is standing there going They both ran opposite directions but I didnt go because theres actually a baby in here  Wat  They actually left a real live baby presumably one of theirs in the stroller when they ran  I told Stacy to call the cops bring the kid inside and take care of it and Id chase after one of them Stacy pointed the way of the food court and said The fat one went that way  Like a slightly overweight lion chasing after a gazelle the size of a hippo the chase was on  Now our company as do most have rules of when you can and cant engage a shop lifter and when you can and cant give chase  As with most stores if they go into the public parking lot you cant chase as its a liability  However in the mall we had a good standing so as long as they were in public mall space and I wasnt knocking old women and  year old out of the way I could chase them to my hearts content  At this point Suspect A who we shall name Queen Hippo had a  second head start  So But our mall was straight so I could see her waddling in the distance  I take off gaining ground trying to not run into anyone Mall security sees me and starts squaking on the radio  At one point I almost hit someone and end up stopping short and falling head first and sliding a short distance at which the phone kiosk guy yells HES SAFE to chuckles all around I admit I had a laugh too as I got myself up and took off runningAnyways I catch up with the girl right in the food court  As Im commanding her to stop she turns and starts attempting to swing at me  Fortunently for her the police who are always in the mall have been alerted and are right there so they grab her before I can  She starts yelling that I am chasing her tryna grab on her goodies and they should get dis white boy offa me  The cops naturally just look at me and say What have we got DrunkenBlackBelt  I tell them shoplifting pants and such  She of course continues to say she doesnt know what we are talking about and that Im tryna rape her  So thats when I drop the big bombshellOk we will get this sorted out but first we need to know The baby you abandoned is it yours or the other girls  The cops naturally have a look of WAT on their face  I explain the two girls left a baby behind and that  Stacy had it  The girl starts saying its her baby and that her friend said shed watch it while she ran from me tryna grab her goodies I explained that her friend took off too and left her baby there  She says she doesnt know what Im talking about and Im lying The cops naturally tell her to shut up and start dragging her back to our office  I radio Stacy en route let her know we are on our way back She informs me the kid is ok and we have Queen Hippos license in her purse so its even more proof  We get Queen Hippo back in the office cops search her we sit her down  Show the cops everything we have they interview Stacy to get her side with the baby who was like  months or so  So the cops sit down and explain to Queen Hippo that Department of Child Services are already going to be contacted for an investigation  But if she lied to them even once and didnt tell them everything then they would call them now to have the baby taken away within the hour  Naturally Queen Hippo broke down told us who her friend was who they were stealing for and even where they were fencing the goods they stole  Full on ORC info that was gold to us  Her friend was contacted and told to turn herself in by the end of the day or shell be charged with child endangerment as well  Queen Hippo had her kid taken away while they did the investigation Sorry no info about how that ended up we got our merch back a ton of ORC info got to play with a cute baby for an hour while the cops did their thing and a quick workout on my part  All in all a good day  TlDR I am a lion I just cant wait to be kingEdit Holy shit guys This post got very popular I will continue to post more and take request off any of my stories I named in my next post if people want  Also removed

claytoris,140,141,1dlx0r,718,I work at a grocery store We have this regular customer who comes in once a month and orders a pallet of flour which works out to fifty lb sacks The customer shows up several days late to pick up her order so it gets buried behind several stacks of empty pallets in our back roomThe customer comes in and is in a hurry as always Blocking her pallet is a stack of empty pallets  high as well as several bales of cardboard that are going to be picked up by our freight driver later in the afternoon I start to move the stack of bales and notice that  of the  wires have snapped and the boxes are falling apart on the bale in the middle I restring wires around the bale and attach it to the pallet on top of it so its all secure This takes about  minutes and requires the assistance of another employee Then I attempt to move the stack of  pallets with the power jack but upon shifting it slightly to the right the whole tower starts to lean and is going to crash through the wall I drop the stack quickly and it straightens out Okay Ill just use the forklift to separate the monster stack into two smaller stacksBy now my manager is calling me on the intercom to bring this stuff up to the front and I talk to her briefly to explain the situation She gives me shit but lets me get back to work She gives me shit about everything but always in a funny way Good boss that one I finally get the empty pallets out of the way and start to bring out this pallet of flour I get it almost out onto the sales floor when I notice that two of the bags have ripped wide open and flour is spilling everywhere Two of the bags on the BOTTOM of the pallet of course No way to get to those other than unloading EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BAG So I am sweating like a slave hucking bags of flour onto the floor I get the two broken bags and set them off to the side then restack the remaining  bags onto the pallet If I wasnt a strongman competitor in my spare time and reasonably strong this would have been even more miserablePallet loaded boss is screaming because customer is screaming and Im covered in sweat and flour as I make my way up to the front of the store Boss laughs at my appearance which actually calms my anger a bit I grabbed two bags of flour from their regular spot on the shelf to bring my pallet total back up to I follow the customer out to her car because Im the only jackass available for the carryout apparently and she opens up the hatch to thishttpmediacaranddrivercomimagesmediachevrolettraverseinteriorphotosxjpgBy now I had already assumed that she drove a tiny ass vehicle because fuck me thats whyI start loading bags into the back and she is playing armchair quarterback about the positioning of every bag I get about  bags into the back close the hatch because I think she has a second vehicle or some stupid fucking reason and then she says that whatever doesnt fit in the vehicle she will need to return back to the store for a refundWell hell noI open the hatch back up and start getting creative Years of Tetris have prepared me for this moment I manage to shove another  bags into every crevice I can find I stack the remaining  bags on the front passenger side And Ive got one bagOneBagI crawl into the drivers side and shove the massive stack around so I can stand up the last bag of flour behind her seat When I walk back through the front doors of my store with the empty pallet on the pallet jack I daydreamed that all my coworkers and managers would be there cheering for me and holding up YOU DID IT banners They werent of course but I felt victorious nonetheless ,The one where I shoved lbs of flour into a customers compact SUV,859

AWardLove,45,185,1ni9ng,695,If you have ever worked in the stock room of you store and are involved with digging into cardboard boxes you are probably familiar with the condition your forearms get after doing it for a long time If not you get raised red lines and every now and then an actual cut or two Its annoying but it looks worse than it actually feelsThis one day I was working at the bookstore and had been in the stock room for the entire morning sorting books out of their boxes into their appropriate sections I had been at this for at least  hours by this point I then got a call to be backup for one of the booksellers The customer was a really nice gentleman asking for a book in the Psychology department I look it up and then we go and locate it for him I reach up to grab the book for him hand it to him and ask if this is the one he was looking for He thanked me reached in his pocket and handed me his business card If you ever need somebody to talk to dont be afraid to call me There are other options out there and we can work through thisI look down at his card This gentleman was a therapist It then dawned on me as I realize that my shirt sleeves were rolled up from being hot while sorting exposing my beat up arms from the cardboard box I turned bright red and began to explain that these were not self inflicted wounds but from the cardboard boxes that I have been digging through all morning He seemed hesitant to believe me softly smiled and walked away I learned from that encounter that no matter how warm it is I make sure my arms are covered if I have to deal with customers while sorting boxes,If you ever need somebody to talk to,880

glitteryguineapigs,144,124,1dsyso,679,I just found this sub and would like to share my story  This is all  true  I worked at a very large retail chain all through high school usual big box store with clothes home goods prepared food and a pharmacy  I worked in the fitting room most of the time but was also cross trained for the various clothing departments and cashiering  Typically we had about  employees helping customers on the floor  cashiers a few people at customer service and a few managers  It being a relatively large store we all used walkie talkies and had various short hand for emergencies code yellow for a lost child code red for a fire etcOne fateful day I heard a flicker on my walkie talkieA fellow employee cool girl Carol I just I dont even I think we have a a Code Brown  This was uttered on the main frequency that goes through all walkies in the store we a have a secondary frequency for longer and more private conversationsCarol go to frequency  barked the manager of the eveningWhenever something juicy goes down in the store the manager and whatever employee brought up the issue go to the secondary line to discuss the matter in more detail  The rest of the employees are supposed to keep their walkies on frequency  for general matters what aisle are pillow cases inNeed more cashiers but many succumb to curiosity and check into frequency Manager Carol what are you talking aboutCarol In Aisle X theres just I think its poop  It is poop  Theres so much its everywhere I just dont evenManager What the fck  Ill be right overNaturally anyone who heard the quick conversation on frequency  dropped what they were doing and ran as fast as their little khakid legs would carry them to Aisle XLuckily I was on a break and not trapped behind the fitting room desk so I dashed to the scene of Code BrownI dont know what I was expectingFirst I smelled it  I saw Carols face ashen white with a thousandyard stare and then I saw it  Human diarrhea  All over an endcap in the make up aisle  It looked like someone filled a supersoaker with liquid shit and just sprayed all down the shelves creating a brown waterfall about  feet tall ending in a large semiliquid poop lake and topped off with a firm shit coil glacier floating regally in the center  The extraneous splatters wrapped around the whole corner of the endcap  So many dainty beauty products little tubes of lip gloss and smooth discs of powder and tiny brushes and mirrors small treasures I lusted over and would collect with the odds and ends of every paycheck now liberally coated in a dripping layer of human feces  At this time about  employees included the manager and assistant manager all just stood in silent reverence no one knowing exactly what to do or sayAt this time the lowly floor peons all shuffled around to one side and looked expectantly at the manager and assistant manager  They werent the worst bosses but the certainly werent the best and each had histories of stirring the pot playing favorites and general retailboss unfairness This is a biohazard  This is not in our job description  Ill help take apart the endcap and file damage reports but Im not touching shit  I am not paid enough to touch shit  Said one of the brave floor peons  We stood behind her in solidarity  The manager and assistant manager looked at each other  We were all quite queasy and pale in the face due to the stench at this point and the store still had several hours before we could close  So they had us block off the area with all the wetfloor signs in the store and put us all out to redirect the curious onlookers and onsmellers that began rubbernecking at the scene of the Code BrownThen we got to watch on as our prim assistant manager with her impeccable tan and expensive hair extensions and our manager mister big tough guy himself snap on some giant rubber gloves grab tens of rolls of paper towel many large trash bags and a few plastic dust pans and begin scooping the shit by the dust panfull into the bags  They were gagging and dryheaving so hard I could see tiny veins exploding in the whites of their eyes  After  hours of clean up and throwing away hundreds of dollars of make up and shelving we had a store meeting  Which consisted of all  closing employees sitting in silence staring at the ground for half an hour Several people threw up  We never found out who the Code Brown assailant was after our assets protection guy spent hours pouring over the security camera footage  Justice has never been served,Code Brown,803

Khole,125,172,1hsm9t,671,As mentioned in the title I work in a sex store A sex store in a downtown metropolitan area that is fully stocked to almost every customers wants and desires We sell dance stripper clothes lingerie platform shoes a wide variety of toys DVDs and have a booth area for customers to either insert bills by the minute for preloaded movies or pay a set price to select a DVD from our stockAs a shift manager I come in either midday or at night so I get to witness the full array of crazies drunk irate bitchy or occasionally absolutely awesome customers Expect me to be posting oftenToday I had a nice selection of irate  stories from a Saturday so this is going to get longI come in the store around midday and before the door even shuts behind me the opener well call him Jon starts telling me about a near assault that happened not even an hour priorA customer came in checked his bag and headed back to the pay booths and came up to turn his change in to  dollar bills About two minutes later he calls for Jon because he claims the machine ate his bills Jon says alright let me grab a dollar and Ill test it out note this is a common scam The customer starts yelling at Jon saying that Jon has worked here forever and knows the booths dont work Jon calmly explains that yes sometimes they do malfunction in which case we happily reimburse the customer but its customary to check the booth At this point the customer starts yelling and becoming increasingly aggressive Jon quickly heads back to the counter to be next to the cameras the phone and the giant mag light we have behind the register The customer runs up to the side and begins advancing up to the counter while calling Jon a peckerwood seriously Jon grabs the mag light as the customer is going at him with a large item in his hand Thankfully we have a slightly crazy cleaner that is in the store for about two hours every day that backs up Jon and the customer leaves The slightly crazy cleaner grabs the guys bag from behind the counter follows him out and throws it at himSo I get in hear the story and watch the video of the incident Alright its going to be one of those daysAbout  minutes later Im working on processing new inventory and Jon is calming down a little bit And then theres a bang on the windows Alright probably just a dumb kid walking by NBD  seconds later BANG I walk up to the windows and dont really see anyone go back to my business BANG I go outside and there is a  drunk man with serious crazy eyes holding a brown bag and punching our windowsHey Stop hitting our windowsThe  drunk crazy eye guy turns whats it to you He advances towards me the slight  manager of a sex store who decided to also advance because wtfI work here and stop hitting the fucking windowsOh you work here What the fuck are you going to do So at this point he is essentially standing on top of me and its kind of scary But also the police station is a block awaycall the cops for harassment being drunk and belligerent and possibly assault He high tailed it out of there pretty quickly but apparently he was hanging out in the alley an hour laterAfter that everything is going pretty smoothly Have a nice couple come in work on my project eat lunch And then a dancer walks in with a shoe box And this is the worst thing everWe do not do returns We only do exchanges for defective items This does not include shoes as some girls severely abuse their shoes or are only wanting to wear them with a specific outfit on a busy night The only cases in which we waive the policy is if the customer called within  hours of purchaseThe dancer bought a pair of the most expensive boots we have Black glittery thigh high platform boots running  I was there when she bought them the previous nightShe opens the box and shows me that the heel became detached from the platform and I say Im sorry but we are not taking them back She is mad and I dont care She yells at me for about ten minutes telling me she put them on and went on stage and got on the pole and they broke And I dont care and repeat the policy call the store managerSo I call her and explain the situation knowing that the answer will be a solid no The customer is yelling and a couple is staring I keep saying no and half saying sorry But they broke And youre going to put my money back on my cardNo Im not going to do that It is clearly posted that we do not do any returns at all and we dont do exchanges on shoes We have no proof that you did not dance in them and if you abuse your shoes its not our responsibilityIm going to file a complaint with the better business bureau I do this all the time And she smirksI realize that shes not going anywhere so I go back to my work and she starts making phone calls Putting on a nice voice and stating her location And then she just stands at the counterIm thanking her for saving me a phone callAs stated earlier the police station is down the street and they get here pretty fast One of the two officers Ive dealt with before hes a pretty nice guyHe gives me an are you fucking serious look and I hope my look conveyed hey I wouldnt call you for thisShe explains that we stole from her because were not refunding her money I explain that we have a strict noexchange policy on shoes is it clearly statedyes officer Above both shoe displays by the register twice and where you pick up your itemsBoth officers stare at her and now she claims she only tried them on The officer I havent dealt with before is left to explain that while it sucks she broke her shoe were under no obligation to refund her money as we have a very plainly stated policy and that she has the option to go to a shoe repair shopShe packs up her shoes in a hurry adds a few obscenities and is now in the banned book Both officers said I handled the situation really wellAlso I should note that I am probably the most forgiving person in the store with exchanges However it looked like she danced in the boots for a night and then tore the heel off I have never seen a natural one day heel break like that oneTLDR Near assault over two dollars  drunk guy in the middle of the day irate lying stripper calling the cops because she cant have her money back,Yes Officer the store policy is clearly stated adult store NSFW,843

Maevora,83,172,1j5j2a,660,I worked at a young womens clothing chain I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day Friday night but company rules said I had to open  days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldnt even see a customer until noon only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get talked to by our district manager frequentlyWell one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened maybe s I was  at the time He was a small guy but in good shape He was quiet but seemed like a sweet older guy He walked around the store for a while Bought a top he said was for his wife and left I didnt think much of it He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two Over time he became more talkative We would talk about things off topic a few times it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes Asking if his wife would like certain items He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc Didnt think anything of it Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lolI guess he became comfortable with me over time One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says Ok i have a confession As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife Most of it is for me I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction So I go Oh okwell then this is not a good shirt and continue to help him find clothes better suited to him I could literally see the relief in him He goes on to tell me that on the weekends him and his wife go out to the drag clubs and he dressed up They had a ton of fun doing it and how it had breathed life back into their failing marriage and brought them back together He told me how they went from being on the edge of divorce during his mid life crisis into a couple that couldnt take their hands off each other it was such a sweet story He thanked me profusely for being ok with what and who he was I told him I was proud of him for being himself and I was glad it was something him and his wife could enjoy together He was so happy because a few other stores shamed him and told him he could not go to their stores I told him he was always welcome at my store and He bought a few things and leftThe next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag He had brought in his wig his high heels his spanx and his bra that had fake boobies in it he wanted to see how things would look in his full get up He wanted to get there early so there was no chance of someone else coming in to use the fitting room I loved it It was so much fun I actually told him I was jealous because he looked better in the mini skirts than I did lol That day he ended up buying  worth of stuff which was our quota and I sold it in one transaction On top of that we got gift cards if we did transactions over  so I ended up making  that day DHe ended up being my best customer that year He came in almost every Wednesday The days he brought his whole get up he would be waiting outside my store at opening with his lil plastic bag About every other week he would drop sever hundred dollars Since Tuesday was our main shipment day there was always new stuff for him I will never forget him When it came time for me to leave he was devastated i was joining the military and he panicked because he didnt know if he would be able to buy his clothes Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her I told him to come in and meet her He reluctantly came in When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes OMG is this him Hi I am A I am so excited to meet you he kinda looks at me but responds to her She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along I knew he would be in good handsHe asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff The normal life stories and such He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin Weve lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him wont have to be ashamed of themselves So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded ltSummary Closed

ectopia,100,180,1j87fz,652,I originally posted this in rletsnotmeet and someone suggested I should post it here First off I work at an independent video store in a highly residential nuclearfamily infested neighbourhood We dont have any porn but we do have a lot of fancy shmancy Criterion movies and other critically acclaimed international titles that are hard to come by Most of our customers are regulars and a lot of them have been coming to our store for  years I am a petite girly blonde in my midtwenties I love movies and I love my job  but it doesnt pay extremely wellThis particular encounter happened roughly two years ago It was during the summer so a few of my coworkers were on vacation and I had taken as many extra shifts as I possibly could working somewhere between  hours a week My mother lived within short walking distance from the store so I didnt have a problem taking a few closing shifts at the time The store is pretty small so I always ended up closing aloneThis all happened at about pm half an hour before closing time This guy stomps into the store dressed in baggy black clothing I remember noticing him because he legit looked like Xzibit Anyways he comes in and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blurays Our shelves arent very tall so I can see his head poking through I go back to work and fifteen minutes later I realize that were the only two people left in the store and that hes still in the exact same spot in the bluray section staring at me Im a little startled but I stare back until he looks away Closing time is fast approaching so I decide to go talk to him see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whateverWhen I finally approach him I immediately notice that he looks like hes about to piss his pants He looks crazy anxious His eyes are darting all over the room I give him my usual speech tell him I have to lock the door in less than five minutes and offer to help him choose something quickly He stammers something along the lines of oh i uh shes the one who sent me here she wanted something funny i never shes it wont take me long I notice that he keeps playing with what I assume to be his belt I cant see what hes doing because of his long baggy tshirt but I know hes playing with something at the back of his pants at waist level I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon and that hes planning a holdupI do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter I have the strength of a wet noodle so I had no intention of trying to be a hero I was going to give him everything in the register but I knew hed probably be disappointed by how little was in there no more than  Unfortunately my boss hadnt deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldnt ask me to open it Because it isnt actually visible I figured there was a chance he didnt know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirelyFinally he starts walking towards the counter and says hes not going to rent anything I was doing my best to look busy all while keeping him in my peripheral He stopped about a foot in front of the counter directly in front of me I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank I looked at it expecting to see a gun or a knife Thankfully it was just his penis Just an average semihard penis I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routineThe flasher seemed confused by my reaction and I guess he thought I didnt look at it because he began contorting his body so his dick was in better view trying to get my attention by saying random shit like uh so uhhh Im leaving uh goodnight then So I looked up at him looked back down at his dick and said Yeah whatever He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietlyI called the cops but nothing much happened They had me look at some mugshots but none of them looked anything like Xzibit I figured Id probably never see this guy again because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didnt get him fully hard WrongTwo months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday The flasher staggers in still wearing baggy clothes but this time everything is bright yellow He comes up to the counter and starts awkwardly trying to chat me up he points to the red writing on his blindingly yellow baseball cap and says Hey Mama see this Whats it say I totally cant help sideeyeing him as I answer Draid he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles Yeah girl thats my name Whats yours I lie and say my name is Deborah Do you work here a lot DebAt this point I dont feel like playing along anymore so I do my best to sound as tough as I possibly can Why the FUCK do you want to know his smile instantly fades and he begins to stammer and he proceeds to give me possibly the most absurd explanation I have ever heard Oh uh well uh ysee I um I have this TWIN brother and like hes kind of shady and like he said he comes here a lot so uh if he ever did anything shady in your store um like I wouldnt want you to think it was me cuz Im not shady but my TWIN is I think I actually snorted Alright Draid whatever I do work here a fair amount and its possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didnt make much of an impression He seemed disappointed by this shrugged and said Oh Ok Well uh thats good and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the storeOnce more I stupidly assumed that would be my last encounter with him I wanted him to think that he hadnt left an impression on me since he clearly gets off on shocking people I thought that by telling him that I didnt remember him hed be discouraged Sadly he had more of a Challenge Accepted attitudeI didnt work night shifts for a good six months after this but when I finally took one as a favour to a coworker yeah Flasher shows up I was already having a pretty shitty night so by the time he entered the store I was already in a sour moodHe walks in wearing his allblack outfit has a big grin on his face and turns to me and says Hey girl Remember me I was pissed I could barely conceal my anger when I answered Why would I he seemed to lose some of his initial confidence and blurted oh guess I got the wrong girlHe goes back to the same corner as he did the first time peeking at me over the shelves from the back of the store My cheeks were burning with rage It really pissed me off that this guy kept coming back that the cops would do pretty much nothing about it since hed totally have time to run away before they got here and that my fucking boss STILL hadnt installed security cameras All he did was give me a beatdown stick its a heavy wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handleI knew from experience that hed still be staring at me so I looked up and made eyecontact I glared at him Since acting indifferent didnt work I took a different approach I wanted to scare the fuck out of him I yelled at him from across the store WHAT DO YOU WANT YOURE STARING AT ME DO YOU NEED HELP YOU KEEP STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING he began to shake his head NO YOU DONT NEED ANYTHING YOU SURE YOURE STILL STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING he shook his head some more ALRIGHT WELL IF YOU DONT NEED ANYTHING STOP STARING AT ME his head shot downI pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat I still wanted to scare him but I was aware that being a petite little blond girl in a pink sequin dress didnt make me look like much of a threat So I decided to make myself look like a crazy maniac Before he came in the store I was watching Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia so I figured I would just pretend to keep my attention on the show all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it I started yelling at the screen like HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry and waved the beatdown stick a few times It took about ten minutes but yeah he ran out of the store FASTSo yeah I havent seen him since and I really hope I dont either cause fuck I am out of ideas now,and he never offered to pimp my ride  long,832
Twitchh,113,128,1ag2xx,655,I used to work for a blue shirt electronics store in the cell phone department After a few years I decided to move on to better opportunities more money and put in my two week notice This occurred about one week into my two week notice Its fifteen minutes after closing and Im inside the counter area cleaning up and putting away merchandise general I want to go the fuck home type activities when this large woman walks up and plops two prepaid phones on the counter without saying a word I notice her after a few seconds and ask would you like to purchase those She sarcastically replies with no I just put them up here to look at Fine I can see how this is gonna go so I just decide to zip my lip and complete the transaction I get to the total and tell her what she owes and she tosses her credit card on the counter Now Im annoyed because shes just being disrespectful But I again bite my tongue and dont say a word I finish up the transaction put her phones and receipt in the bag and hand it to her without saying a word She snatches the bag out of my hand and says you aint even gonna tell me to have a nice day Youre rude At this point I lost it I tried to stay professional throughout and she just went one step too far so I left her have it I figured Ive only got a few days left what are they gonna do fire meI look at her and let it fly No Im not going to tell you to have a nice day You walk up here fifteen minutes after we close drop your shit on the counter and give me a smart ass remark when I ask a simple question Then you have the audacity to toss your credit card at me like Im your bitch After all the your expect me to tell you to have a nice day Nope I wont In fact I hope your day sucks In fact I hope you have a crappy weekend ByeIll never forget the look of shameanger on her face She couldnt even muster up a response she just huffed away and I went back to work Apparently she went and found a manager to complain about me because I saw her leave  minutes later and the manager on duty came over to reprimand me for my behavior but as soon as she cleared the exit door he bust out laughing He told me he saw the while thing and just let it go because she had it coming She probably thinks she won because I was gone after that week but at least shell think twice next time TLDR Wrong person wrong time fuck you lady ,Dont be rude to me after Ive already put in my two week notice,783

DrunkenBlackBelt,177,233,15q63n,651,Hello on and all  I hope you are all having a wonderful day I certainly am seeing as my Redskins won the big game last night HTTR  So being in a chipper mood I figure I can share some laughs with everyone here  Fair warning if you are sensitive about religious topics specifically Atheism this story might not be for you  So today I bring youReligious Hypocrisy AboundSo its another fine day working for Doodoocrombie amp Mitch  Im floating between stores coaching associates doing my LP thing  Eventually I end up at the Follistar brand store and am in the back going over paperwork investigating money shortages weve been having  I have the stores cameras up in front of me and from time to time I am taking sharp eagle eyed glances at them to make sure one of the mannequins didnt fall over  It was dead It was beyond dead It was deader than Bambis mom after hunting seasonToo soonAnyways in walks this family  A mother pushing a baby stroller and three sons ages roughly around  and   Nothing really drew my attention to them but being the only people in the store I figure I should watch them The older guy and the  year old sit in the chairs in the front of the store just chilling while the mom and  year old go into the store  The  year old pics out a nice pink and white checkered button up shirt and a few other flannels  His mom has him try them on and after seeing they fit she points to another room and he goes walking  off Thats when I see the mother take the  shirts bundle them up and stuff them under the baby strollerFantasticNow the normal downside to this would be that since Im watching her on camera I cant go from the camera room in the back to the sales floor without losing sight of the shoplifter  If that happened then I technically wouldnt be able to make a stop as I couldnt  testify that they definitely did not ditch the stolen merchandise  Luckily for me she happened to be in the room right next to the door that leads to the back room So I called a manager and was able to get onto the floor quickly enough to ensure that she didnt ditch the stolen items  My cover was obviously blown so I just played the part of a manager and me and the other manager just walked around talking about this and that in the store Meanwhile we discreetly followed to the woman  Sure enough she leaves the store and I make my stop  I identify myself and ask her to come with me  Im blocking the exit for strollers so this woman just says No and starts trying to push her stroller with a baby up the stairs to exit Im trying to block her progress but also dont want to risk injury to the baby  The older male starts asking me what is going on and not wanting to embarrass the woman I just say She has some of my merchandise and I need her to pay for it  Something about the look in his face told me he was semi aware of what was going on but not a part of it  The  year old started yelling at me to stop trying to hurt his mom  I told my manager to call the cops The woman kept shouting I didnt do anything Im a good christian and pushing the baby stroller WITH THE BABY IN IT into my shins and thighs trying to get past meNow I loved my LP jobs and I took them seriously but I would never do anything to risk a childs health Fuck that its not worth it So I calmly said while walking next to her into the mall Mam Im not gonna stand in your way because if youre willing to risk your childs health to get away Im not going to be a part of that risk But I dont care if I have to follow you to your car get your plates and have the police follow up Im getting my merchandise back and you will have to deal with all that followsShe just kept dipping and dodging trying to walk away and shouting GET AWAY IM A GOOD CHRISTIAN I DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT  The older male just kind of follow shaking his head He was a lot bigger than I was Im big but he was close to  tall and had at least  lbs on me  But so far he wasnt threatening The  year old on the other hand kept trying to run interference  I would just walk around him and keep pace with the mom  At this point the mother is shouting IF YOU DONT STOP FOLLOWING ME IM CALLING THE COPS to which I replied Im already on the phone with the cops  I dialed them up and they had my managers call before and I was detailing to the dispatcher where we were in the mall at that time Every time I gave a location and direction the woman would turn and go another way  It was a game of cat and mouse wherein the cat couldnt run and the mouse had down syndromeWho will win you ask Well naturally it was me  Eventually the  year old decided Well I can take him  and decided to step in front of me push me then take a swing  NOPE  So we are on the ground the woman is screaming and the older guy is standing over me as Im holding his brother on the ground  I tell them to get back  Luckily the older guy had a cool head on his shoulders and decided to step between the woman and I and keep her from jumping on me  Just then the cops arrived a whole  minutes after all of this nonsense began  The cops cuffed the young boy and led the mother and him back to the store  Once inside we got everyone separated and began to talk  The woman is in tears just saying Im a good person Im a good Christian  The young kid is staring daggers at me  The cops ask me if I want to press assault charges  I look at him and at the mother I cant tell you why I did what I did I can only tell you that I am an amazing kind and obviously humble person Maybe even the greatest person who ever lived  I told the cops not to press charges  That he thought I was harassing his mom and when he stepped in front of me we ran into each other and I took it as a hands on thing when he pushed I didnt tell them about the punch  I think the cops knew but realized I didnt want to put this poor kid through a trial when he was defending his mom  Yes I am an amazing person with a trivial act of kindness That means more Karma right Reddit  Upvote me damnitOk enough sarcasm  We recover the shirts from the baby stroller and have the older male take the baby and the  year old outside to wait    The mother has calmed down enough and keeps saying thank you Thank you  We start to question her and she explains that tomorrow is picture day at school and her older son is the only one who works in the family So they are struggling She wanted her boy to have nice clothes and this is the only way to get them right now  She looks at me and saysGood Christian Woman  Thank you for not pressing charges on my son He was just protecting me They dont know I do this Im ashamed  But thank you for understanding and not making problems for him  Please tell me what Church you go to and Ill gladly make a donation as a thank youMe  I understand He just thought I was harassing you for no reason Any good son would have done the same But save your money Mam  You obviously need it and besides Im an Atheist so theres no church to donate too  But its a sweet sentimentNow I dont think that I have the words to properly convey the look that came across this womans face It was some sort of mixture between confusion disgust revulsion and incomprehension  It honestly looked like I had just told her that if you kick a puppy through a field goal post youll find a pot of gold where it lands  Yes that is an awful image and I love dogs but imagine the look on your face if someone told you that in all seriousness and thats how this woman looked GCW AnAtheist  But youre obviously a good person You were kind to my son  How are you not ChristianM Well thats a whole debate about whether you need religion to be moral butGCW You do You cant be moral without God  M Mam Im not going to get into a philosophical debate here  GCW But your godless  Youre false  M False  Like I dont exist Im afraid I dont followGCW Thats why I came in here  Satan was working through you and I fell for his tricks and stoleMGCW How can you trust SatanM Mam I dont believe in Satan  It kinda goes with the whole Atheist thingNow this was even more shocking to hear for her  I guess she assumed that all atheist were devil worshipers because logic  Meanwhile the cop is sitting there just kinda of watching this  I keep trying to get out of the situation but she keeps wanting to refocus on saving meGCW  I can help you  If you let me just help you Read the bible I have so many I can give you one Just open up to itM Mam for the last time I dont want to discuss this  I have read the Bible I have read several books of the Apocrypha Ive read the Quran Book of Mormon Dhammapadda and parts of several other religious texts from various religions and belief systems  Its not an issue of ignorance  But that is not why we are here We are almost done if you just let us finish our paperwork the officer here is going to release you on a PTA and youll be free to goGCW YOU NEED JESUSAnd thats when I snapped  I can tolerate religious talk and honestly even enjoy open discussions about various faiths and beliefs  But a man can only take so muchM Well if I WAS going to take religious guidance I probably wouldnt take it from someone who cant even follow one of the top  rules of their religion I decided to accent this point by holding up the shirts she had just stolen  HypocriteGWC decided this was a good point to shut up and start scowling at me  The officer shot me a look and we continued our paperwork before walking her out  The officer was gonna walk with them and escort them off the property  The GWC and her two younger sons were glaring at me the whole time like I had just literally punt kicked a puppy over a field goal post  The older son looked upset but was still very quiet other than saying Sorry about this  GCW packed up the carriage and said Come on boys Before this false man perverts us even moreNaturally I just said Have a good dayTLDR Matthew  Judge not that you be not judged For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you Why do you see the speck that is in your brothers eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye Or how can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye when there is the log in your own eye You hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to

vlnplyr,221,132,1bqlpk,649,Hello TFR  Several years back I worked at a grocery store which now has been forced to close many of its stores  At the time I worked at the customer service counter where we cashed checks did money orders sold cigarettes videos and other goods etc  Id dealt with my fair share of fake bills scam artists etc but the worst experience I had came from a coworkerThe store had recently hired on a lossprevention lady since our theft was a bit out of control due to the neighborhood where the store was situated  Well after a couple months speaking to her in passing etc she came in on her day off to collect her paycheck  She patiently waited in line so she could cash it and I commented that she looked very incognito that day due to her coming to work in street clothes on her day off  I cash her check and away she goesProbably  minutes later Im called by the store director to come to his office  I have someone cover for me and away I go having no clue why Im being summoned  I walk in and theres my store director at his desk with the lossprevention girl sitting across from him along with another empty chair next to her  Have a seat he saysI sit down thinking oh crap they think I stole something  The store director opens with the usual political crap about something we need to discuss  He turns it over to her so she can make her statement  She says that while I was cashing her check I said something about incognegro or something of the sort  I was FURIOUS  I quickly stood up and started toward the door completely disgusted with not only the situation but that I would be accused of something like that  You see not only was the lossprevention lady black but the store director was tooHe stopped me before I got to the door and basically said If you leave I cant help you  In my rage I turned around and looked right at her and said I said INCOGNITO  How can you not know what that means  Get a dictionary or something  I then looked at the store director and told him that I couldnt believe what was happening and that I had ALWAYS treated him with respect and that we had a great working relationshipAfter that he asked her to leave the room and told me that she had already made several other accusations against people in the store  She was let go a couple months later for failing to produce any sort of change as it related to theftFrankly Ive never been so insulted in my life  Hope nobody is ever put in this situation either especially by a coworker,Apparently Im a Racist,781

allyourbasekris,63,111,19h7zl,648,So I used to be an assistant manager in a computer game retailer in the UK Our policy at the time was exchange or gift card only on PC titles but wed refund or exchange unopened console games for cash We also had a points scheme that would mail out vouchers to our loyalty card holders this is importantSo it transpired that our store and several other of our stores in the area were getting hit by a group of scammers whod buy a console game remove the shrinkwrapping steal the game out of the box and then rewrap the game with a shrinkwrapper using padding of some sort to make the game feel like the correct weightThey always used to hit stores at the busiest times and always had a receipt so management used to authorise these without any further thought to actually checking if the game was actually in the case Stupid I knowSo after losing several games in our store to this scam we were being a bit more wary of returns especially shrinkwrapped games coming in at busy times so we had a customer come in with a copy of GTA IV which had only been released a few days earlier wanting a refund it was insanely busy so the manager took it in without checking on behalf of one of our new staff refunds the customer and thinks nothing of itWell it turned out that wed been caught out again with the scam The  case had no game in it but the thief being a total genius had stuffed it with one of our loyalty card letters we send out probably trying to be cleverHe wasnt that clever though the big problem with using our literature for this is that not only did it have his loyalty card number at the top of the letter IT ALSO HAD HIS FULL NAME AND ADDRESS written on the topApparently corporate took him to court over this and the lad couldnt understand how hed been caught out,Shrinkwrap Scam Fail,759
WorriedWorm,196,290,1iwe9t,646,I just up and quit I had tried everything I have talked to corporate I had proof and nothing was done I got the job when I was  the manager who hired me was my mentor he served as a father figure in my life I worked hard for years getting promotions and pleasing the customers Our store was run well the store manager was a reasonable man and was best friends with the mens department manager my manager the employees here were intelligent and fun to be around We were the highest selling store in our state It was a magical place to work I loved every minute of itA year ago I was offered a promotion to manager Housewares needed a new manager and I was the one they wanted to run the Department For the longest time I was a Supervisor I was the young reasonable guy everyone loved Being offered the promotion was the happiest day of my life no joke I was overwhelmed and had a lot of anxiety over this but everything worked outAs manager I began noticing how different management was to being a lowly worker Lot of drama and the worst corruption I noticed one day as I was talking to the textiles manager as he was ringing someone out he was giving that person a massive discount What That cant be right  off The item was  off I confront him and he plays dumb saying it was a mistake I believe him I do because I trust the people working here But Im still suspicious The next day Im returning something to textiles when i see him again with the same customer giving him a massive discountI confront him again He just shrugs and tells me Does it really matter Just another perk of being manager I go up to Rick our Store manager and tell him what I saw I show him proof and he just sighs and leans forward and tells me A manager is allowed to give out discounts You didnt know Thats fine but if you wanna hand out discounts dont make it so obvious I sit there my mouth agape looking at him like he lost his mind sir I say Sir thats against corporate policy isnt it he looks at me and his eyes narrow If you want to keep your job here dont think so hard about thisI storm out and go to find Alan Alan was the one who hired me he is my mentor and like a father to me he was the smartest man i knew the hardest working a real stand up guy he would know what to do I go to his office He looks up from his computer hey Dean whats going on Need something so i calmly explain what i saw and heard Alan sighs and motions for me to sit Its best if you ignore this I dont much agree with this but the right thing to do is to mind your own business If Rick says its okay then its okay Now youve done a darn fine job here Dont ruin your career here Im stunned the Alan i knew would never say this to me the Alan I knew would never turn a blind eye to these shady dealings Theres no feeling quite like knowing the guy you idolized turns out to be just as bad as the rest I went home early that day I needed to decide what to doI decided to not do anything yet Days went by and I got the distinct feeling I was not very wanted hereThe aura in that store had changed Managers would glare at me and I just felt unwanted But I trucked on there was nothing to do About a couple weeks ago I was returning a shirt to womens when i caught a new hire Tamara removing the tags from a blouse and placing the item into a bag without paying I confronted her and she denied everything but I saw and dragged her to my office I was giving her a lecture preparing to fire her when the door opened and the womens dresses manager Amy barged in and claimed she would handle this I think ok its her employee and a a close friend of hers shell handle this I go back to my department I then see Tamara coming out of the offices and heading back to her department She wasnt fired I go to Ricks office and ask him whats going on Rick She had a minor lapse in judgement Everything has been fixed no harm done Its over and done with he harshly explained Again I was wrong about this store i was wrong about everythingThat night at closing I was taking the trash out when I was closing mostly everyone had gone home and I had just finished my cash drops I was walking out when I saw Alan in the womens department taking the sectags off the items and putting them in a bag He must have a dozen shirts in there he hadnt paid I followed him out the store and there was a car waitingAlans wife was in said car She spotted me and waved Alan turned around and came up to me I was the first to speak You didnt pay for those clothes did you and so Alan looks at melooks me dead in the eye and says No But I can and will pay at later date There was no harm done I grow red No harm done This is against the policy this is theft pure and simple I have to report this he puts hs hand on my shoulder Son I got you this job and with  word I can get you fired We going to have a problem and then he walked off and got into her car and left That was the final straw I felt so betrayed by Alan and this store How could they be this blatant about their stealing I had proof they were so the next day i went to LP The LP manager Arnold was not the most pleasant of people to be around he was egoistical and not very good at his job his LP agents werent much better I tell him what I saw and ask if he can replay the videos GotchaArnold looks over to me and tells me So oleAlan is stealing eh Who cares you arent going to use me as a witness because I trust oleAlan hes a good man Corporate will not care and your job is on the line Just sayin I ignore him and walk out During break I contact corporate I contact the Regional Manager and to my surprise he is willing to do an investigation The next day Im called into Ricks office sitting in Ricks chair is a man in a suit I had never seen before RM had to be and in front of him Alan The man introduces himself as Todd and says he was contacted here by a concerned manager that we had a theft problem I explained to him what I saw and what had been going on Todd asked Alan and Alan defends himself and then finally deflects this onto me and attacks my characterTodd smiles and says he think he sees the issue here he says hes looked around and thinks the issue is Im not able to do my job he recommends that I not be placed in any leadership position He gets up and shakes our hands Rick is furious and Alan is smiling Rick looks down at me Should have minded your business I should fire you but I wont because truth be told youre a valuable employee but your time as a manager is over he boasted I get up and walk out Rick yells at me I tell him all that needs to be said Im done I quit As Im walking out Alan grabs my shoulder Son rethink what you just said You spent  years hereyou arent going to be able to use us as a reference Think about what youre doing nope I dont care I throw my badge on the ground and walk out the front door years  years gone I could have stayed but whats the point,Quit my job after  years working there after discovering the store management was corrupt,936

backwardswithtime,161,211,1cexm5,636,So the set up sorry for the length Ive been lurking for a while and finally decided to post this I work in a big chain grocery store as a meat cutter to pay my way through university Now I pride myself on my customer service I am honest if a person wants my opinion on an item or I see them picking a low quality cut I will tell them its crap and give them a better option Management does not really like this but I remind them that our job is to provide exceptional customer service and I am not going to lie to a customer just so their profits go up a by a few bucks Regardless I have a lot of customers who love me and I have gotten a large number of positive reviews from customers who phone in to the corporate office to tell them about the good job Ive done Basically I dont put up with crap If it is within my power I will help someone the way I would want to be helped And if they are asshats I dont put up with it So here is where the story gets funAbout two years ago I was doing my cleanup this involves foaming the whole department walls tables floor saw with a very powerful and toxic if ingested soap A customer came up to the counter and asked my to cut up the whole fryer chicken she had into parts Normally I would have been happy to oblige but since the tables were covered in this foam I told her that I was unable to She then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to do this to which I told her that it was my job to also not poison her She did not find that funny She demanded that I cut the chicken for her I pointed to the foam covering the department and repeated that I could not without getting her and anyone who eats the chicken very sick Well that was just not good enough She lost it Its your job You have to do this all the typical bullshit that over privileged customers scream at us lowly customer service folks So what do I do I laugh at her tell her Im not going to help her and that she can go talk to a manager I turn my back to her as she storms off to complainOf course the manager comes flying up to me and asks what happened I pointed out the toxic chemicals and said that I was unable to cut the bird for her and I was not going to put up with being screamed at by a customer for not making her sick So he goes gives her a heaping amount of gift cards and sends her on her way And from there I thought it was over but not by a long shot Apparently she called the regional corporate office the next day to complain about me The complaint made its way up the chain to the district manager Now this guy is a complete asshole but we have always been cordial towards one another and he appreciated the outstanding customer service I have regularly provide I show up for my next shift the following weekend and the district manager and the rest of the store managers are waiting for me I get called into the office and asked what the hell happened I tell them about the customer and then proceed to get chewed out by all the managers you have to do what she asks customer service blah blah blah During this I am just sitting in the chair smiling and listening Once they are done I look at them and said something to the effect of okay sure Ill cut the chicken next time but I have a question for you Would you guys like a multimillion dollar lawsuit on your hands because Im fairly sure poisoning a customer is a good way to go about getting one I understand where you are coming from but I have never provided poor customer service and as far as I am concerned I saved this company millions of dollars and a heck of a lot of embarrassment So next time if I am getting you guys Ill go ahead and poison her Whos contact info should I give out to her when she wants to sue Everyone went silent A lot of mumbling and repeating stuff about customer service ensued until they were done at which point I thanked all the managers by name for their time and went to go do my job I never heard a word about it again and thanked my lucky stars that I was a union member so I could not get fired for insubordination   ,Customer was pissed that I would not poison her,847

it would be fun to try and grabngo with it or use fake IDs or get someone else to buy it for them and it was a constant battle against them in order to keep from getting fired or possibly arrested  Everyone in town knew I was a stickler for the rules  This guy however tried anywayA car drives in and parks right in front of the store  I can see out our full glass door into the car it has two guys in front and two girls in back  The passenger gets out walks in and heads straight for the beer cooler  Great Im going to have to deal with this  He gets his cell phone out and makes a call  I can see the driver answer HIS phone and its pretty obvious that they are conversing back and forth  So the guy in the store lets call him Sergei comes up to the register with a halfrack of Coors Light a sixpack of Bridgeport and two sixpacks of Mikes Hard Lemonade  Oh boySir Im going to need to see your IDHe begins reaching for his walletand the IDs for everyone in the carOregon has a shouldertapping law  This means that if you park in front of my store with multiple people in the car and come in to get beer I have to see EVERYONES ID or else I could get fined about  and potentially charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor  This of course does not sit well with Sergei  He first insists that they are all   Doesnt matter still have to see ID  He then insists that all the beer is for him  Doesnt matter still have to see ID  Then he complains that other cashiers have done it for him yeah right  Doesnt matter still need to see IDNow Sergeis gone from beggingjoking to angry  He starts rambling on about how he knows the owner and the owner would do it for him  Dude did you not hear me the last four times  It doesnt matter I still need to see ID  Plus since the owner was the one who gave the cashiers their OLCC training because hes certified to do so I highly doubt it  Finally Sergei DEMANDS that I call the owner at home and get him down to the station to clear this upNo  Just no  Im not calling the owner a very nice man who respected his employees and treated them well at pm just to interrupt his family time have him drive  minutes down to the station just so he call tell you youre an idiot and kick you out  I like the owner  And before you ask no Im not calling the general manager or any of the assistant managers  Im in charge right now and before I sell you this I Need To See IDBut Sergeis heels are firmly dug into the ground like a cartoon donkey  Hes gone into the repeat the same thing over and over again bit telling me to call the owner  Alright Ive had enough of this  I intercomm one of the other employees to come in and cover the register and tell Sergei Im going to make a call  FINALLY JUST DO WHAT I ASK he bellows  Oh my friend thats not quite the caseYes there was a phone next to the register  But to be honest I wanted this to be a surprise so I went into the back room  Instead of calling the owner I called you guessed it the local constabulary  Would you be so kind as to send over one of your fine officers to deal with a young rapscallion whos attempting to purchase intoxicating beverages with the intent to distribute them to potential minors  You would  Oh marvelous see you soonI come back out of the stock room and tell Sergei that someone will be here soon just wait around for a few minutes  He throws his hands in the air in disgust walks outside and lights up a cigarette  Sadly he was facing away from me when the police car rolled up and parked behind his car so I couldnt see his facial expression  Mores the pity Im sure it was pricelessThe officer steps out greets Sergei and asks the driver and two girls to step out  He then ushers all four of them inside  The girls look nervous the driver looks pissed and Sergei looks in shock  I manage to keep a victory grin from spreading across my face  An effort of will that was let me tell youThe officer then asks why he got called down here on a complaint that someone was trying to buy beer without showing ID  Sergei counters saying he DID show me ID  The officer then looks at me  No he never actually did  And he never got ID for the people in the car  Sergei denies being in the car  I saw your car park you get out of the passengers seat come inside and call the driver sir  You definitely came in the car  Sergei then gets angry calls me a liar and was probably thinking of trying to come over the counter at me when the officer calls it all to a halt  How about this ladies and gentlemen  Let me see everyones IDThey all very reluctantly pull out IDs  Sergei is   The driver is   Girl  is   Girl  is   UhohSo the entire troupe is herded back outside and another couple of units arrive  The first officer asks if I can call the assistant manager that only lives a few blocks away so that they can look at surveillance footage  No problem that AM is the one Im in classes with hed love to help out an investigation  I give him a quick call and hes at the station within  minutes  He and the officer go into the back room and watch the tape  The beer is slowly getting warm on the counter  Im getting boredThe officer comes back out shakes my hand and thanks me for calling this in  He then goes outside and promptly arrests both Sergei and the driver  Neither are very happy about it but dont put up any sort of fight just shouting and vague threats towards me and the stationThe girls were the icing on the justice cake  The officer made them call their parents so they could be picked up and then made them explain exactly WHY they had been called late at night to a gas station with police officers there  Nothing deters future criminal activity like the Im very disappointed in you speech  That victory grin was now next to impossible to suppressFinally its all over  My AM wrote out a note for the GM to review the tapes in the morning thanked me for giving him something to do that evening and left  The next day I had a  gas card and a nice little note in my employee file  Never heard from Sergei or his friend againTLDR  Free gas  For like three weeks,No Im not going to call the owner at home or doing illegal things in front of me isnt smart,757

McKernanx,71,126,1bnss8,608,Im sorry if this is a little long but i find it to be a fairly entertaining story to tell so i thought some of you would enjoy itI used to work a tech support desk at a big electronics retailer Part of our job there was to handle service plan claims which involved testing the item and then shipping it to the service center We would always warn people that if the item came back with a no fault found diagnosis the customer then had to pay  to get the item back We even had said customers sign a disclaimer to this effect Still every time an item came back NFF we would get a large argument This is why we insisted on testing EVERY SINGLE ITEM thoroughly before sending it out that way we could verify that yes indeed there was a problem Most of the time however when we couldnt verify the problem the customer would still insist that we send it outOn top of the normal daily arguments we would get this one particular instance sticks out in my mind mainly because i walked away with a injury and ended up sending a guy to prison for it This particular customer i will call him Bob from here on out had dropped off his DVDVCR combo about a week before claiming that it did not work At the counter it was tested but the Bob wouldnt even describe a problem just saying that it didnt work over and over We plugged it in played both disks and VHS tapes and even recorded to VHS for him just to prove that it did in fact work With no additional details given though he still insisted that it didnt work and that we needed to send it out So we did in fact send it out for him sighting the issue as client states unit does not function Could not verify issue at store and we made him sign a disclaimer saying exactly that and spent the better part of  minutes explaining to him that ifwhen the item comes back NFF he would have to pay the fee to pick it up Of course Bob agreed verbally and in writing so i though that we were at least relatively safeFast forward one week The DVDVCR had been received that morning and Bob had been called to come pick it up and reminded that he would in fact need to pay the  to pick the item up as they could not find a single problem with the device in question This night it was myself and one other associate we shall call him Dave who happened to be working the counter when Bob walked in Dave greeted Bob fairly nicely and took his receipt and went and found the device He then informed Bob yet again that the item came back with NFF and is in fact working exactly as it is supposed to He even offered to test it again for Bob to show him He then reminded Bob about the  NFF fee that had to be paid for us to release the item Of course Bob was appalled What  Im not paying that shit You fixed it and now you want to claim that it was never broke just to get my money Dave went back and forth with him for a few minutes and then walked away from the counter to call a manager Unfortunately he left the DVDVCR sitting on the counter well with in the customers reachI spotted this and i also spotted Bob reach out put his hands on the unit and peer in to see if we were watching I quickly reacted walked over and put my hands on the item hoping i had caught it before Bob had fully formed the idea to run I greeted Bob nicely and then tried to diffuse the situation explaining the  again and also reminding him that i was the one that tested the item for him originally and it clearly worked here at the counter Unfortunately he was not going to back down on this issue Bob starts to yell that he wants his unit and that i cant keep it from him He yells that i cant keep his product from him He also yells lots of obscenities at me While this was going on i move to pick up the unit and move it off the front counter out of Bobs reach Unfortunately for me i was a little too slow Bobs ninja like hands dart out and grab hold of the other end of the device attempting to pull it from my grip I refuse to let go telling him that as of this moment that device is the property of The store and that i cant release it to him He yells to give it to him and i tell him again that i would be happy to if he would simply pay the  fee Bob did not like this and decided that i was serious about not letting go so his hands quickly let go of the unitUnfortunately after letting go Bob was left with a boiling anger and a lack of something to do with his hands So of course he did the only logical thing with them that he could think of and reached out for my neck Here i am being strangled over a counter by a  foot tall  something man and all i could do was yell out Luckily the guy working at the LP desk was close enough to run over and tackle old Bob to the groundYou can guess the next few bits what with the management the cops the reports court etc The best part was before the police would take him out of the store they dragged him over to the counter and made him pay the  Turns out that Bob was out on

FayzerDayzer,63,123,1jyvcr,612,This is not a story of my own experience but of my graveyard manager at a twenty four hour diner Background not really important Ive worked with Jess for a little over a year now She knows all the tricks takes care of every situation like a BOSS and would rather send someone with a bad attitude packing than encourage them to return She also gets hit on a lot by the night time customers because of her words her ghetto booty The Tale As Jess walked past the counter to deliver food a male customer locks eyes on her butt and says with no attempt at being subtle Damn girl Jess ignores him The incident repeated itself a few moments later as she returned the tray to the kitchen window but Jess ignored him again The customer seeming to realize that his attempt at flirting  was futile went up to pay Jess didnt want any of the servers to have to put up with this guy and went to cash him out herself He pulled a  dollar bill from his wallet despite having lower denominations in which to pay for his meal Jess per policy held the bill up to the light The customer huffed Thats offensive  Jess popped the drawer open placed his change on the counter and stared him straight in the face before responding So are you She turned away from the register and left him standing there with an outraged look on his face and servers and customers weaved about him in complete disregard for his presence TLDR A manager tells the customer the truth ,Thats offensive,735
SpyPies,22,158,1nvv0c,613,For context I work at a chain cardsstationarygift store This occurred last winter The winter holiday season is our busiest time of the year But when the holidays were over the stress and the stampeding crowds were not through with us yet for it was time for the afterholiday saleTwas a day or so after christmas and the store was bedecked bedazzled and befuddled with the afterholiday sales Dust was shaken off old boxes of inventory and were dragged up from the basement and excitable sale signs were generously distributed in abundance Everything from halloween knickknacks to easter toys were put on display in hopes of starting the new year with a fresher inventory The deals oh my the deals to be had  Enter a middle aged couple nice looking folk Just two of a few dozen or so shoppers pursuing our crazy missmosh of random this and thats They come up to the easter display and see were selling these big stuffed rabbits that were marked down to the gobstopping price of something in the range of  a piece Do you have more of these in the back They ask me We were only able to cram  or so of those suckers on the table without reducing the whole display into a pile of fluffy goodnessWe sure do I reply How many more would you likeIf its possible could you bring us all you haveThey ended up purchasing about  or  giant bags of stuffed animals Keep in mind we had no shopping bags big enough to accommodate their purchase we resorted to using these giant clear recycling bags not those funkysmelly black fellas rest assured They looked like they cleaned out a carnival Curious I asked them What are you guys going to do with all those toys Oh we were going to name redacted hospital after this Every year we try to give as many toys as we can afford to the childrens wardI never experienced such a warm feeling in my time working retail as I felt watching that nice couple attempt to squeeze their way out the door with their booty,All Stuffed Out An After Christmas Sale,771
Thinkalil,86,117,1hvf93,617,NOTE I am black I work at this fairly well known amusement park a couple miles from my hometown Im a ride operator so part of my job is to put the wristbands on the kids after weve checked their height This normally takes the hassle out of getting your childs height checked at every ride that they go to Its a great idea for those who dont want to wait in line for two hours and find out their kid is too short to ride One of the rides I work at requires you to be  inches to ride  no less So this white woman and her two small girls come walking up to my stand to get wristbands The two girls both have HIGH HEELS on because they know that they are not going to be tall enough for the rides they want to get on so theyre trying to cheat the system I measure one of the girls with her heels on because she fell into the  inch range with or without the heels on The other girl was about  inches without her heels on but was  with them on So I tell her to take her shoes off so that I cant measure her without them Me Alright darling do you mind taking your shoes off so that I can measure youThe mother looks at her daughter and then looks at me The daughter looks like shes about to cry because she knows that shes not going to be tall enough without them Mother Yeah I think youre being really racist right nowI am shocked because I have never been called racist before and Im thinking what kind of sheltered life do you live that anything a black person does to you that doesnt seem fair is racist She says she wants to speak to my manager and I say I can call him for you and she just storms off to talk to the manager from the places that takes photos of people in the park He literally has nothing to do with this situation but tells me to give her the  inch wrist band anyway He kept looking at me the entire time like I was the one in the wrong and agreeing with all her BS about how I was being racist I think he may have been trying to get her to leave but even so  I still dont see how I did anything wrong These wristbands are for your kids safety Not because we want to be mean My ride has a strict  inch requirement because the harness around you has to be able to lock around your body It does not have a floor to it so it makes the requirement necessary I just cant believe the people that get upset over this kind of thing ,Because if I WAS racist then youd have a problem,734

Bravesfan,266,293,1o2o5m,608,Hey everybody Another story coming from my view as a customer while eating in a restaurant This happened over the weekend so I thought that Id share with everybody and hopefully give you all a smile EnjoyBackground Im a  year old male who hadnt shaved in a little while so I looked near  or  while my date who I was out with is  but she looked to be about  or  with her makeup and her hair up the way she had itWe walk into an Italian restaurant thats known for its unlimited breadsticks and salads God I love this place Anyways we walk in I give them my name for the reservation and were taken back to our tableOur waiter takes our drink order and goes off while we talk and are having a great time Were sitting across from each other laughing like morons at the stories that we have to tell each other and just in general having a great time Our drinks are brought out and we order our food again no problems whatsoever Our waiter is extremely nice and courteous and even had a story to tell us even on a busy night like Saturday wasWere about halfway through our meal when an older lady walks up and this is how our conversation wentOld Lady OL Awww I think its adorable that you take your younger sister out to dinner Arent you just the sweetestMe Actually this is Lindsay name retracted my dateOL Your date How old are youMe Im OL That is absolutely DESPICABLEMe What do you mean Im only  and shes OL You think that you can take out a girl this young and get away with it Do you know what we call people like you Youre a PEDOPHILE You pedophile Do you get off on going out to eat with girls  years younger than youAt this time everybody in our section is just looking at us Lindsay is bright red and on the verge of tearsMe Listen Im on a date and while I dont mean to sound rude and its probably going to come out like that Leave us the fuck alone Were on a dateThe old lady walks out with her little canegang and our waiter comes over and apologizes for the incidentMe Its not a problem But in case youre wondering Im only  and shes  Im not a pedophileWaiter I didnt think you were Again Im sorry about that and if you need anything at all let me knowHe walks out and I keep getting death stares from other patrons as we continue our meal Our conversations were a bit more subdued no more laughing like two  year olds hopped up on sugar and sodaWe order some dessert and I look up and two cops are walking my way with this old lady at their heelsMe Son of a bitchCop Sir we received a complaint that youre out to eat with a girl substantially younger than you are and we just want to make sure that nobody is going to get hurtMe You have got to be fucking kidding me Right Let me guess That older lady over there told you that Im what   Something along those lines at that my date is what  or  Im  freaking years old and shes  Now please let us continue our date without anymore interruptionsCop Son if you cant be compliant then Im gonna have to take you downtown to question youMe Do you have any reason to detain me Have I done anything wrong whatsoever Im sitting here eating my food with my date and yall barge in like you own the place Waiter Can I get a check and some to go boxes please I really dont feel like dealing with them tonightCop Sir Im gonna need you to calm down Or youre going to go downtownMe All youve done since you got here is threaten to take me in without asking for any evidence at all Let alone asking me for an ID to figure this out quietly and discreetly you come in and make a big scene Im a loud guy I dont get bothered by having everybodys eyes on me or being the center of attention See my date See how shes hiding her head Yeah shes the quiet shy girl She doesnt like attentionCop Let me see your IDMe FineI start to reach for my wallethttpcacheindulgynethtfossilbhtkjpg which is kept in my front pocket and as Im reaching for it no quick or jerky movements mind you he pulls his taser on me and tells me to stop what Im doingMe What the fuck You asked for my wallet Im getting it for youThe cop reaches over and reaches into my pocket and grabs my wallet out for meCop Maam can I see your ID pleaseLindsay reaches into her purse and grabs her wallet and shows the cop her IDCop Well Would you look at that He was telling the truth I guess we can goOL What Youre going to let a pedophile go This is an outrageMe Ummm Officer Can I get your name and badge number You pulled your taser on me while I was trying to comply with what you didCop What are you gonna use it forMe To complain to your superior officer This was completely out of line I did nothing to warrant this whatsoever Your name and your badge numberI copied down his name and badge number we got out togo boxes I tried to pay the ticket but the waiter said that the manager had comped the ticket because of the trouble that we went throughI left that waiter a  tip and we went on our way We went out to go play minigolf and once we got to the course she started to not be so quiet and reserved and she opened up againHowever I got a text on Monday saying Bravesfan I like you I really do I just dont want to go through what we went through on Saturday night again Maybe if I start to look a little older than we can try again I really am sorrySo Im not sure whether she was using that as an out to get out of us talking and possibly pursuing a relationship or whether that is a true reason as to why she doesnt want us to go out again and we might try later I can definitely say that she looked quite sad on Monday in class and she still looked quite downtrodden today in classI really dont know what to say to her but I hope that you all enjoy the storyEDIT I seem to be getting a lot of two different replies to this thread so Ill answer them here to avoid having to answer them all seperately The way that the confrontation went down with the police is NOT why we did not go on a nd date I texted her and asked and she told me that she still likes me and that while I may not have handled that situation the best again it is NOT why were not going out on a nd date If you believe that my stories are not true or genuine then you dont need to comment I have no way of proving to all of you here at TFR that my stories are true If you dont believe they are you can leave me a downvote and move on I gain no comment by posting here I just like to tell my stories to everybody here at TFR,You Pedophile,901

JacOfAllTrades,98,141,17siae,604,My store has two notorious shopliftthenreturners and today one wandered in with her husband and fiveyearold child Ive watched this woman shove a duvet into her babys backpack she has no shame Because everyone working was involved well say Larry and Moe were the cashiers Curly was the manager Abbott who is that cliché effeminate gay guy and I were working on displays and Costello was stock On to the storyThe second Sticky Hands walked into the store she shouted at Abbott and I Ay One uh you gonna help me or what I recognized her immediately I walked over to her as she destroyed a bed display She asked how much a duvet was then the quilt then the sheets every sham and threw each item into a pile in the middle of the bed as she inquired about it After the bed was completely stripped she asked where the sale bedding was and I told her the back of the store I was waiting until she was out of ear shot to warn the guys in the back but Larry recognized her also and was quicker on the walkie talkieLarry Hey Moe and Curly theres a woman in a blue jumpsuit with a hat on and her belly hanging all out yes really walking back toward you guys She has her husband and kid with her but you watch her like a hawk Shes a thiefLarry was actually supposed to be off the clock at that time so she clocked out then went to the back of the store to watch Sticky Hands At first Moe and Curly just did the normal overlyhelpful thing one does with shoplifters but after about thirty minutes Curly was getting annoyed Moe had been doing a good job of not getting distracted She was using the walkie to call for everything from stock to price checks and never took her eyes off the woman Curly came over the walkies and said This is ridiculous She obviously isnt buying anything and shes wasting all of our timeOh Curly you just dont understand yetMe Curly its not what shes going to buy its what shes not going to pay for then return Shes done at least  worth of fraudulent returns that I know of Do not leave that section In fact if everyone can be in that section all the betterApparently Larry told him the same thingAbbott and Curly then decided the only displays that needed to be worked on were those in bedding and Costello went over to help Moe more quickly Basically if anyone has seen a shoplifter you will know exactly what Im talking about Sticky was asking bullshit questions about the bedding and saying things like Go check in the back for this Go in the back and check the price etc etc Once all four were in the back anything she asked they all answered with different answersSticky Does this come in a queenMoe FullQueenCostello NoAbbott Im a queen Also yes reallyCurly Theyre right behind youEvery now and then Moe would call over the headset Hey JacOfAllTrades can you price check item I told her  no matter what she asked She made up random numbersThis went on for about thirty minutes before Sticky finally admitted defeat and bought a sale duvet This should be the end of the story but its notSticky and the rest of the Hands family went out the back door and as they were walking back toward the front door in the mall hallway I could hear her telling him off for not distracting us enough He was useless and they couldnt get anything because he was so worthless She then walked in the front door and directly up to my counter She wanted to do a return  FineAs Im returning her item I took the bag and threw it in the trash and she immediately yells at me No I want to keep the bagMe Sorry maam I cant allow you to have a bag if you dont have paid merchandiseSticky Thats racistMe No maam it would be racist for me to let you do it and nobody elseSticky Thats bullshit What if I need that bagMe For whatSticky Other storesMe Im pretty sure other stores also have bagsSticky This is the dumbest bullshit Ive ever heard Give me that bag back now Youre telling me the most bullshitMe More bullshit than returning something less than five minutes after buying itSticky What the hell are you trying to sayMe You know exactly what Im sayingSticky This is bullshit You racist Im never coming backI finished processing her return as she thought of a hundred and one ways to tell me she was never coming back because clearly a lack of retort meant I couldnt hear her By the time I handed her the return receipt everyone but Moe had migrated to the front of the store and was watching this Curly whispered over the walkie Say anything you want to her well all back you up Oh god Dont give me that kind of permissionSticky put the receipt in her pocket and once again yelled at me Im never coming backMe Okay well then I have to ask what do you do with the merch cardsSticky WhatMe I would think there would be an end point unless you could get cash for them But if you get cash for them I would think you could buy clothes that fitSticky Whats that supposed to meanAbbott singing You need to cover your belly Its disgustingSticky I want a managerCurly Im right here big smileSticky was not amused Her parting words made us all giggle Yall will be hearin from my luhyer,We apologize profusely for not being more

there were about  sales people and a manager all hired under a contractor meaning we were not directly hired by Big Telecomm The story deals with the manager who I will address to as Bill Bill was a man that was full of tall tales had a real bad temper and had horrible work ethics The only part of his job that I remember was setting the schedule arriving late and leaving early on most of his shifts taking conference calls in which hed be so angry about our numbers that hed slam his fist on the desk or throw his pens around and announcing that there were customers in the store Im serious he went from Customer customer to Consumer consumer to Guest guest whenever someone was in the storeFucking sad reallyOne of the things about my job that I hated was dealing with money We never dealt with money unless a client wanted to buy a modem or router from us and usually that would be on card not cash In the extremely rare event that we took cash Id just fill out a form put the cash in an envelope and hand it to the armored truck guyHeres where things went downhill Bill got hired as an employee of Big Telecomm meaning that he was a manager of the store but not in charge of us This is good and bad At one point the powers that be decided that they will be running a promotion in which theyll be handing out free remotes for any customers that received an invitation This could be a very simple transaction Customer has a free remote voucher they get a free remote and go homeBill somehow made a rule that every remote that was sent out should cost a penny because by law we shouldnt be giving stuff out for free So the sales people were literally charging a penny for a free remote and if the customer didnt have it No problem We could throw in our ownThis became a problem because we started to pile up on pennies and giving the armored guy that took the deposits a shitload of pennies in an envelope just didnt cut it So Bill decided that we should just leave the pennies in the deposit box that was sitting next to our desks no big deal just a bunch of pennies in a box and no one would noticeAfter a year and a half and a bunch of accumulated PTO I was told that I need to take time off or I would lose all the PTO so I took a week off I was enjoying my time off at home when one of my coworkers who was also one of my best friends called me and told me Bill is trying to get you firedI asked her why and she told me that the district manager of our store stopped by to do a random inspection and saw that there were a shitload of pennies on the safe that were not deposited Even though I handled the deposits to the armored man Bills responsibility was to make sure that all deposits were sent in and he was the one that told me that the pennies should not be deposited and just left in the safe considering how many there wereI was not there to defend myself so Bill threw the whole pennies idea on me along with the fact that they were not deposited Along with that I had been given the task of handling set top box returns and our closet was full to the brim because we were not getting enough boxes in to send them out and Bills job was to order those boxes which he virtually never didWhen I return back to work everything was going fine I was setting up the quota for the month checking for work order errors just doing my thing The managers for the contractors Mike comes in and makes small talk with me and out of nowhere he throws So DeathByCarousel I really need another rep at our kiosk in this location I really think you should take the positionNow mind you Im the ops guy I do sales every now and then but only when its so busy that the sales people need help So I tell Mike to go out and have a smoke with me and talk about thisWe go out light up and he tells me that Bill is trying to get me fired that he spoke to his bosses about getting me fired but since I was a contractor he couldnt fire me directly Technically Mike was there to fire me but he told me that Bill was using me as a scapegoat for his incompetence and he was giving me the only two choices I had which was to transfer to another place and work as a salesman Or be firedAgain I had no choice I thanked Mike for his kindness and told him Id rather keep a job than not have a job at all so Id transfer within a couple days Mind you I didnt tell anyone that I was transferring except for that coworker that I considered one of my best friendsBill comes up right next to me and asks Are the rumors true That youre transferring I was so pissed off because I didnt say anything to anyone and apparently rumors were flying out already I confirmed his rumors and he said he would miss me along with everyone else that they would all miss meSo I leaveNow for the good partNot two weeks after I am doing my thing at the new place selling like a madman and killing my quota Mike stops by and asks me to come out for a smokeHe tells me that there are four or five employees along with himself that are trying to get Bill out of the other store He asks me if I would be willing to have an interview with the Big Red higher ups about Bills incompetenceOf course I agreeThe day comes and Im sitting in front of Bills bosses I tell them about Bills anger issues when it comes to conference calls or when the numbers are just a little too low I tell them about how Bill made a comment about how he got a gun and he could easily kill everyone in our team without emptying the chamber I tell them about how when one of the sales reps fell asleep on the back after closing time Bill was proud enough to bring said gun into the store because he was concerned to what he would do I told them about Bills early leave and late arrival use of profanity with all the reps inappropriate comments and how I was used as the scapegoat for the clusterfuck with the safe and the returns So many things that I dont even remember it allThey thanked me for my time apologized for the inconvenience and sent me my wayTwo days later I heard that Bill came walking into the store late as usual yelling on his phone and as soon as he walked in he was pulled into the office to resign his badge and that he was done and not to come back since he was banned from the storeServes you right BillThanks for readingEdit Edited some typosLittle epilogueI had quit working at the new store about a year and a half after joining in due to lack of foot traffic which meant decreased sales to the point in which we were on the red Instead of getting reprimanded I gave my two weeks and went to work at a call center for a competitorI get hired go through orientation and they introduce us to the teamHello team this is DeathByCarousel whos joining us from Big Telecomm Hey DeathByCarousel youre the second person that we have from Big Telecomm Do you happen to know a man named BillMy heart frozeBill worked there now I dont know if he was aware that I was a big part of the reason why he got let go Thankfully Bill was on vacation when I arrived and thankfully he never came back I did check the employee directory just to check that it was that Bill and there he was,You want to get me fired How about I get you fired instead,719

StinkyMcPoopiePants,72,150,1lrftn,596,Ok so I spent  years in retail mainly in the back of house at a large housewares store I didnt interact with customers much on the sales floor though I was the stockroom manager so I did have a little authorityI was closing one night and while I was at dinner my floor manager told me about this jerk that had just parked his big van in our customer pickup area and even worse he parked so that it took up both spots and the rest of the mall parking lot was always a zoo so we had to fight to protect these two spots She had been letting another employee out the back door when this guy pulled in and she asked if he was picking something up He said he wasnt he was doing some shopping and she told him the parking spots were for customers picking up only He then told her it wasnt his problem and walked awayWhen I got off my break I took a look and he was still parked there and must have stayed there for at least an hour Any time another customer would come to pick something up they had to park out in the middle of the parking lane and block traffic so it was a hassle I thought about calling security but it wasnt a really busy night so I just kept a watch for the guy but didnt worry muchIn the meantime a security guard came over and wrote him up We didnt call him as it turns out he was flirting with one of the girls that worked at my store so he was always looking for an excuse to hang around in this case it was just dumb luck that he noticed the guys van and wrote him up Our mall security really didnt have any authority so it wasnt really a ticket more of a dont park like a douchebag ticketWell pretty soon this guy comes back to his van after having parked there for probably   hours sees the ticket crumples it up and throws it on the ground Instead of getting in his car he walks towards our store entrance cursing under his breath I saw all this from the loading dock nearby where I was throwing the trash out I quickly ran inside because I knew what was comingYep as I got onto the sales floor this guy was laying into the night manager telling her that he was pissed that she called security that he wasnt paying any bullshit ticket and that he was never shopping there again His wife meanwhile looked like she wanted to crawl away and hide The thing about guys like this is that they do this all the time They push the rules or outright ignore them then get mad when somebody calls them on it By this time there were about  other employees around as well as a couple of customers The night manager was a sweet lady that didnt like confrontation so she was trying to be nice telling him that she didnt call security on him He kept saying This is bullshit and thats when I stepped inSir you need to stop She did not call security and I know that for a fact nobody here did And even if she had she had already warned you that you couldnt park there and you did anywayWho are you he said You dont know anything about this so stay out of it Im the manager and I do know because she told me all about you parking there I know that she warned you not to park there and I know that the security guards roam around and keep a close eye on our back door pickup spot I also know that its not ok for you to come in here and curse at employees and abuse them so you need to leave right now or Ill call the policeHe got so mad at that he turned brighter red than he already was and then he tried pulling out his trump card Whats your managers name Im going to call them tomorrow I told him her name and that she was love to hear from him I told him I would talk to her tonight and let her know to expect his call He quickly turned around and stormed out with his wife trailing meekly behind himI went back into the stockroom and was instantly surrounded by  employees all cheering at me telling me how awesome that was This wasnt like me at all however Like the title said in over  years this was the only time I kicked someone out of the store but it felt good So good Sorry for the lengthTldr  kicked a guy out for being an asshole,The only time I kicked a customer out of the store in over  years and it felt great,746

cassiethesassy,91,114,18ocag,588,This story isnt about a typical pain in the ass customer but on the other spectrum of thingsI worked at a very popular plus sized womens clothing store for a few years as a supervisor  It was a great job I had great coworkers and usually great customers but as the territory comes with specialty retail you definitely rack up on storiesI was opening one morning with an associate it was a quiet day early in the week so foot traffic was fairly slow  I got a phone call a few minutes after we opened and it was a man on the other lineMe STORENAME this is Cassiethesassy how can I help youMan on Phone Oh hi yes um I have a questionMe  Sure what can I do for youMOP Um well I was wondering if I could come in and purchase a um dress for myself  I was wondering if um I could try them onOur store had no set policy on letting men shop in the store for themselves but we always welcomed any customer because hey their money is just as green as anyone elsesMe Of course my best advice is to come by this morning or tomorrow morning while we dont have many customers in the store  If there IS another woman using the fitting rooms we will have to ask you to wait until shes finished but otherwise its not a problemWe had a back room where our fitting rooms were with  smaller ones and a larger handicapped room towards the end of the hallI told him my name and that to ask for me if hed like to come into the store and shop  He thanked me and our conversation was overI didnt think anything of it as we get phone calls from men who cross dress but very few acutally come IN to the store to try things on  They usually ordered online or bought some items and returned the ones that didnt work  Because we were a plus sized store our clothes were obviously bigger and longer which would fit more men than having them shop in a clothing store that had smaller sizes  I continued to organize various things as we were very slow in the morningsAbout  minutes later an older gentleman with bright white hair in a large windbreaker and khakis comes strolling in  I greet him as I usually would any customer and he quietly aproached meMOP Are you CassiethesassyMe Yes I am  Did you call earlierMOP  Yes I did I was hoping youd help me pick out a dress  I like to wear them around the houseMe  Not a problem was there something certain you had in mindWe continued to talk about what he was looking for  He was on a budget and our full priced merchandise was a bit more pricey than a discount retailer averaging about  for a new dress  So I escorted him to our clearance section and decided he would fit best in a X size  He picked out a few that he liked and asked if he could try them on  I obliged as we had no other customers in the store  I unlocked the farthest fitting room just in case we did get another customer and as I let him in with the items he said Will you stick around and give me your opinionMe Sure just let me know when youre readyI let him get settled and when I heard my name I knew he had the first dress on  He had picked some rather LOUD patterns as many plus sized clothing makers insist on making but as he tried them on I gave him my honest opinion  Between dresses he would drop down to his undergarments in front of me  When I say undergarments I mean he had a red stuffed bra on and matching red panties  Everything was covered but needless to say I learned a pretty good poker face that dayHe tried on about  different dresses and decided on a green satiny number with a black swirly pattern across it  As he was changing back into his clothes he looks at me hands me a  bill and says Wow I wish I had a girlfriend as nice as youNeedless to say it was a very sweet compliment but a bit out of the usual for myselfHe paid for the dress thanked me again and went about his way  Amazing what a little understanding and kindness can do for someones day plus hey  TLDR Cross dressing man tipped me  for helping him try on dresses during my shift at a womans plus sized clothing storeEdit WOW  Thank you everyone for your kind kind words  Your responses have been nothing short of amazing and really brightened my day  Remember to be KIND to each other whether youre in retail or not,I wish I had a girlfriend as nice as you how I earned a  tip in retail,702

yessircapntightpants,69,103,1qk546,589,I used to work for a video store which is this thing that used to exist that was kinda like Netflix except a Netflix you could walk inside  I was a Shift Leader one step below assistant manager and was working with my coworker whom well call Dave on a very busy Friday night  Dave was the sweetest most mildmannered person I ever met  Chipper and mellow and genuinely happy to be doing his menial thankless job  Friday nights at the video store were always a chaotic mess from about pm to pm  Huge lines of people wanting movies for their weekend viewing pleasure and a very limited number of cash registers and employees to ring them up The store I worked at had a fantastic Store Manager and as a result incredibly low turnover Everyone there knew what they were doing and we moved the crowds out fast provided no customer insisted on being difficult and taking up a register for ten minutes while they tried to figure out what phone number or name they put their account under or something like that So one particularly crazy Friday Dave and I are working the registers up front doing our usual hustle to get through the hordes of movierenters when in walks The Horrible Bitch THB from here on out  She had the sort of tan that one can only achieve by laying around and barking orders at the pool boy all day every day  Her bleach blonde hair was teased to nearJersey Shore levels and her acidwash skinny capris screamed I regret becoming an adult and am actively attempting to revert to my teenage years despite clearly pushing   The dead yet somehow angry look in her eyes was both haunting and repulsive  She had three boys with her ranging in age from roughly four to nineyearsold and she gave the impression that motherhood was the worst decision she ever madeShe didnt bother us while picking out movies and while she was curt and generally shitty to Dave while he rang her up she wasnt an exceptionally bad customer Dave was his usual sweet self and managed to get her rentals in order while she alternated between rolling her eyes at him making heavy sighing noises before answering questions and screaming at her kids to PUTTHATCANDYBACKRIGHTNOW  If you work retail you know that these sorts of customers barely phase you  Sure theyre unpleasant but if theyre not actively yelling at you and causing a scene you just kinda assume they had a bad day and try not to make it any worse  Dave handed her the movies she rented and wished her a pleasant evening as she left and then went back to ring up the next customer in the incredibly huge line Less than thirty seconds later THB angrily storms back in clearly looking for something  Dave sees her and asks if she forgot something and she snaps that she left her keys on the counter  Dave checks the counter and also the space behind his register and around the cashwrap but doesnt see any keys While still ringing up other customers he asks me and the other people working that night if any of us have seen a set of keys  No one has  A couple of helpful generally nice people waiting in line even hear this and do us a solid by looking around the front area since we cant really come around when theres a huge line of customers  No one sees any keys Dave is trying to helpful but he has other less horrible customers who need his attention so THB winds up storming around the cashwrap area searching for her keys amongst the display cases that line the registers This wouldnt be a problem except that shes searching by pulling all the product down from its neatly organized POP space and just leaving it in piles on the floor or the counter Were busy and shes clearly ready to explode so we dont even try to stop her  We both know itll be easier to just clean up her mess than it would be to try and reason with her  After tearing our cashwrap displays apart she starts loudly accusing us of hiding her keys out of spite  Maybe shes seen Clerks and maybe shes fully aware that shes an unpleasant bitch to the Plebians that ring up her purchases but shes become absolutely certain that we threw her keys in the trash She demands that we dig through the trash RIGHTTHISSECOND and give her back her keys We explain that we havent seen her keys and we certainly didnt throw them away Dave even takes a moment away from his register to show her the small trash bin we keep up front which is almost empty and clearly doesnt contain any keys THB is not satisfied  She wants us to check the big outdoor trash can by the door  Despite the fact that her truck is parked right in front of the store and that no one could have thrown her keys away in that can without her seeing them she is insistent that we drop everything and go pick through the garbage Honestly if it were a slow time and there werent any other customers waiting one of us probably would have thrown on some gloves and just done it Years of retail make you highly likely to do something you know is stupid because its always easier than trying to convince a customer that their request is in fact stupid  Its Friday night though and theres no way were closing a register to placate her obvious personality disorder She storms out again and Dave looks out the window a minute later and informs me that she has dumped out our outside garbage right in the middle of the sidewalk and is forcing her children to dig through it  Nothing like adding a little childlabor to your harassment of innocent retail clerks to really take things up a notch  He mentions that shes probably going to leave that mess there and hes not wrong  THB gets a cab or a ride home from someone so the next time we look outside shes gone leaving only a pile of video store garbage and her shiny new truck in her wake Later that night after close were doing our standard restocking and straightening of the concessions out front when Dave yells for me  I look up and hes pulling a set of keys out one of the candy bins  The same candy bin that THBs child had been digging through before she started screaming at him like a volatile harpee Now I dont know if said child just happened to drop the keys and forget or if it was purposeful revenge for the screaming or if he realized that hed dropped them but was too terrified of his psychotic mother to speak up but either way her keys had been there the whole time  Without a word Dave took the keys and walked out to the parking lot where THBs shiny new red truck was still stranded  Because Dave was such a nice guy I assumed he was going to toss them in the back and maybe throw a note on the windshield or something  Instead I watched him hold the keys in his hand and slowly gouge a scratch from the back of the tailgate to the front headlight and then throw those keys in the same trashcan that THB has upended during her rage  He walked back in saw me staring and said Bitch made me pick up garbage Fuck her and her keys And with that he quietly resumed his closing dutiestldr You forgot your keys,The woman who pushed my mild mannered coworker to commit vandalism,692

namepoc,43,117,1mymox,584,I remember this incident from about two years ago it amazes me to this day how some people act I was working the till in my shop it wasnt too busy about three or four customers and just after lunch time An oldish lady walks in and comes up to the desk Hats I need a hat I thought it was quite rude how she asked but I still pointed them out to her She then decides to wander over to the DVDs not sure why but knocks a woman over getting through the small gap by the rail of clothes She then pushes another woman to the right to see the DVDs without politely asking her to move I noticed the customers were getting aggravated especially when she knocked a childs dress off the rail and says to the customer Pick that up I was shocked and went over and asked her if there was something I could help her withShe says to me I need a mirror to see the hat where is your mirror I said to her that our mirror was in the changing room but shell have to wait as there is someone in there trying something on I walked back to the counter to serve a customer who seemed eager to buy and get out I apologised to the customer when suddenly I hear a gasp I look up and the elderly woman had pulled open the fitting room curtain to reveal a customer who was practically naked and was saying to her I need to see the mirror I went over to quickly close the curtain Took the hat off the woman and banned her from the shop The customer getting changed was very shocked about what had happened I felt so bad as I am sure some of the other customers had seen her nearly nude I let her have discount off the clothes she wanted ,Thinks she is royalty,701

AnastasiaBrianne,36,141,1op4rp,580,Okay I work at a store that is everywhere and sells everything I work as a sales associate in dry groceryWell I got to work and clocked on I go find a manager like I do everyday This manager is a guy who is all by the book and no joking around Just workHe is telling me to stock this change the display of that yada yada yada He then LITERALLY started puting his hand in his mouth Like trying to fit the whole thing in It was quite abrupt and strangeHe fits a good chunk in his mouth as he is still talking And takes it out and tells me he wanted to see if he could talk with his hand in his mouth Then he just leaves me to do my work without anymore explaination,Lets see if you can put your foot in your mouth next,721
Inceptagon,113,111,1eb5ex,577,This is my first post so just let me know if Im doing anything wrongI work as a kitchen grunt at a fast food place My favorite station is drivethru because we are a bit of an upperclass place and our menu items border on ridiculously complicated so I enjoy just sitting back to take orders and letting everyone else do the work of making the stuff Still there is the occasional customer who makes me want to tear my hair outLate one night I get a guy who talks on the speaker in a low passiveaggressive tone as though hes being forced to order food against his will He orders about seventy dollars worth of food and says that he wants his food in separate bags which is fine We get that a lot So I listen as he lists what goes in the first bag then the second bag Then he makes some modifications to the first bag Then he asks to change something in the second bag Then he asks to remove some items from the first bag and put them in the second bag This starts to get on my nerves but I seem to be following along just fine and I go with it Finally when hes all done he says So whats the total on the first orderOh snap It dawns on me that he wanted separate orders not just bags And I learn he didnt just want two but three separate checks And thats a bit terrifying because our pointofsale software is very badly designed and its a nightmare to split arbitrary items onto a separate check So I tell him to pull around to the window there were no other cars in the lane at the time and Id tell him his total there When he gets to the window he looks seriously pissed but I try to ignore it and I calmly tell him Im sorry sir but I didnt quite catch that you wanted your check split into different orders I thought you just wanted separate bags So Im going to go through everything one more time just to make sure I have them on the correct checksAnd I do I meticulously list every single item he ordered one at a time and wait until he gives a mmhmm or a yes or some sort of confirmation before continuing It takes about fifteen minutes no joke But I walk him through each check and I give him his total for a check and swipe his card before moving onto the next This is my typical problem resolution strategy when Im not entirely sure what the customer orderedBut to my horror as soon as I give him his third and final credit card receipt he stares at it for a moment and he gives me an odd look I ask Is something the matter and he says Wait this is all wrong These are all on the wrong checksIts at this point that I nearly explode thinking I just spent fifteen freaking minutes doublechecking every single item him and he waits until AFTER I run all three of his cards through to realize everythings wrong DID HE THINK I WAS TALKING TO MYSELFWhen I went to get the manager to conduct the postadjust I explained more like ranted about the situation and I asked her to finish the transaction for me because I couldnt hold my composure in front of the guy anymoreWhenever I train someone on drivethru I warn them that the hardest part isnt learning our menu or learning our glitchy and aptlynamed POS software interface Thats only the beginning The real challenge is dealing with customers who have communication issues,Wait this is all wrong,688
wyrmcrypt,34,141,1i30i3,581,Long time lurker first postSome background  I worked at a local convenience store for the better part of  years  My store in particular being a small neighborhood store closed at  AM  This store also had a full service deli with a steam table that we would serve soup hot sandwich items and hot sides from  At  PM we would disassemble the steam table for cleaning  The below customer which I will refer to as AC came in at AC    Yea can I get a meatball sandwichMe    I am sorry miss but we have already cleaned up the hot foods for the night  Can I get you a cold sandwich or something As an aside this already annoyed me because we had cleaned up everything and put it away AC    Nah how about some Mac and CheeseMe    As I said no hot foods  Sorry about thatAC    Do you have any chicken noodle soup leftMe     Nothing hotAC    How about hot roast beefMe    You just said hotTldr  Hot roast beef is now cold,You just said hot,722
kayser,283,103,19grei,578,So I work at food chain I know not exactly retail but I felt you all would understand my feelings here I was working the drive thru yesterday and we were swamped with people and low on staff I answer the drive thru and this man answers with lkjasdufoaskn I had no idea what he said so I said Im sorry sir could you repeat that Again I get garbled response I look to my coworkers who are also wearing headsets and hear his response Everyone was very confused I asked one more time as politely as possible And he screams his order which makes it much more difficult to hear but I believe he orders two sandwiches and a coffee When he gets up to the window I charge him for his order and pass out the order He immediately starts cussing at me His face is a violent shade of red and is just screaming about how I cant do my damn job right and how he only ordered one sandwich My manager is standing next to me and offers to take over The man then throws the extra sandwich at my manager and demands a refund Manager gives him his refund and then tells him he must leave and if he ever treats his staff like that again he will be banned from this store He screams a few more cusses at manager to which his response is And have a nice day and waves good byeThe car immediately behind him apologizes for what I have to put up with and tips me  How do people get to the point where they think that behavior is okay The killer part is once it goes out the window I am not allowed to take it back so if he would have just said I only ordered one sandwich he would have received two sandwiches for the price of one This was a situation that could have been easily fixed How does freaking out and getting mad help them out at all,How do people think this behavior is okay,681

ResultsVary,117,144,1nahw7,578,Hello friends from TFR I come with more glad tidings and hilarity from ltInsert Office Supply Company HeregtSo A little background My company like most does have a return policy up to  days Well return any item provided it hasnt been opened within the first  days After that tough titties Also if the product is open I AM going to search said product to make sure everything is in there that is supposed to be If a piece is missing Tough Titties If all parts are accounted for I will return it with a restocking fee of  Dont want the restocking fee Nothing I can do about itAnyways Now that little piece of policy is out of the way we can move on Fast forward to tonight Im the closing MOD Manager on Duty and I was in the cash office trying to fix one of our little palm pilot computers when I hear a knock at my door Its our only cashier at the moment He has a couple returning an office chair Not a big thingBut of course there is always a complication Not only is said chair an online order which were not supposed to return in the first place but it has been partially assembled Were talking literally half put together Half put together wrong I sigh not wanting to tell someone oops cant return it my bad and get them all pissed off I tell the cashier to tell them there will be a  restocking fee on the chair I get another knock at the door and its the cashier telling me they want to speak to me Here we goFor the sake of it Im going to call the woman CW and the guy CM Me Hey folks What seems to be wrong with the chairCW Nothing It just didnt fitMe Well As ltCashiergt stated We can return it but therell be a  restocking feeCW and CM EXPLAIN WHY literally in unison they practicedMe Well For one per our return policy I shouldnt even be returning online orders You have to go through the company for that For two since I am returning it and the chair isnt in its original packaging I have to charge a restocking feeCM Thats bullshit No one ever told us thatMe Sir our salesmen on the floor dont go over every piece of the return policyCW Well I dont see it placed anywhere How are we supposed to know what your return policy isMe taps the gigantic fucking mat with massive print RETURN POLICY in front of them This is placed at every register so that customers can see what the policy is on whatever item they are purchasing CM Come on Like Im supposed to remember all of that its not printed anywhere else for us to seeMe Turns their receipt over Its also printed here Several timesCM Well the salesmen should have told us We wouldnt have bought the chair The reason were returning it is because it took us  hours to assemble and it was too big You guys should build chairs for your customers for freeAt this point I keep my mouth shut I have personally built the chair in question in under  minutes Its actually one of the easiest chairs we have to buildMe I apologize for the time it took but I have to stand by my stores policy Im happy to return it with a  restocking fee CM YOU ARE VIOLATING MY RIGHTS AS AN AMERICANMe  wutCM YOU ARE BREAKING ltMidwest Stategt LAW BY CHARGING ME FOR RETURNINGMe Im pretty sure ltMidwest Stategt doesnt have a law stating that CW Honey Calm downCM NO IM GOING TO THE BACK TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THE RETURN POLICY STATED BY THE CHAIRS ALSO IM CALLING MY LAWYERMe Uh OkayCW Im Sorry But still Were not paying the restocking fee Do you guys really expect us to put everything back in the boxMe Were actually not supposed to return it at all if its an order Thats why theres no return code at the bottom of the receipt Im returning it as a kindnessCW Well Ive seen you guys sell chairs off your floor Do you charge an extra  Me  No If one of the chairs is discontinued and the display is our last one well sell it  off CW EXACTLY SO WHY CHARGE Me Because maam this is a business I will now have  displays of the same chair And Ill eventually have to sell the one you returned at  off CW UNGH I need to speak to your manager Me I am the manager maam CW No Your REAL manager Youre far too young and stupid to be running a place like thisMe Well Im the only manager here the other one will be in tomorrow morning and because youve insulted me now Im going to definitely going to charge you the restocking fee It keeps going This entire thing took like  minutes Stick with me TFR its almost doneCM comes back up red in the face and vein protruding from his neck and forehead CM OUR LAWYER IS AN IDIOT AND NOWHERE BACK THERE IS YOUR RETURN POLICY OUTLINEDMe Sir We cant post our return policy on every single item or place Thats why its on the back of the receipt as well as at the register As I told your wife just now you can come back tomorrow morning and talk to another manager if you are not happy with what Im telling youCM WE WILL AND ILL FIND THE LAW YOURE BREAKING YOURE GOING DOWNCW Well be back tomorrow And with that They grab their chair receipt and remains of their dignity and left ltCashiergt looked terrified I shrugged and went back to doing what I was doing I texted the manager who would be in the next morning and told him the story He vowed to stand up to my decision Honestly If youre going to buy an item why not know the return policy I mean I deal with at least  returns a day where the person doesnt understand that if a product is opened we have to charge a restocking fee in order to deter people who will rent itemsTLDR Apparently Im violating the constitution and my states laws by charging a restocking fee for a half constructed chair out of its packageUPDATE Boss just text me back Apparently the couple came back right at open As in they waited outside the doors for  minutes until we opened He told me that they gave him the same schpeel and how I was an idiot and breaking the law by charging them  My boss said he actually laughed told them that because they insulted me they lost all chance to bargain and that he wouldnt even return it with a restocking fee Because per store policy he didnt have toI love my bosses D,You are violating my rights as an American,722

DrunkenBlackBelt,87,154,16k2wk,573,Hello one and all Know its been a while Some shake ups at work have prevented me from accessing the internet but fuck it I have stories to share  So todays is one of my favorite tales of catching a liar in an act  This is the tale of Dig Dug Throughout the story please insert your own shoveling noises with each lie to accompany the image of this girl digging herself deeper  Or if you are a RvB fan just pretend she made shoveling noises with her mouth AnywaysSo its another day at GDNickels  My partner Stacy is on the cameras when she alerts me to a case  On her screen is a young latina woman pushing a baby stroller and accompanied by a younger girl who looks maybe  or so  Stacy had already seen then place some fashion jewelry on top of the hood of the baby basket and then cover them with some shirts they selected So while its concealment its one of those situations where it doesnt mean they are going to steal the items  We see people place items there all the time Sometimes as convenience and sometimes as a way to steal  Either way it warrants watching We knew we had a real case on our hands when they folded the hood up pretending to coo at the baby inside  Now all the items were concealed inside the stroller  The two girls walked around before finding a corner of the store where they quickly reach into the folded hood of the stroller and shoved the clothes into a baby bag They then proceeded to head to the exit of the store  Stacy and I met them at the exit did the regular LP steps and led them to the LP office to process them Now the older girl was already in trouble  But like most shoplifters she tried to lie her way out of it  What makes this story different is the amount of lies fed to us and the sheer stupidity of them  So we will call this girl Dig Dug or DD for shortSo we are in the office and Im searching the baby bag and stroller while DD and the younger girl are sitting on the bench  Stacy is questioning them DD says she has no ID but that her name is yolanda and she is  years old  The younger girl says she is   Inside the baby bag I find baby items our merchandise and several pairs or shirts and jeans from other stores all without a receipt  Now in the bag is one of those plastic containers containing baby wipes  I open it up and taped to the inside is DDs license  And sure enough her name is not Yolanda  So I turn to the younger girl and ask how she knows Miranda  The little girl replies that she is her aunt  Me Ok And what was her name againLG MirandaMe But she said it was YolandaDD Mirandas a nicknameM I see Then who is Insert Real Name from license hereDD Never heard of herM Well thats funny cuz there is a drivers license hidden in the baby wipes with your picture and that nameDD  Ive never seen that in my life You planted it thereMe and Stacy shared a glance and started to laughM So I planted a fully ready license with your picture and false info never having met or even seen you before  minutes ago when you were stealing our stuff  I also supposed you are really  and not  like this license says  Shoveling NoisesDD I bought those clothesM Im sure you bought all these other clothes in this bag from the other stores tooDD Yea we were returning them   Shoveling NoisesM Listen youre already in a lot of trouble for stealing with two children in your presence  Lying isnt gonna help  Is this your real nameDD  Yes M That wasnt so hard  Now is this girl really your nieceDD YesM Well we dont have any way of verifying that until the cops show upDD panicked yells WHY ARE THE COPS COMING while standing up quickly Stacy forces her to sit back down and tells her to stay seated unless she wants to get cuffed Stacy then explained that the cops are coming because she stole clothesDD But they just fell in there   Shoveling NoisesM We have you on cameraDD So then you can see they just fell in there   Shoveling NoisesM So you want us to believe despite what our eyes camera footage and common sense tells us that the clothes and jewelry somehow fell into your baby bag Despite the fact that they are in different parts of the store Despite the fact that the bag was closed and despite the fact that the bag was underneath your strollerDDM Listen we arent idiots  And even if we were those lies just are so bad that you arent doing anything but making an ass of yourselfDD DONT SWEAR IN FRONT OF MY BABY AND NIECEM DONT STEAL IN FRONT OF YOUR BABY AND NIECEAt this point the baby started crying so we allowed DD to take care of him and feed him while we waited and did our processingWhile we were waiting I decided to continue to ask her about the other clothesM These other clothes from these other stores did they fall in the bag tooDD No we bought them early   Shoveling NoisesM Well why are they in your baby bag and not in a store bag And wheres the receiptDD We spilt soda  OK FUCK THE SHOVELS WE ARE GONNA NEED A BACK HOE UP IN HERE Catepillar bitchesM Ummoooook  Spilt soda AndDD Yea so we had to throw the bag and receipt outM Because the soda ruined themDD Yes  I promiseM  Then why are the shirts neither wet nor stainedDD  We got them out in timeM  Why are you lyingDD I swear If I stole them Id have removed the store tags off of themM You didnt remove the tags off of our shirtsDD Well I didnt steal themM Listen heres the deal  When the cops come they are gonna ask you the same thing If you cant prove you bought these they are going to bring you in handcuffs to the stores and ask if they saw your purchase these If they didnt youll be charged there as well But if you tell me now we will just return them to the store and save you the extra chargesDD I stole themNow in truth most stores have a policy that once its out the door they cant do anything And smaller stores cant accuse you of stealing it if they cant remember you buying them The sheer amount of customers they get plus different cashiers makes it impossible  I just wanted to put her down a few pegsM Ok do you have anyone who can come get your niece and sonDDWhy its only like  worth of stuff theyll just release me  Ive been through this beforeM Im sure you have and yes its only  But youre also look at two felony countsDD FOR WHATM Child EndangermentDD BullshitM STOP SWEARING IN FRONT OF YOUR NIECE AND SONDD Glares at meM Listen Im not trying be an ass here Youre not just gonna walk away  You used two children to steal  Thats Child Endangerment  Thats a felony  Someone is gonna have to come get these kids  DD Nah youre lying Ill be fineM Im not lying Listen I know youve been a pain in the ass and weve been harsh back but we are tryna help you here  Would you rather someone grab them here or at the police station while youre locked upDD Stop playing  Ill be fineEventually me and Stacy gave up tryna convince her and we sat in silence until the cops arrived They did what they needed to do laughed at the tales of stupidity we had to share and asked DD if there was anyone she could call DD WhyCop To come get the kidsDD What WhyM I already tried to explainDD Explain whatCop Well someone needs to come get the kidsDD WHYCop Because youre going to jail for the weekendDD WHAT WHYCop SeriouslyThe cop explained the child endangerment charges and how it was Saturday so shed have to wait till Monday to be arraigned DD was not happy about it She was also shocked that I upstanding young man that I am wasnt lyingDD They dont have anyone else Im the only oneCop Well then how come the Little Girl has a different address then youDD  Tax Reasons  WELP NOW FUCK THE BACK HOE CAN WE GET THAT GIANT DRILL MACHINE THEY HAD IN ARMAGEDDON  MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATECop Tax ReasonsDD Yea it helps with Taxes But she doesnt live thereCop So youre telling me youre

CondescendingMartian,129,161,19az29,564,TLDR Sought a Crayola Crayon Maker and buried myself alive So given how the tale of the Shitscalator utterly disgusted people I felt that I should share one my stories on the other side of the spectrum Two Seasons ago I had traded out my couponshilling masters to work at a dreaded company involving a giraffe toys and toys occasional quantum status as people You might say that we were them even However despite the fearsome reputation the company has as a place to work for I was quite enjoying it My boss didnt mind if I fucked around in a Spiderman mask on occasion and the HR guy let me do toy demos once a month Any job where I get paid to play with remote controlled helicopters for four hours is a fantastic job in my bookAlso I was backofhouse now and didnt have to come within a mile of customer service which really did wonders for my disposition On this particular December morn however we had more backofhouse guys than we needed and as the least experienced member of our illustrious minimumwage association I was booted out to suffer on the sales floor Given that Yule loomed over the end of the week like Santa over a plate of confectioneries we were packed A fair matron rushed up to me reeking of cigarettes and bad life decisions Sir spake she I absolutely need a Crayola Crayon Maker or my daughters Christmas will be ruinedNow as an aside I absolutely hate being guilted about this shit My family is not exactly descended from Croesus understand and whenever people make me out to be their kids last hope to receive the  one gift that would makeup for being mentally traumatized by their parents I remember my mother taking out two jobs when I was a brat so my sister and I could have half the stuff we wanted I dont want to feel responsible for peoples holiday not playing out like a Disney movie God dammit dont put that on me I think Ill give Mom a hug when I get home tonightSo she wanted a Crayola Crayon Maker Needed one The world would end without one And so by my obligations as a knight and the fact that I was getting paid to do this sort of thing I told her that I would quest into the fabled Back for her I immediately rushed to the greatest of Sages the store inventory count to acquire the knowledge I needed to reach my prize It bent down under the weight of its knowledge and I was bathed in the illuminating electric glow We had exactly two in the store and both were on the sales floor Flying fucking shit dammit But how could I call myself a knight if I surrendered at the first sign of resistance My noble ancestors would be ashamed of me After freaking out about how they were alive in a world that they didnt understand sure but ashamed nonethelessThough worst come to worst I could probably distract them with indoor plumbing for a good monthI asked the font of knowledge where my prizes were last stored I received a few bays where they had been scanned out weeks ago Damn I ran and did a cursory check nonetheless but both the standard bays and the TZ single item bays were bereft of crayons and the makes thereof I returned to the matron with a heavy heart and informed her of the trials that loomed before me If she was willing to wait I told her I would search until I found them If they were still in the store they would be mine This I swore on my honor Then I remembered how I stole my sisters dessert the night before and swore on the holiday season itself Mentally of course since I dont actually talk like that out loudSurprise of all surprises she said that she would wait Usually when I say that I have no idea how long it would take me to find an item if it even remains in the store the customer departs in a huff But she remained determined to wait out my efforts and my previous coldness regarding her cause melted away I resolved to do my absolute best to find a Crayola Crayon Maker for herI journeyed to the faraway hills of the reshop carts My prize dwelt not among the people there I climbed the fabled cliffs of overstock bays but my quarry remained elusive It was then that I knew where I must go The mountains of shit that got unloaded from the truck last night While technically in the back they werent scanned into any bays My heart sank and for a moment I despaired But no I did not come this far to be defeated by a tower of cardboard boxes Seriously it probably broke a few safety regulations I would climb to its peaks or perish in the attemptReaching the loading dock I beheld my enemy Somewhere deep within the heart of the mountain lay a box of Crayola Crayon Makers sweeter than any gem ever unearthed by mortal men It had to be It had to beI spent twenty minutes crawling around and on top of the pile It was nowhere in sight I excavated several tunnels into the depths but I found it not My heart began to wrestle with the possibility of failure Suddenly something caught my eye In the very back of the pile just barely visible thanks to my digging efforts a box with the Crayola brand emblazoned upon it peeked out of the gloom I strained to see if it was followed the the word crayon which would hopefully bring the word maker along with it but I could not make anything else outHope was kindled I carefully crafted a tunnel through the heart of the mountain probably breaking even more safety regulations I gingerly crawled through an opening supported by some hot wheels and a box of Iron Man masks On my hands and knees I inched towards the box My fingertip could just barely brush it Then I managed to get an index finger around the corner I strained and strained and managed to get half of my palm on the box This gave me enough leverage to pull it towards meI felt like the event should have been accompanied by sunbursts and the choir invisible As it was I read the words Crayola Crayon Maker celebrated only by a cloud of dust and spider poop Still though never did I know a sweeter triumph I hollered a tribute to my conquest and raised my fist in victoryAs I did so I accidentally punched the roof of my tunnel and collapsed it onto myself I was trapped Entombed before my timeFortunately my compatriots had heard my yodel of triumph and came to investigate A few minutes later I was free of my premature grave though not without more than a bit of teasing and striding towards the matron with my head held highShe received her crayon maker I received a commendation and Christmas was saved for everyone forever ,The Quest for the Crayola Crayon Maker,725
IronyJudge,61,133,1q54dq,560,Back before I was the stores knowitall guy I was a lowly cashier I took pretty quickly to dealing with our archaic system and found out many of the systems rather unfortunate quirks The system will block you out if youre at a certain screen If you hit the wrong button at a particular time itll discard data and make angry noises One of the more unfortunate problems is how there is a screen of no return Once you reach it it is impossible to go back no matter how much you tryI was still pretty new so I was in the panicked Theyre going to fire me for doing something wrong state Any time a customer made a complaint Id shit myself in fear until one fateful night Ive previously stated my store occasionally serves people who inhabit the most notorious snob suburb in the metro areaOne rather nice old lady comes up with a few cans of one particular brand of dog food I start scanning the cans then the customer behind her in line starts screamingPR Lady decision for the initials to be revealed later THOSE ARE MINE  Me Sorry they were the same brand as hers I then remove the two cans I scanned from the first customers bill then close out the transaction She pleasantly thanked me and went on her merry way PR Lady was now at bat and she plopped a bag of dog food face down UPC up on the counter I scan her  cans of dog food then the bag of food ask her for her rewards card information announce the price total She swipes her credit card willingly then I hit the button that brings you to the screen of no return Its the screen to sign for the purchasePRL Did it give me my dollar off  Me Im not entirely sure but were past the point of no return Once you sign and the receipt prints out Ill see and if it didnt Id gladly fix it if it didnt  PRL Im not signing for it  Me The transaction can easily be fixed If you sign and there is a problem well simply cancel it out and do it again  PRL Just go back and tell me if the dollar came off  Me I cant do that You cant go back from this screen  PRL YES YOU CAN GO BACK AND TELL ME IF MY DOLLAR CAME OFF  Id been working there for a few months by that point mostly on register and she knew the system better than me apparentlyMe Once the receipt prints out Ill be able to tell you If you could just sign really quick and if its wrong well be able to fix it  PRL NO  Heres where I make the fatal mistake I reach over to the credit pad and hit the cancel button This has the effect of immediately timeouting the machine and popping out both the receipt and a little paper slip for the customer to signPRL YOU JUST SIGNED FOR ME WHAT THE HELL YOU LITTLE BRAT THIS IS FRAUD  Me  manager to register one Backup cashier  PRL I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR THIS YOU ARE GETTING FIRED TONIGHT YOU PUNK Manager then arrives In the few months Id worked shes proven herself to be among the most levelheaded in the store She also has the poker face of a championAGM What seems to be the problem  Me She was unsure if the sale price ran  PRL There was a coupon on the front of the bag he didnt ring it up I refused to sign for the purchase then he signed my name This is fraud This is legally fraudI had no knowledge of this coupon She put the bag face down on the register There was no way I could have seen itMe I hit the cancel button to make the mach  PRL YOU SIGNED FOR MEAGM Im sorry about that I will cancel out the transaction and I will personally ring it up and make sure the coupon gets inThe customer behind PRL pipes up and says to me You did nothing wrong This lady is just crazy That made me happy and PRL just kept on with any possible insult towards me she could AGM finally finishes the transaction with the coupon applied PRL signs then walks out the doorI go back to ringing the nice lady who called PRL crazy The customer behind her also gave words of consolation The other cashier now a manager told me that was one of the worst shes seenThen AGM comes up behind me gets on the PA and calls another cashier upAGM She wants you to apologizeI turn around and PRL is standing at the front of the store still fuming The other cashier gets there and I walk over to issue my formal apology PRL You high school punk I want you to apologize for committing fraudI will admit I look about  years younger than I am Its reasonable for her to think Im in high school by appearances but at that time I was cracking open LSAT study books I also decided to whip out my bigboy vocabularyMe I do most solemnly apologize for any transgressions If you could kindly enumerate every one of them so I may appropriately respond to my failureshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmmIyrloampnoredirect  PRL rants on for two minutes without realizing just how much my apology was dripping with sarcasm I tune her out I dont care Im going to let her yell and when she stops yelling for a few seconds Ill give her a canned responsePRL stops yelling  Me I understand your concerns My intent was not to defraud you but to make the machine print out a receipt to see if your dollar had been properly removed I fully apologize for the misunderstanding and wish to assure you it was in good faith  PRL YOU BETTER APOLOGIZE

again tuned out AGM finally steps in and tells her shell take care of it PRL smacks into the door and gets pissed until I open it for her Once I get back inside AGM motions me to go to the office At this point Im shaking freaking out that Im about to be fired We get into the office and she instructs me to sit down She sits casually on one of the tables and starts laughing her head offAGM What a goddamn bitch I didnt stop her because I was stunned at just how wretched of a human being she was Sorry but oh my god Ive never seen anything like that before  Me  so Im not in trouble  AGM Ill pay

MajikToastsLady,82,144,1j92st,563,Recently I have moved an hour away from home for uni I dont really know anybody here besides my boyfriend and our roommates Ive gotten to know a couple coworkers and Im still familiarizing myself with a the new store I work for a fast food chain and I transferred stores so things are a little different Today we had some very rude people come in to my store I guess they do this a lot however Anyways while sweeping up our lobby these two boys and a girl came in They ordered food from me no big deal I got their food quickly and there were no issues They walk away with their food all was wellA little back story My coworker tells me how the girl and her sister had tried to get her fired once for something completely unrelated to work Other than somebody brought up where my coworker works in a Facebook argument and we have a social media policy stating we cant post anything about our company Reason why I am not naming where I work And so this girl and her sister tried to use this against my coworker and it obviously didnt workSo a little time passes and my manager asks me to go check our lobby and clean up whatever needs done since were slow No problem Until I am wiping down a table that is one table away from theirs They proceed to have a conversation rather loudly that goes a little something like thisBoy one Man Im glad I dont have to work hereBoy two Me too then I might get fat like that girl over thereBoy one   looks over  Oh my God youre rightGirl  laughs  Guys thats not nice sarcastically of courseAre you fucking kidding me Why on earth would you say that to somebody They werent prizes either For clarification I am a size  Not small but not big Just average Everything about me is average Except Im a little shortSo I walk away to go get a broom to just sweep hoping that they either leave or something changes Well no when I had to sweep the area where they are sitting they make sure to have another loud conversation about meBoy one Oh and shes back againBoy two Just watch her bend over her rolls get twice as badGirl Im glad I dont have that muffin top Thats just ridiculous Obviously she needs clothes that fitBoy two Im glad youre not fat This is to his ridiculously thin girlfriendSo I promptly left to just clean the other side of the lobby and had told my coworker who had expressed her issues with them being there in the first place what just happened She told her manager and in doing so the front line team heard While I was getting a mop to finish the other side of our lobby my boyfriend we work together asks me whats wrong I shrugged it off told him it was nothing and finished that part of the lobby as soon as possible I empty the mop bucket and come back to the front line to take my position back over I see my manager throw this group out This is the first time I have ever worked with this manager But he gave me a thumbs up from across the lobby as they left About ten minutes later he fields a call from two different angry moms on why their children who were threatened first were thrown out of our establishment He proceeded to tell them that when they the group of teenagers initially ordered their food nobody said anything to them besides the obvious questions for their order And that when his employee me went to clean the lobby she didnt say a word to them He had been in the office at that time counting the safe down and could see me on the camera system One mom left it at that however the other mother didnt She tried to question his authority and he eventually just told her that it wasnt his job to parent her children That they should have more respect for his employees because every time they come into our establishment something happens and he always gets a call from her He said he would be glad to sit down with the owner the group of kids and parents and explain why he is requesting that they be banned from the propertyNow mind you I have just started working here I just moved and this is my third week I know nothing about the group that came in And this is the very first time I have ever worked with the awesome manager who threw them outEdit FormattingEdit  I took out the name calling It was pointed out how hypocritical and wrong that was And Im sorry for that guys,I might get fat like that girl over there Says the guy one table over while I clean our lobby Thanks just I what I needed,707
hungryeyes,63,120,1ht7c1,561,I work for a large pharmacy chain This story occurs on a Sunday when you can imagine we are pretty strapped for staff anyway and its not the regular weekday team working Somehow we always seem to get the really difficult customers on Sundays howeverSo on this particular Sunday the phone goes in the pharmacy five minutes after weve opened The Pharmacist answers and its a customer asking where her medication is For older customers we offer a delivery service whereby their medication is delivered to their house each month so they dont have to come into town to pick it up This particular customer had not received her medication and we were scouring the pharmacy and the computer system to find out whyWhilst everyone is looking the customer loudly complains to the pharmacist over the phone about the poor service of the company and then blurts out that shes called the police before and Im not afraid to do it againYes thats right she threatened to call the police because she hadnt received her medication yet The pharmacists response was something along the lines of mam the police cant help you unless its an emergency Her reply was it is an emergency Im dying clearly a gross exaggerationAs she continued with her abuse we eventually found our delivery list and realised that we had attempted to deliver her medication the day before but she wasnt in when the driver took it to her door So turns out it was actually really her fault anywayShe still needed her medication and was apparently unable to wait for it to be redelivered the next day so we had to call a taxi and asked the driver to deliver the prescription to her house The driver was not comfortable carrying a prescription without a member of staff so we ended up sending one of the pharmacy team in the taxi with him and we delivered it to her door Of course the store had to shell out for the cost of the taxi and from what I heard she wasnt even appreciative when we finally got the medicine to herI can understand she is old and needs her medication but to threaten to call the police and then not even apologise when it turns out it was her fault is pretty darn rude dont you think,Ive called the police before,681
Cyg,47,101,1dm5c1,560,Hi everyone first post so please let me liveThis story takes place roughly  years ago when I was in university and worked parttime for a fast food chain While it wasnt uncommoon for customers to be rude insulting behaviour towards and name calling of employees wasnt tolerated Legislation in that European country regarding so called offences against personal honor like libel and slander is strict and calling someone an asshole might result in prosection and having to pay the person you have insulted damages Also this whole get me you manager attitude isnt really common there either You deal with me and me alone and Ill throw you out if you dont behave Managers have better things to do with their timeIt was a Friday evening shift in town around pm Work was slow as partygoers werent expected until  or later I was the only one at the till my manager was standing behind me handing me whatever our customers ordered In came those two Turkish guys talking in Turkish about what theyd done this evening I greeted them politely and took their orders they wanted to eat in store Thats when one of them started telling the other one in Turkish how that blonde girl behind the till would certainly be a good fck how he knew for sure I would be easy to pick up since slutty till girls like me should be grateful for his attention etc etc Little did Mr Dumbass know that the one they were mocking could understand every single word they said I turned around looked at my manager  who was aware I knew Turkish  grinned and whispered Watch this I put their order on a tray let them pay looked at the one whod unsulted me and with the biggest smile on my face I told him in Turkish You know Im not so sure if my nonexistent Turkish husband or his family for that matter will be happy about the way you just insulted his wife Mr Douche got white as a sheet and started stammering It was awesome He and his friend basically grabbed their food and ran out of the store never to be seen again My manager couldnt stop laughing that evening I got an extra break and ice cream on top,The Turkish husband,661
Sweatersandcoffee,89,162,1numnh,554,Today I lost a little faith in society again I had picked up a cashier shift for some extra hours and it was actually a pretty good day Around am a woman comes through my line and as Im ringing her up someone who obviously knows her sees her and they talk a little As he walks away he shouts down an aisle asking her to buy him a pack of cigarettes She kinda brushes it off at first it sounded like he was joking This guy just kept pushing Finally she said if you cant pay child support I cant buy you cigarettes Oh god this guy is the baby daddy He makes some back handed comment about her new boyfriend trying to stir shit up  He asks her how shes buying all this food but she cant buy him cigarettes and she explained how she had food stamps he starts to throw a fit something like how could you do this to the father of your child all it is is a pack of cigarettes cmon please etc He finally stops and goes to the cashier on the other side of the kiosk At this point Im about done ringing her up and she gets  cash back out after paying for the non food items and makes me hide it because he came over to harass her some more He finally left she was obviously embarrassed and apologized I told her no one had to be embarrassed but him A grown man throwing a fit over a pack of cigarettes they were both early s Despite her situation she was a really nice person and didnt deserve that shit I wish I wasnt clocked in for that exchange I talked to the cashier that rang him up He had at least  in his wallet when he bought his own damn cigarettes Edit Title should say buy LifeProof phone case can make it hard to type,But me a pack of cigarettes,716
leveraction,39,132,1e1lmk,554,Way back when in the late s early s I worked night crew for a national grocery store chain The first thing the store manager told me when he promoted me to full time and overnights was that the night crew was filled with mutants perverts and mental defectives I soon found out that he was right but he neglected to tell me how entertaining the could be We used to start work at  PM the first thing we would do was break down all of the pallets and spot the load in the correct aisles We did this by making stacks of cases and then wheeling them to the correct spot in the correct aisle with two wheeled dollies We had two guys one named Booger and the other Snapper Booger was named that because he looked like a gross little troll and Snapper was a pervert that was rumored to snap his carrot in the mens room if he ever saw a hot looking customer They spent a lot of time busting on each other and playing practical jokes on each other While spotting the load one day Snapper noticed that Booger was only twenty feet or so behind him and heading in the same direction Snapper lifted weights and was on some high protein diet that gave him farts that smelled like something had died in his colon a few years ago and was trying to escape So Snapper lets one fly and Booger walks right through it He gets pissed and yells a bit About a half hour later Booger feels a good air biscuit building so he goes and finds Snapper He sees him go into an aisle  or  down from where he was He jogged up and caught sight of Snapper out of the corner of his eye He spotted Snapper at the close end of the aisle almost hidden by the large end cap display that was overflowing into the aisle Booger moved sideways and threw a hip into Snapper to hold him there while he rips out a fart that sounded like he needed to wipe afterwards Booger laughed and ran away before Snapper could beat the crap out of him The only problem was that when he made it to the end of the aisle he almost ran head on into Snapper coming the other way He took a quick look back down the aisle and spotted the shocked middleaged lady with the same color shirt on as Snapper standing at the end of the aisle wondering what the hell had just happened Booger went and hid and Snapper and I had to apologize to her for what had happened as the rest of the crew searched for the random drunk customer that had farted on her We had to spend about a half hour calming her down while Booger hid in the back of the deli department It was disgusting but hilarious and thankfully never got back to the store manager TLDR  I watched a fellow employee pin a customer to the side of an aisle and fart on her ,The Grossest Thing Ive Ever Seen An Employee Do,686

Betelgeuse,69,111,1qekfj,563,So I used to work at a Retail store that for the purposes of this story we shall call Paper Clips  This story will take some minor setup just to describe how the store is set up  We have one main desk that is at the front of the store and works like a customer servicecheckoutTech Support combo pack  To the right of the Front Desk is a oneway enter door that only opens to people entering the store  To the left side of the desk is the actual door that allows you to exit the store  Right in front of the service desk is our selection of tablets which as you can imagine is quite popular with they young kids and sort of allows the adults to shop in peace as their kids play gamesOn this particular day a Mom comes in with her  kidswell say the oldest was about  and the youngest  and starts shopping  The oldest of course immediately goes to the tablets and starts playing games oblivious to the rest of the world  The mother starts to finish her shopping and warns the kids to stop playing games and get ready to leave  The  year old boy of course ignores her completely absorbed in a game of Angry Birds or whatever he was playing  As I am checking this lady out her two youngest get ready to leave with their mom and abandon their games like good kids  She gives the oldest two more warnings by the time I finish up her order but he keeps playing and shrugs her offThis is where her Epic Parenting kicks in  She looks at me says thank you for ringing me up takes one last direct look at her oldest kid still playing the game frowns and and then leaves the store  I look at the oldest kid for a minute and watch her load up her bags and kids into the car  At this point I get worried cause I really dont want her to leave the kid behind too much paperwork  So I turn to the kid and say Hey kid  Your mom is leaving you behindNow then at the same time he turns around looks for his Mom she is actually slowly driving away in her car essentially looking like she is leaving him behind but not really  Kid goes into FULL PANIC mode and runs the wrong way to our door that only opens for incoming customers and realizing it isnt opening starts trying to pry it open with his bare hands like he is about to be killed by zombies or something  Kid also starts yelling for his mom and is almost in tears I am too but its because I am laughing so hard  Now our doors arent really heavy but for a  year old it would probably be like trying to pry open a steel trap  The mom meanwhile is slowly driving away along the front of our store  Im in tears laughing so hard and was about to help the kid but my Manager got there first and managed to flip the reset switch at the top of the door which made it open for the kid  The mother sees this happen and stops the car to let her kid catch up and jump in  I catch her gigantic smile as she drives off probably knowing he will never do something like that again  My manager looks at me confused as hell wondering what was going on and I tell him she was going old school parenting on him which gets a nod and smile from him as he goes back to the officeTldr Kid plays games and doesnt listen to mother and gets fake left behind to teach him a lesson  laughs were hadedit this is my first post ever,Epic Parenting,674

QWOPSparkle,85,101,1liz1h,556,Hello TRF I have a tale of a self entitled woman who believes she can speak to us all like were slaves because as I quote Im paying your wagesNow at the cinema I work at we very rarely ever ban anybody In the past  years Ive worked there we have only ever banned a small group of  teenage boys and that is because the final time they were kicked out they threatened to beat up our manager and knife him All because we wouldnt let them take a phone call in the screen YupNow let me tell you about this lady who in the past  months has caused nothing but hassle and weve had enough Most cinema chains across the UK have certain filming events on each week kids films for cheap prices silver screenings for pensioners for a discounted price etc This lady who I will call the AngryOreo for this story relevant is a regular to our pensioner film clubNow she isnt old shes in her early s but pensioners club is open to any age with the discount price still in place so its a bargain for anyone who has the time to come along and watch a particular film In the past  months shes caused a HUGE argument over the most ridiculous stuffThese first few moments I wasnt there for so I will explain from what I have been told from coworkers Years AgoAngryOreo decides she wants a job at the cinema Refuses to be interviewed by a manager and only wants to be interviewed by her friend who already works there Red flags going offFriend is allowed to interview as he had previous Supervisor position so long as assistant manager is thereAngryOreo answers all questions correctly to her friend except non of the questions were the right ones to be asked She didnt get the jobSo from then on she waited a while before coming back She came back with a vengeance Instance Number As a new regular for the Pensioner Films she thinks that her family can then abide against the lawShe brings her husband and two young teenage boys around the age of  to watch a filmgt AO  A family ticket for KickAss  gt CoWorker  Im sorry but I cant process family tickets as this is a  rated film Do your sons have ID with them to purchase teen ticketsgt AO  Wellno why should they Im a regular to the film club the manager knows me I should be allowed in without having my children IDdwutgt CW  Im sorry miss but I need to see ID because its the law Regardless of wether youre a regular or not we need to see ID before we can allow entry There are plenty of other films available that you can watch as a familygt AO  Im his mum I can vouch for them they can watch the film with me I say its okgt CW  But we cant miss We must see ID as it is labeled everywhere and it is the lawgt AO  So every time I come and see an age rated film they have to bring ID What a load of shit Storms outInstance For the Pensioners Film biscuits and other snacks are available for free with a limit of course For a while we tried out Oreos but they werent very popular They were going out of date and the only couple that got them were AngryOreo and her husband So we stopped providing them as it was costing money which could be spent on other snacks the rest of the regulars would enjoyAngryOreo wasnt pleasedgt weekAO Oh No Oreos this week Ill just wait until next weekgt weekAO  No Oreos again Can we have them next week pleasegt weekAO  Why have you stopped doing Oreosgt CW  Well they werent very popular with everyone else Youre welcome to bring your own Oreos in if that is what you personally prefergt AO  Whats the point of free snacks if you arent giving out OUR favourite snacks for free I dont want a biscuits Im not hungry now storms into screen giving CW the dirtiest look everYoure getting a discounted price for a film and FREE SNACKS WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ARGUE AGAINST THATInstanceThis actually happened to me personally I covered for the Pensioners Film I havent done this for a while as I usually have those particular shifts off so I was a bit rusty on certain things and timesSo of course Angry Oreo comes in after the adverts and trailers have finished I inform her from the time displayed on my monitor that the film had been on for literally  minute but she wouldnt have missed anything crucial Well thats not good enough now is itgt AO  What do you mean It says on your website it starts in  minutes shows me the times on her phone See So you fucked up What do you mean Im a minute late whats the point of me bothering nowgt Me  Im very sorry the website is run off a third party holder we arent in charge of the times that are written on there we merely pass our time information on and ocassionally mistakes do happen due to human error Were very sorry for the mistake this has caused but as I said the film has only been on for  minutegt AO  What a load of fucking shit This isnt good enough Its ridiculous I cant believe this Theres no point is there really I mean what the hell who the hell goes and watches a film after ITS ALREADY STARTEDShes raised her voice now and staring at me like its my fault shes missed the start of her film Im on my own as my other coworker is serving the snacks and the manager has gone to collect stock from the delivery driver I cant call for back up and this woman is getting in my face about this situation gt Me  Miss Im sorry I understand youre upset and Im sorry that the times were listed wrong on the site Sometimes the times do change bugt AO  Well no its not sorry really is it I have to come here half an hour fucking early every week now dont I Because I cant trust this fucking website Its not acceptable is it Is itAt this point her husband comes in with bought snacks guessing they decided to buy their own Oreos now and she tells them theres no point because theyre  minute late for the film so lets go home Saying it as loud as possible looking at me in the eye like she wants to murder me minutes later I relay this to the manager He says hell speak to her about her attitude next week as my coworker also heard shouting from the tills but couldnt leave their station to see what the issue wasInstanceAs some of you may or may not know it was bank holiday last week this usually messes up the delivery of our printed time sheet that usually goes out on an evening for the rest of the week So of course our time sheet was delayed by a day AngryOreo came in this week to see the new One Direction Documentary gag but of course the time she saw on the sheet were the old times and not the new ones So she goes ballistic at my coworkergt AO  You know what I cant trust the website I cant trust the time display outside I cant trust this cinema This is a fucking disgrace you know I pay your wages rightgt CW  Sorry miss but the times are never usually late its just with it being bank holiday the film starts half an hour later than what was previously listed so you wont have missed anythinggt AO  Doesnt change the fact I pay your wages Youre all disgracesgt CW   If the issue is bothering you this much miss I can call out the manager and he can explain it to you in persongt AO  No thanks Im very good friends with the general manager so Ill speak to her at the next Pensioner Screening about how disgraceful you all areAnd with that she took her tickets and walked to the screenLittle does she know that when she comes in this week for the Pensioner Screening she will be banned for coming back for being disrespectful to staff members swearing in front of guests and being a general cuntThe best thing is Ill be there when it happensIll keep you all posted Edit  Update postedhttpredditlwov,Rude to

Clasikrocker,177,87,14hxr1,552,I work at a computer store that sells Apple products  We sell lots of iPads and a fair amount of laptops  So when a woman calls us with questions about getting an iPad Im happy to help her out so she can get the best fit for her needsHowever she asks every question that could ever be asked about an iPad as well as every question ever considered in regards to Wifi and G   minutes later I hang up thinking I have helped her make a final decision  She calls back  more times each time with another quick question  In total I spend  hours on the phone with herThe next day someone walks into the store  I can tell shell be a problem customer so I go into the back to get some water Ive gained the ability to recognize terrible people from at least  feet away  When I come back out shes nowhere to be seen so I go on helping other people  About an hour later my coworker comes off the floor to get a manager  As he passes me he says This ladys killing me  Shes been talking to him for an hour about iPads  It turns out he basically had to repeat everything I had told her on the phone  She also talks to our manager for another hour again being told the exact same informationAt this point she decides she wants to get a MacBook Air because she didnt realize the iPad didnt have a physical keyboard   We get the inventory sheets and warranty stuff all set up and are about to swipe her card when she decides that she doesnt want it because it doesnt have G on it  Someone tells her she could get a mobile hotspot from her cellular carrier if that was important for her  So she stands at the desk for an hour as she calls verizon to ask them every question ever conceived in relation to G mobile hotspot  Eventually she decides to go through with the order  We all think shes left  However  minutes later she storms up to the desk as Im in the middle of processing a huge iPad mini order and demands to know why anyone would make a laptop with one USB port  After lots of ridiculousness with this she buys a USB hub and leaves  About  minutes later we get a phone call from herShe had read all of the fine print on the back of her receipt after she got home and saw that we dont accept computer returns after  days in cases where people just decide they dont like the computer  She says Only  days  But what if there is a manufacturing defect  What if I need it repaired a month from now   days  So I calmly explain to her what a warranty is at the store she had purchased applecare coverage after getting a lengthy explanation of what that entailed  She seems satisfied and hangs up  At the end of my shift I bet my coworker that shell either show up in the store first thing the next morning or call us as soon as we open  He laughs and says no wayWe opened at  this morning  At  the phone starts ringing  The shrill sound reverberates through the chilled emptiness that is the sales floor on a Saturday morning in December like a Banshees screech echoing across the moors  Behold it is her  She has called to complain about the fact that Windows  is not the operating system on AN APPLE COMPUTER  We tell her about parallels Windows for Mac and hang up  She shall surely return  And we will be readyUPDATE   SHE JUST SHOWED UP  Im about to go help her  Ill update when she leavesUPDATE  So she came back in saying that she was concerned about the processing power of the inch air she bought because word processing takes up so much power  She also wanted to know if she could put the different models in her purse to see how they were in terms of size despite playing on a display model for an hour before she bought it yesterday  I couldnt handle it so I said she would have to go talk to someone at the desk across the room as I cant leave my desk right now  She shuffles across the room and I can see the terror in my colleagues eyes as he realizes the horror which is about to befall him  He talks with her for a bit explaining how she is worried about the processor speed and she doesnt think the inch screen will be big enough for her eyes because peoples eyes get tired  My coworker listens to her explain her every thought in deciding how to consider her purchase and then says she can do whatever she wants with the demo models but hes going back to the sales desk  He then CLOCKS OUT AND LEAVES so he wont have to deal with her anymore  Later she left but then walked back in to ask me what the exact dimensions of an iPad retinas screen are  I said about inches but she had to know EXACTLY how tall it was so I went and looked it up the device is inches tall  Apparently that wasnt acceptable so she left without saying anything further  Oh how I hope this is the end  Im sure shell come on Monday though,Apple Nightmare,639
wishiwasyou,32,131,1ou0by,553,I work in a medium to high end furniture store as a sales person  Two women walk in and I greet them  One asks me where the restroom is and points her friend in that direction then begins to shop  While her friend is in the bathroom she picks out a desk she wants to purchase  I bring her up to the counter and while we are getting the order written up and paid for her friend joins us  Her face is completely flushed red and she has this vacant look in her face  There was definitely something wrong or off about her  Her friend noticed her face and said Oh hun you are so upset  Your face is so red  The other woman blurts out I didnt make it  I peed my pants  You cant tell can you  It wasnt a lot it was just a little bit  It was a lot and yes you could tell  The woman then begins to become upset begging her friend We dont have to go home do we  Just because I peed  The other woman goes on to tell me that her husband died and that her son is an asshole which has gotten her upset  They begin to pull out their phones and show me pictures of them  The ladies leave to go get their nails done  Pissy jeans and all  Just another Saturday in retail,She didnt make it,684
WinnifredBurkle,105,130,17ephp,548,So I spent some time working for a childrens play place and pizza restaurant chain when I was in high school and college I dealt with lots of crazy stuff see previous post and comments but some of the craziest customers were birthday party moms I live in a moderately sized southern town with some overly entitled southern housewives They were the worst Not like Pinterest moms now who go overboard doing everything homemade oh no These ladies wanted the best for their kids but they absolutely did not want to pay for it and would throw the biggest fit in the history of fits when given their final bill One particular mom stands out more than others but some backstory first We offered different party packages some with more emphasis on the games and winning tickets and some focusing more on the maze Two of the packages we offered had pizzas at a discounted price along with maze admission for a set number of kids and some tokens The main difference between the two was how many kids were included how many tokens you got and wether or not a party hostess helped with your party Before I became shift manager and sometimes after I was a party hostess For the most part I loved it It was fun to do my little skit with the mascot and cut the cake and I got sweet tips for it too Most parents were thankful for the help and the chance to enjoy their childs party Others were not so nice This mom had purchased the most expensive package It came with admission for  kids with admission discounted for any extras two discounted pizzas somefree tokens the party hostess me and interaction with the mascot Great I check her in go over token prices and additional food prices give her her  wristbands for the guests she assures me that no more than that will be coming and start to get things together in the party area I find out from my coworker up front that more and more kids come in for this party At first she tries to sneak them in but we had the wristbands for a reason easy identification for who didnt pay and made her add additional ones to her party ticket She ended up having FORTY kids total come on her ticket It takes a while but I get everything set up for forty kids I check and double check with the kitchendid this woman order any extra pizza for her gigantic party They assure me that no she did not I ask again twice before I call them back and the kitchen finally assures me that the two discounted pizzas we talked about at check in were all she ordered I assume that the other parents were going to order food for themselves and their children as unfair as that would be and call them back So the forty kids come back all flushed and excited from doing the kid thing and immediately see that theres a problem None of the other parents had ordered food and these kids are starving The fatass birthday kid grabs three pieces for himself because its his birthday and he can do that which leaves  pieces of pizza for  kids and all their parents The party mom storms over and asks where her other pizzas are I tell her that we made all the pizzas shed ordered No shed ordered more she insists Do you think Im stupid Why would I have forty kids and only two pizzas You should have know and made them anyway even if I didnt order themMaam Im sorry but we cant just make pizzas without a ticket Id be happy to place an order for you but itll be a while before theyre ready and your allotted time in the party area will be over Im terribly sorry what would you like me to doShe blows up Well I would have really liked it to not have an idiot take care f my sons party I cant feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas It was a ridiculously busy day and I had at least two more parties to do after hers so I decided if she was going to act that way she wasnt going to have a party hostess I got my boss who explained he was sorry about the pizzas but we had no way of knowing that she wanted more I guess now we could have asked her but how is that our responsibility And what if a kid had had an allergy or something and thats why she didnt order more I mean who knows He offered her hot dogs as an easy way of feeding every guest quickly but she got even more pissed when she found out shed have to pay for them even at a discount I didnt go back to that party until they had all left but I did over hear her bitching about the fact that they didnt get enough free tokens with their party package She bought some more eventually and flipped her shit when she got the final bill I dont think she realized that my boss included a tip for me for having to put up with her and her forty guests in the bill She probably would have come back and burned the place down ,I cant feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas,678

Itryhardish,91,100,1irt5f,547,I told this story to my buddy yesterday and he said it belonged hereSo Im a  year old white female working at a gas station which is pretty rare around here so I pretty much hear lewd and suggestive comments every day but this was a first for meI work morning shifts alone on the weekends Im the assistant manager so during the week I either have one or two people with me so it would figure that this would happen on a Saturday It was sometime in the afternoon between  and  when a male and a female walk into my store Its in the middle of Satans butthole hot July right now so the first thing I notice when the guy walks in is his long coat Not a trench coat just long I didnt really pay them any mind since I was in the middle of helping a couple of other customers at the moment I did happen to glance at the car they had just come from and noticed three other guys in the car all white and around mid to late s They were simply pumping gas so I ignore them tooSo this guy is shuffling around picking up random shit to look at while his counterpart walks to the bathroom in the back A woman and her son walk in to pay for some gas really quickly so I handle that while still pretty much not paying attention to the guy even though something looked kind of off about him I check out the mother and she and her kid exits the store leaving the place empty except for me coat man and the girl who must obviously be having some issues because she still hasnt come back out of the bathroomI finally shift my attention to coat man and ask him if he needs help or is looking for something specific He mumbles something I cant hear so I lean forward and ask him to kindly speak up He says yeahI need some fresh air Then he kind of awkward jumphops to directly in front of me and flings his jacket wide open This is when I realize what looked so weird about him He was wearing a long coat but I could still see his bare legs It just looked awkwardSo there he stands in front of me in his birthday suit with his little noodle still flopping around in a semi circle from his little hop So I stand there and stare in shock for a solid three seconds and take in this dudes small frame with tiny little milk dud looking nipples and teeny little tootsie roll tinkiewinkie Then with a force that was physically painful I burst out laughingNow when I say burst I dont mean I brayed loudly No Im talking about pure raw laugh diarrhea that was so forceful that spittle flew out of my mouth To make it worse for him I covered my mouth and pointed at him It was laughter so hard that noise stopped coming out of me and Niagara Falls started streaming from my eyeballs A look of hurtshock flashes across his face and a dark crimson color starts setting in By this time it was too late for me I couldnt stop myself Finally the noise caught up with my laughter and I just threw my head back and heehawed until I was pretty sure I was going to be sick Hearing all of the commotion the girl busts out of the bathroom takes in the situation and then takes up my laughter with me By this time the guy is clutching his coat around his body like a nervous first time lover Through a wave of tears I see the other passengers outside laughing and bouncing around so much while pointing at us that the whole car is rocking back and forthThe dude spins around to make a quick getaway and runs face first into the glass door The girl comes to his rescue and helps his out of the store in a half jog to their car On the way there he stumbles over the curb He catches his balance but the back of his jacket flew up exposing his bare white ass I lost itAt this point Im pretty sure my laugh sounds diseased because my vocals were so scratchy and I couldnt catch my breath Im pretty sure the guy was crying as I caught one last glimpse of his face during their hurried retreat It took me a long time to regain my composure It didnt help that everyone that came in for the next hour asked me if I was ok since my face was all puffed up and my eyes were completely bloodshot I would tell them what happened and we would have a good laugh together In pretty sure I lost  pounds by the end of the day TLDR Mr Teeny weeny peeny tried to flash his jewels and I laughed him to the brink of suicide  ,It was either laugh or cry,647
dignamlive,26,91,1a8zfz,550,Hey guys I currently work at a petrol station that is part of a large chain I have worked for the company for almost two years I started at a store close to where I live but while working at this store my manager was just horrible Ill call her Sue Sue would constantly berate me while working for the smallest mistakes Mostly for no reason though Nothing I did was good enough for her and she was a complete control freak She would put me down as well she always asked if I did well in school and if I had trouble concentrating When I told her I did well she said I dont believe you you cannot even understand simple directions you must have learning issues I was actually a decent worker but for some reason she hated me If I was at the console keeping an eye on the forecourt she would yell at me to stock If it wasnt busy and I was stocking she would yell at me for not paying attention to the forecourt It was miserable working for her not to mention she only gave me  hour shifts The one good thing about working at the store was one of my coworkers lets call him Steve Steve was awesome He was a middleaged man who was just the nicest guy ever Really funny and awesome to work with Anyway Sue just plain hated me and was trying her best to get me fired Eventually I fucked up and made a mistake so she managed to get me to do a Performance Review with the Area Manager present During this meeting she had listed all the mistakes I made the majority of them were during my first week or two learning the ropes She was also claimed I was lazy never did my duties etc which was all bullshit I didnt really contest any of this I knew I would get a strike on my record anyway I did Strike One three strikes and you get fired They have to give you three written warnings until they can fire you thats company policy Unless of course you do something really bad like steal something from the store So the next day after the meeting Sue comes up to me and says If I could have fired you now I would have Since I cant Im going to cut your hours to zero So she cuts my hours but this ends up being a blessing I have a friend who works for the company at another store and he gives my number to his manager so he can use me to cover shifts at his store I cover some shifts for him and he loves me He loves that I am flexible and willing to work and says I am a good worker He gives my number to other stores because I have zero hours at my home site so Im almost guaranteed to cover a shift After a few weeks I am working the maximum amount of hours I can work I have to turn down at least  shifts a week because it will put me into overtime I start covering a lot of shifts at the store I currently work at and the manager loves me so requests for me to be transfered Sue of course approves it as she is no doubt glad to get rid of me My manager has no problem with me and thinks Im a great worker Go figure I am finally free from her grasp and I now work at a great store with an awesome manager and coworkers A few nights ago I start talking to my old coworker Steve on Facebook I havent heard from him in months He tells me Sue has been fired She was fired for abusing customers workplace bullying and sending abusive text messages to coworkers Sweet sweet justice has been served even if it took almost a year ,Horrible ExManager finally gets what she deserves Long post,641
sexcamel,82,121,199p7j,546,I work at a casino and just like any retailcustomer service job on a Saturday we were getting killed I work the front desk where we issue free slot play comps etc and it was one of those days where the line would Not End As soon as we helped one guest which due to our complicated rules and promotions takes about  minutes of continuous talking and explaining for most customers another  guests would be getting in line to hear the same shtick A normal Saturday consists of about  hours of thisAnyway a few hours into my shift and with the madness showing no sign of ending a customer that I had just finished helping was stepping away from the desk Out of nowhere this woman rushed up cutting in line I might add  a huge pet peeve of mine on nonstop days and IMMEDIATELY copped an attitude pointing a finger in my face she said I had security call me an ambulance but I dont WANT this ambulance I want you to call me a NEW ambulance because the driver of this one is giving me ATTITUDE For a second I was stunned into silence I mean I have heard some ridiculous complaints at my job but this was by far the most ludicrous My immediate thought was that if this lady was well enough to demand multiple ambulances she wasnt sick enough to need one in the first place So I responded maam if this is an emergency you need to take the ambulance that is waiting for you or call  yourself and see if they will send a different one which I doubt they will do If its not an emergency I cant let you cut in front of all these people who have been waiting Her eyes bulged madly for a second before she demanded that I find the security guard who had called the first ambulance and ask that security guard to call a second one I told her that I could not do that either that security would not call a second ambulance for the same guest At that point she SLAMMED her hand down on the counter and screamed Well if YOU cant do that for me I want you to find someone who CAN I glanced at my coworker sitting at the computer next to me rolled my eyes and look back at Belligerent Lady Before I could even open my mouth she shrieked Are you ROLLING YOUR EYES DID YOU JUST ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME To which I calmly replied yes I am rolling my eyes at you stood up and called to my manager to call security I guess Belligerent Lady didnt think she could get away with bullying the security guards either because she yelled a little bit more about how she was just trying to have a conversation with me and this was my overreaction then she scuttled offEpilogue The same lady came back later that day demanding to see my name tag so that she could report me I held it up to her face and said Sure its sexcamel make sure you dont forget the underscore I have an unusual name so this was particularly satisfying Nothing has come of it since except my coworkers and I all got a good laugh about it later,Woman demands a second ambulance after the driver of the first one gave her attitude,667

Ratava,79,130,1bp7g5,545,This story comes from my first retail job as a young man at the tender impressionable age of  working for a pharmacy chain that later got bought out by another larger chain resulting in two pharmacies of the same company just down the block from each other in locations all over the countryOn this particular night I was the only one working the front register for the first time I wasnt at the pharmacy just the cash register for people who only needed milk or chips orwhatever We only had two registers anyway but there was no one else helping me out today and my manager was in the back working on something It was a slow night so I didnt mind until in walked the largest man Ive ever seen in my lifeHe was probably five hundred pounds in a tight white tshirt that had numerous sweatstains and what looked like barbeque sauce smeared across his expansive belly Also he had on extremely short denim cutoff shorts YuckHe came through the doors saw me standing alone at the register grinned and walked right over to me Hi is this a pharmacy he askedI pointed to the sign over my head which read PHARMACY IN BACK and said Yes we have a pharmacy its in the back Our store wasnt very big I could see the pharmacy from the front counter about a hundred feet away tops If he had just turned around he would have seen it He didnt even look up at the sign let alone turn around to see the pharmacyHe said Thats great thank you so do you guys like do tests on pills or something To see what kind of pill it isThats a question I hadnt yet come across It was my first night alone and my impulse was to pick up the phone to ask the pharmacy but I decided I could do this I am a retail employeeI said I dont believe thats something we do here We do have a pharmacist in the back who can definitely talk to you about that but I imagine youd have to send it to a lab or something to get testedHe said OK because you know the Internet Well I bought ten dozen packs of cheap Viagra but Im afraid to take one because what if its not Viagra you know So what do you think I should doI stammered something like Well you could just take one and um see if things wellHe didnt even seem to be listening to my response just grinned and thanked me for my answer and then said without breathing OK I have another question my friend told me about I read online I heard something about Vibrating condoms Do those exist Where can I get oneTrying to keep a neutral face I said We actually sell them here Not quite vibrating condoms but condoms that come with a vibrating ring Theyre on the condom rack back by the pharmacy Again I pointed to the sign above my headSo how are those he askedSorryHow are those Do the ladies like them You seem like quite the stud have you tried them outNow not only was I a painfully virginal  year old Im also gay so asking me about the ladies would not really get you a good answer even nowI said something like I havent gotten the chance to try them out yet and reminded him that they were on the rack in the backHe waddled down the center of the store toward the pharmacy looking back at me as he walked When he reached the condom rack he stopped and looked back I nodded He looked at the rack for half a second looked back at me and shrugged comically I tried to motion that they were on the bottom of the rack but he just shrugged again and then waved me to come backLike I said the store was very small and there was no one else there I figured what the hell locked my register and walked back to himI bent down and picked up the two boxed varieties we had and handed him one of each He asked Whats the differenceI said One is Durex one is TrojanHe said OK whats the difference Describe them to mePainfully virginal gay and also naive But at this point I realized that he wasnt actually just shopping for vibrating condoms he was enjoying having me help him pick them outI read off the basic description on the front of the box which was identical across both brands  Three lubricated condoms  plus one vibrating ringWhich one should I get he asked Ill trust youI handed him the more expensive boxExcellent he said and followed me back up to the registerI quickly rang the box up and told him his total but he made no move to pay meSo how do these work he askedUm its a condom plus a vibrating ring I answeredOK but like how do I use itI picked up the box to read the instructions on the back to see if there was anything there that I could use so this didnt need to get any more awkward but the directions were full of phrases like base of the penis which I definintely was not interested in sayingSo thats when I said Sir Im not going to demonstrate the use of a condom for you I reiterated his total and slightly chagrined he paid meAs he was leaving he said Maybe these will finally get her off that goddamned pill How long will you be here Are you still going to be here in twenty minutes or so Ill come back and let you know how it wentI told him I was actually leaving for the day immediately even though I still had hours upon hours left and to have a nice day I never saw him againThe second the door whooshed shut behind him my phone rang It was the pharmacist  Did that man just have you pick out condoms for him Oh girl I said You have no ideaEDIT Yards was supposed to be feet Apologies,Sir I will not demonstrate the use of a condom for you,675

Vamprimosa,33,110,1fo28a,545,Preface This story happened a little over a year ago I work for a small conveniencedrug store Our store is located near the local school for the blind so we regularly have visually impaired customers in our store that we assistIt was the middle of allergy season and I was working the front register I have terrible allergies and I get unreasonably sick at least twice a year from them My throat was sore and my voice raspy at the beginning of my shift but as the day wore on it worsened After  hours into my shift my voice had gone from raspy to squeaky to nonexistent It was extremely difficult for me to even make the most basic of sounds Not wanting to lose any of my hours for the week I pushed through and made a sign that I taped to the counter saying something along the lines of I have lost my voice I will communicate as best I can Sorry for the inconvenience This was working pretty well for most of the customers most apologizing and telling me they hoped that I get better soon Everything was running smoothly with no real problems until one of our blind customers comes inHe was a semiregular customer who also has Aspergers It was getting late in the evening and business had died down I was completely alone at the front of the store He comes up to my counter and starts screaming HELLO as loudly as he possibly can I try to speak but nothing comes out He keeps screaming HELLO IS ANYONE THERE I wind up banging my hands on the counter to let him know Im there but my ability to communicate stops after that I push one of our alert buttons at the front register to try and signal my coworkers but no one responds Im at a loss for what to do until another customer gets in line behind the blind the customerHe notices something is off about our interaction seeing as the blind the customer is still standing there screaming HELLO I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME So I motion to the customer behind him in line to read the sign taped to my counter He reads the sign stops himself from giggling and tells the blind customer that I am there but that I have lost my voice The blind customer then starts to apologize profusely and then starts listing off a couple of items he wanted I run to grab them then come back to ring him up This was also an ordeal because this customer always wants to run the card himself but since it is a touch screen he cant read the responses or feel the buttons The customer behind him who was very patient had to help me guide him through the payment options He left shortly after still apologizing profusely My manager came to the front at the tail end of this transaction He sent me home shortly afterDefinitely my most sitcom worthy storyTLDR Blind customer comes into my store while I have lost my voice Hilarity ensues,The mute leading the blind,655

nerveendingstory,117,120,1lsh0z,544,A few years back I worked at a convenience store I worked there for about  months in order to make a little extra money The overall experience was great We had regular customers that I got to know and conversed with on an everyday basis The manager was warm and friendly and was a favorite among the customers and employeesThe store I worked at was never busy but on this night it was packed I had a very long line of people waiting to check out A woman walked in and went straight to the side of the desk and just stared at me until I acknowledged her I look her way and she says The manager told me I could pick up my cigarettes now I had just seen my manager before I started my shift and she didnt say anything about a customer coming to pick up cigarettes so I politely told her that I had no knowledge of this She immediately gets defensive and goes into this story of how she came in earlier that day and paid for cigarettes and the manager said she could pick them up later that night I have no idea why anyone would do this for any reason I tell her without any kind of note or mangagers consent I couldnt just give her a pack of cigarettes She replies with Oh its because Im black huh At this point my blood starts to boil I keep my cool because I am still checking out customers while this is going on I grit my teeth a little and say Maam You know thats not what this is about She tells me to call the manager because shes not leaving without her cigarettes I excused myself from the customer checking out and called my manager I explained the situation She says that she has no idea what this person is talking about but to give her the cigarettes just to get her out of the store My jaw dropped I grab the pack and handed it to her I didnt say another word to her just glared She said Mmm hmmm thats what I thought Watching her walk out of the store I felt defeated The customers in line showed a lot of sympathy one even offered to pay for the packI still get mad just thinking about it to this day I know why my manager did it but I lost a lot of respect for her giving in to a liar,Mmm hmmm thats what I thought,664

ProPatriaMori,104,120,19bytq,535,I used to be the assistant manager at a liquor store  One day the drain of the grocery cooler got clogged one of those open coolers without any doors that hold  packs and  packs  My GM sent one of the stock guys to the hardware store to get  huge jugs of industrial strength drain cleaner containing HCl  After pouring both jugs into the drain to no avail the GM then decided to try another cleaning product  Im sure most of you are already thinking to yourselves theres no way he could be so stupid as to mix bleach with one of the strongest acids available for public sale  Its common sense to not mix random cleaning products together  And it even says right on the bottle in very large letters DO NOT MIX THIS PRODUCT WITH ANY OTHER CHEMICAL ESPECIALLY BLEACH this is literally the first line of the warning labelSo I walk into the store at the beginning of my shift and the entire store is filled with a noxious chemical gas  My eyes immediately start to water and I can feel it burning in my lungs  I ask my boss what the hell happened the GM points to the handy man and says it was his fault the handy man points back at GM and says it was all his idea Not only did the GM mix HCl and bleach together line  of the warning label  He then poured hot water into the drain as well line  of the warning label which created steam and enabled the Chlorine gas to spread throughout the store fasterIn way of apology he ended up giving everyone who worked that day a  bottle of Scotch and some other random bottles of beer and liquor  edit bluerose pointed out that its redundant to say HCl and I exaggerated by saying the cleaner was straight HClSeveral people have claimed that they only make drain cleaners with bases or that they dont make drain cleaners using HCl  Most common drain cleaners are made with bases but the strongest ones on the market contain HClhttpwwwmeridianengcomdrainclehtml,The day my GM decided to make chemical weapons,655

Heznarrt,93,117,1ho6yi,529,I am a calm person I have won customer service awards in multiple retail companies I have been working retail for  years in both sales and management I have worked at  different retail companies but for privacy sakes I wont say their names Suffice it to say one was a convenience store one was a popular electronic retail chain and the other where I currently work is a cell phone store This event happened a few months agoSo Im working in the cell phone store one day lets call it a Saturday and its just me and the new guy The New Guy knows what he has to do but doesnt have much experience so Im there until  hour before we close so the new guy can have closing experience but with me there in case it gets busy before closing or the new guy needs help with something So I bought my ticket for The Evil Dead for an hour after I got off time to get to the theater concessions etcMidday  hours before Im supposed to leave an old woman walks in with a stack of papers And when I say old I mean she has a drivernursecare giver walking with her this woman was in her s the nurse looked to be ss She has a flip phone and tells me she wants a smart phone in case she ever gets lost for GPS reasons The nursecaregiverwhatever only spokewell Im not sure what it was but neither me nor the new guy spoke it The old woman was Asian so perhaps it was an Asian language all I know is that it wasnt English or SpanishAnyways before I can get a word in on usual pitches she lists a bunch of phones she wants to try This is where happy normal ends At each cell phone she asks to try out she asks to hold it then asks me to do something on the phone whether its to check email GPS weather etc It would go something like thisOld Crabby Can you show me how to launch the weatherMe Ok pushes the weather app icon for herOld Crabby smacks my handOld Crabby Let me do itYes She told me to do it for her then slapped and yelled at me for me doing it But hey we make commission in my store so whatever as long as I get a sale This went on for about an hour trying out every single phone in the store Eventually she settled on the Galaxy Note because of its big screen and her vision issues Then I see her go through her paperwork and bring out dozens of flyers As I look I see that even though there are dozens of flyers there are multiples There were only two kinds of flyers in there The flyer for the competitor placing the phone at half price than normal A flyer for out store again showing the Note for a sale price thats  higher than the st flyer showedShe then demands that I give her the sale price of the other store Now I notice this flyer is for the company I worked for before where I work now I really dont want to say names but like I said this company is a very popular nation wide electronics store I also realize what kind of sale this is Theyll advertise a great price for the week and only have  units or so per store So I mention this to her she accuses me of being a liar then demands I call their stores and ask for their inventory information Im a little ticked off at this point mostly as she wasted my hour she knew what phone she wanted and I just wanted to say Well go to their store and leave me alone However Im management so I decided to be polite diplomatic and take it like a weak new guy in a prison shower I call up every store they have in a  mile radius of our store AND this womans apartment and everyone is sold out So she decides to buy it from me finally something good out of thisIt takes half an hour to run her credit as she didnt trust me with her social security number mailing address although she wanted me to setup her billing too andthe phone number she wants on her phone So whatever I had her call customer service to setup her account over the store phone because apparently saying it all out loud with me next to her was safer She gets approved I go to setup her phone and at this point shes been in the store a good two hours Old Crabby You should give me the competitor sale price thats what youre supposed to doMe Im sorry miss but our sale is the only price I can give youOld Crabby But youve kept me here for two hours already What about customer satisfaction yes this is what she saidMe Im sorry miss But if you want this phone today the price will be and I told her the exact price with sales taxOld Crabby Oh fineSo I setup her phone get her number sent over and transfer the pictures and contacts from her old flip phone to her new one Old Crabby I need you to show me how to use this phoneSo remember earlier she would hold up the display and make me explain every feature while hitting me Yeah there was another hour of thatBy the time I was done explaining the phone she yelled at me for keeping here there  hours yes she blamed me for everything and no it hadnt even been  hours and demanded to file a complaint with my manager Thats when I pulled off my name badge and handed it to her so she could look closely and see the Manager titleShe said she had to use the bathroom and walked away leaving her new phone on the counter The new guy who watched the whole thing in stunned silence looked at me and said You know we closed thirty minutes ago rightYup Not only was I stuck at work a good  minutes past when I shouldve but my movie started thirty minutes ago She comes out of the bathroom makes me reexplain a few basics then leads while cursing me We closed as quickly as we could and I ended up locking up the store right around the time the movie ended Luckily AMC agreed to exchange my ticket for a later showing so I could still see my movieA few days later it turned out she was the  out of every  customers who gets a survey call She gave me the lowest possible rating because he didnt give me the price OTHER STORE NAME was selling the phone for as well as other things about how I kept her there didnt setup her phone etc The new employee backed up my store exactly and my boss yes I am a store manager this guy runs all the stores in the area looked at me Now this is a nice guy He doesnt curse he doesnt say derogatory names and hes very peaceful and respectful He looked at me and said Damn how did you resist hitting this bitchTLDR Customer was a confused old woman and worst than every other customer Ive ever had combined,You kept me here for  hours,646

sooverit,140,101,188iy4,528,I work for a company that owns several parking ramps throughout the downtown area of my city  My job is sort of an operations supervisor  I supervise the booth attendants who are on the front line selling the parking tickets to customers as they enter the ramps I dispense and track all of the money coming in and out I coordinate with security and dispatchers to ensure things are running smoothly and I fix any and all machinery that breaks downTonight there was an event that brought in  people  In addition there were several smaller events plus your typical Saturday night bar crowd types  Nearly every ramp we have was completely full  Tonight was probably in the top five busiest nights in all of my time working there  Despite that the night went relatively smoothly until the end  Most people were orderly and not causing massive traffic backups there were only minor issues with the machinery and even the least competent of my employees were keeping their heads together and doing their jobs wellThen the big event let out   people were trying to leave the parking ramps all at the same time  Inevitably there are backups in the ramps and it can take a long time for people to get out  In this case it was about an hour which is actually pretty extraordinary for an event of this type  To put that in perspective there was an event about half the size last night and it took over two hours for everyone to get out of the rampsSecurity and booth attendants are stationed at all of the ramps to help customers exit  It may seem like exiting a parking ramp should not be a complicated thing but thousands of drunken people who are all pumped up from the event that they just left make it very complicated  Most people are very excited about the event they just attended and they are happy and joyful and funny and quite drunk  Some people are very very pissed off about how long they had to wait in the ramp to exit  Most of the pissed off people just make some snide comments about how poorly we are running things and I just smile at them and tell them to drive safely  A few people take things to the extremeThe ramp I was in has two exits on opposite sides  I had a security officer at the top end directing traffic to each exit  I was assisting at one exit and a booth attendant was assisting at the other  There was one gentleman in particular who drove me to post this tonight  I have dealt with all sorts of unreasonably angry people during my time at this job but never have I experienced anyone like this beforeNear the end of the line is this person who is reaching the security officer who is directing traffic  He is so drunk and angry about waiting that he is visibly shaking  Even from my spot  yards away I can see how worked up he is  He stops his car gets out he is now blocking everyone behind him from exiting walks up to my security officer and begins screaming in his face  He is losing his mind so thoroughly that spit is flying from his mouth as he yells  I see my security officer about to lose his patience with the guy so I rushed up to try and diffuse the situationWhen I get to them I ask what the problem is  The guy yells Ill tell you what the fucking problem is you fucking bitch and cold cocks me right in the face  He seriously just punches me across the mouth  Before today Id never been punched in the face and I have to tell you that it really really hurtsI fell to the ground dazed and the security officer jumps on the guys back to keep him from further attacking me all while calling for other security to back us up and for a dispatcher to call the police  The rest of it is rather fuzzy for me as Im sort of small and not exactly used to being punched in the face but the two of them scuffle for a while until the cops show up  They arrested the guy and I went off to the hospital  Nothing in my face is broken just good and bruised up  I am also on some pretty fun painkillers  I told the police that I would in fact like to press charges and the man is sitting in a jail cell right now as I type thisI know this is not exactly retail in the traditional sense of selling merchandise in a store but we do sell parking spaces and I could not think of a subreddit that is a more appropriate place to tell my story  I hope you all enjoyed it,How I ended up being attacked by a customer tonight,629

JacOfAllTrades,110,123,11c8l2,527,I work in a high end home furnishings store which is unfortunately located in a mall meaning we get teenagers gtlt Most of the time they just wander in and pretend they can afford something until you ask if they need help at which point they quickly bolt out the door but this story starts with a group of teens that evidently were raised without boundaries Im somewhat notorious in the store for not tolerating boorish behavior any more than one MUST and when these kids came in I was called over the headset to keep an eye on themAt first they poked around like most do but within a few minutes they were hiding in the hanging rugs and drapes on flappers Due to the fact that the flappers have large metal handles that protrude out of the cove this is actually somewhat dangerous and frankly if you are older than  dont expect to get away with that I walked over gave them my very best putupon look and said You are in a place of business either respect that or leave They seemed incredulous so I followed that up with Now They all came out from between the flappers with the classic Moms Nagging looks on their faces but they went back to poking around for a couple of minutesI suppose they thought I had stopped watching after scolding them but once they disappeared around the corner toward our display beds I waited about  seconds before following  seconds When I came around the corner all of them were IN as in under the covers and all a display bed more specifically in the ALL WHITE bed Oh temper temperAt this point I was done amusing them and I walked over threw back the duvet coverlet and sheets and went full mom on them pointing to the far corner of the space and ordering Out Right this second They laughed so I smirked right back then called over my headset Call the police we have destruction of property Oh their faces went paleThis is where the explanations began  We didnt hurt anythingThis is  of white bedding you just stuck your nasty dirty bodies in shoes greasy hair and all You get to explain to your parents why you owe this store money Come on were sorry Let us goToo little too late I told you once respect my business You cant respect that you pay the consequences Youre bluffing security will just kick us outI didnt tell them to call security I told them to call the cops Im friends with the cops here and the damage is over  you wanna bet all youre getting is kicked outThe fourth one had enough fear or sense to keep his mouth shut By chance the main mall officer who is an actual cop for the city there are generally  in the mall at all times if not more happened to be outside in his car and I spotted him through the window as he was coming in to respond Fortunately he also spotted me and the four trapped children and I saw the smirk that said fun was about to happenHe made them all sit on the floor while he wrote up a report on the damages and when one teen spouted off Im outta here the officer put his hand on his cuffs and said You wanna rethink that All in all these kids had to sit on the floor for the better part of an hour then the officer said they were all going to jail At this point both girls started bawling and one of the guys looked like he mightIt was really really hard not to laughThe officer told them he was going to run a background check on all of them and if it was a first offense he might not take them to jail all fictitious of course He escorted all of them to the holding facility in the mall spent about  minutes shopping in my store then eventually called their parents  kids were made to apologize to me and the officer by their parents and each parent chipped in money to pay for the damagesNow before anyone tells me what a crotchety old woman I am Im  years old and these kids were  and  If I had ever even thought about acting like that I would have got my butt busted and the fact that these kids collectively decided it was fine is just sad But for whatever else I can say I can honestly say I am remorseless on this one I believe it falls into the category of fuck you very much hope you have a bad day,Scaring Teenagers,650

narelie,156,109,1qp37f,522,Due to my apparent obligation to tell this story Im doing my darndest to now deliver Its not delivery though its NarGiorno I had been scheduled to secret shop a nearby fast food chain location for the breakfast rush This is a popular time to check things because its a prime time for customers So I get started on my order this time Im doing a drivethru one I place the order and the girl is actuallyquite rude Doesnt offer a combo size upgrade this is HUGE for these guys doesnt ask what drink I want doesnt even tell me what my order total is She just immediately tells me to pull up to the next window Oh this is a lovely start Theres like three cars ahead of me so I sit back to wait and it takes a surprisingly long timeabout ten minutes For a breakfast rush this is bad  As a baseline youre supposed to have something like  seconds per car I get to the window and they just yanked my card out of my hand another ding theyre supposed to greet you and tell you your total again and tell me to pull up to the curb ahead and theyll bring my food out when its readyThis is a huge nono because it screws with the times recorded for their drivethru Theyre failing miserably and they know it so they start to do this to try and fake good timesMy order arrives another five minutes later bringing this all up toabout  minutes For a breakfast sandwich and Im not terribly surprised to find out its made completely wrongI park write down on the form what transpired record my times and head inside with them and my sandwich You see for this particular one I have to get manager signatures to confirm that I did in fact go there As I went inside I immediately just hear thispiercing laugh The dining rooms almost empty not surprised most hit the drivethrus so they can get to work asap and theres employees chasing each other around They spot me and one of them does a leaping slide across the counter and then grins at meI held up the forms and the grin justfellHe called the manager on over who was holed up in the back and she scowled and muttered as she read over the form Oh really OH REALLY REALLY Oh look at this Someone woke up this morning with a stick up her SAY WHATI inform her to sign the form now as I need to get back and she does then literally chucks my copy back in my face Forget the sandwich Im leavingI stalked out the door seriously angry at what happened and honestly annoyed at the fact that Im going to have to rake them over the coals for this Which I did I was straightforward on my report didnt embellish and I still got a call back from my rep asking if I was telling the truth I assured her it was all true She was shocked but admitted that this location tended to not have the greatest reports This one though took the cakeFast forward a month Im asked to shop the location again but this time dinner rushI get things started as normal did another drivethru this time was in a rush hehe and they did a bit better this time Still forgot to offer the combo upgrade but the drivethru girl was quite polite told me the total etc I drove up to pay and hooooly cow IT WAS THE BREAKFAST MANAGER Theyd apparently switched her shifts on me GAH She immediately recognized me and started squalling ITS HER Turning around she grabbed a poor teenage boy working the drink machine and yelled You handle her I cant do this right now Aaaaand then she up and left I could hear her freaking out as she walked all the way into the backThe poor boy was obviously super confused as to what was going on so I tried to be as nice as possible The shop went pretty well all in all so I went on ahead and filled out the report and headed inside to get the managers signature I was praying very very fervently that maybe Breakfast Manager was just working that night maybe she wasnt the manager on dutyNoooopeIt took them five minutes to convince her to come up front and then she started cursing at me and saying Id gotten them all in deep trouble Do you know that you got two people FIRED How do you sleep at night Lady Im sorry thats not really my fauOh sure SURE it isnt Stupid shoppers they always pick a itch to do them Well here you go hope youre freaking happy with yourself You got us all in trouble and now theyre crawling up our  because of youAt this point every single one of the employees turns and looks at me with huge eyes One guy pipes up Thatsthe shopper Thats why the DM came downYeaaaaah time to scramMade my second report and again rep called to see if I was making things up Nope it went well except for that psychopath of a manager My rep was floored and informed me apologetically that since Id been recognized so easily I could never secret shop that location again Honestly I was relieved at that Well its been a long time sinceand unfortunately psycho manager still works there I had a friend go in to check a few months ago and yep shes there Does she still hold a grudge Ha Said friends order was made wrong and he

rumplesplitskin,22,85,11g79o,525,We had a really lovely old woman who came in about twice a week to our petrol station Now she could not bend down to use the air pump to fill her tires so for the past few years when ive not been too busy with anything else i would go out and do this for her While filling her tires we got to chat and became quite friendly Note Im a six foot heavy set guy with a shaved head When she came in i would call her my purple granny As she like other pensioners died her hair that shade of purple that they seem to like and she would reply with at least she had hair She would even come into the shop and bring in treats for the staff but gave me extra like a granny would to her grandchildren All in all she was one of those rare customers that would brighten up even the most dull days A few months ago she told me she was moving down south to England to live with her son and this would be the last time we would see her but she promised to write to us to keep in touch Well true to her word she did write to use once a week sending up pictures of her with her son and grandchildren Then today a package came addressed to me personally and i did not recognize the handwriting but by the post code i knew where it came from My heart sank as i feared the worst It was from her son informing me that his mother passed on in her sleep last week He went on to thank me and the other staff for helping out his mother and more importantly being her friend He went on to tell me that she knew she was dying for the past year and talking to me in that time plus our weekly letters gave her something to take her mind off the situation Inside the package was a framed picture of her holding a air pump in a garage down there and written on it was the words its not the same without you baldie Well i burst out crying as i am just now typing this At the end of her sons letter was an open invitation to come down and visit with his family All i need to do is let him know and he will send me the train tickets I wrote to him as soon as i got home today so with luck in a few weeks i can go and pay my final respects to my purple haired grannyRIP Opurple one you will be missed,Sad day but heart warming too,610
ktarpey,152,103,1bfz1y,515,I work in a grocery store for the seafood counterA couple months ago I was working a closing shift when a couple of collegeaged guys came in asked me several questions about the king crab legs I was low on stock and told them that what I had out in my case was currently all I had left and that we should be getting another delivery in the next day They talked for a while and then asked me for five pounds I filled the order wished them a nice evening and sent them on their way The whole interaction took probably about  minutesTen minutes later my night supervisor stormed back with the bag of crab in hand and proceeded to slam it down on my counter in front of a few customers and tell me Next time you do something like this pointing at the crab legs you need to tell me firstI was actually speechless for a minute before I asked him Do what Sell crab legsHe tells me that the two guys had tried to walk out the door without paying for the crab legs about  and when he confronted them they actually tried to fight him over it At this point my face is bright red and I am being forced to ignore my customers to listen to this lecture I apologize to my manager and tell him that I didnt realize they would try to walk out with it Realize that the seafood counter is in the very back of the store and I cant even see the checkstands from it much less the doors He tells me that next time if you sell a lot of stuff like this to someone who looks like they cant afford it you need to tell a manager And then he walks awayI was almost in tears at this point and my customers that had been waiting just shook their heads and told me that they didnt know how I was supposed to know if someone could afford crab legs or notThere hasnt been an incident since although I do normally call ahead to the checkstands now if I sell lobsters so the checkers know theyre coming but I am still kind of in shock that Im supposed to be profiling customers and informing a manager if someone thats too poor to buy seafood is trying to do soDont know what to do What do you guys think,Im sorry you want me to what Not sure if management can ask me to do this or not,618
thedman,101,120,18m6xq,522,Lets start off with some contextI work for a membership based retail chain that has gas stations at some of our locations  any guesses yet The Gas stations are all pay at the pump no cash at all and there must always be an attendant at the station whenever it is open The main job of the attendant is to sit there and push a button that approves the pump for the member to fill up their vehicleOk now that we got that out of the wayA little while ago I was doing my shift at the gas station Normal day people coming and going no problem Then this guy calls me over because the card he was using was not working in the pump NO biggie this happens all the time sometimes they just need to flip the card around I go over to help and sure enough he is putting the card in wrong I explain as nicely as I can how to do it properly but while doing so I notice that its one of our MembershipCredit cards and the picture of the person on the card was of a women I looked into the car and saw no women I asked the man if he had another form of payment since I could not let him pay with another persons credit card because it is against the law He smiles and explains he has authorization to use it whatever that means I explain to him that our laws dictate that the person must be present to use the card and that I could not accept him paying with that card He gets a little angry and insists I just turn my back on him and let him fill up since he does not actually have to hand me the card he can just swipe it at the pump I explain that even if I did that for anyone and the card just so happened to be stolen the police would trace the card back to the last purchase find out it was here and use the security cameras to see who used it and see that I looked right at the card and continued to allow the purchase to go through Which would lead to my termination Something which I am not willing to risk for anyone He then blows his top and screams at me to go back to you little fuckin hut and shut up I am going to swipe this card and pay for this purchase and there is nothing you can do about it shit headI put on my calm smile and remind him that I have to click a button tha t approves his pump and no matter what I will not be pushing that button while he is using that card thats when it happened He turned to me came storming up to me and screamed in my face  you sir are the biggest ASSHOLE on the entire fucking planet Fuck you and your little fucking button I couldnt help myself at this point I just chuckled and said  seriously  on the entire planet that is quite the accomplishment Have a great day sir He got back in his car and peeled out of there A few other people who were filling up just looked at me and laughed So there you go folks I am the Biggest Asshole on the entire planet Do I get some kind of trophy nowTLDRGuy wanted to pay for gas with credit card that didnt belong to him I denied him and he knighted me the biggest asshole on the entire planet ,Bow down for I have been awarded the title of Biggest asshole on the entire planet,642

Aidernz,108,88,18mkzg,525,This is my second post in this very cool subredditAs explained in my first post I work in a produce department for a rather large supermarket chain in New Zealand and have for about  years I have many stories This little incident happened a few months agoSo I was filling the shop what we call it when we walk into the department in the shop find things that need filling eg bananas lettuce etc write it down on a list go out the back of the department put the items on a flat deck wheel it into the department and start filling the gaps As I was doing so I noticed a woman trying the grapes Now this isnt usually a problem but I sorta frown upon it I mean I dont mind if you try the grapes or any loose stock as long as its not an apple or watermelon or something Small loose stuff like grapes cherries lycheeshttpenwikipediaorgwikiLychee etc but it would be polite if people would ask us firstSo this particular woman was trying the grapes but she wasnt just trying one She had a whole handful An entire stem in fact About thishttpusrfcomwmnatikanatikanatikaperfectbunchofredgrapesisolatedonwhitebackgroundjpg many As she was doing her shopping in the department she had them in her hand by her side and would raise her hand to take one Basically she was trying to conceal the fact she had a handful She happened to walk passed me as I was filling the tomatoes We shall call her Grape LadyMe How do they tasteStunned look from Grape LadyRealizes I have seen her trying a handful of grapesGL Oh they are okMe Cool In future would it be ok if you want to try something to please ask and we are more than happy to let you sample the productGL Im just trying themMe I understand Normally we wouldnt say anything if you were just trying one but you have a whole handful GL Oh well fine thendrops the remaining grapes into my tomato crate on my flat deckwalks offI think she was a little embarrassed she was caught and didnt like the idea I challenged her Like I said Im happy for people to try ONE grape but not a handfulSo I continue with my flat deck and finish up with it I wheel it back into the back of the department and inform the others Im going to take my break It was lunch time so I went to the front of the store checkouts to grab a sandwich and a drink It was rather busy so there were a lot of people around As I was walking to the sandwich stand who should I see standing in line but Grape Lady I didnt notice her at first as I was walking passed the que she was standing in heading for the sandwiches when she piped up and said to meGL So what did you do to those grapes thenI stopped and turned around saw it was Grape Lady and answered her questionMe Oh Well I had to dispose of them I cant sell them unfortunatelyGL Pfft So what was the point of that then You could have just let me have them and they wouldnt be wastedMe Well like I said maam You are welcome to try one but we cant let you have a whole handfulGL Why not If youre just going to waste them whats even the pointMe Because its theft Thats why One grape is theft but its just one grape so we let it slide A handful of grapes is a different matter Please ask us if you want to sample something and Im happy to let you try one or two Not a handfulGrape Lady proceeds to place her basket of items on the ground and walk out of the store in utter disgustI watch as she walks away and heads for the exit I then start to find myself a checkout so I can purchase my lunch As I spot a small line in front of the VERY busy express lanes Grape Lady turns around and yellsGL IM GOING TO LAY AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU YOU DO NOT TALK TO CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT HOW DARE YOURight then EVERYONE stops and stares at me Customers in line checkout staff the MANAGER who was at checkouts helping with the rush at the time everyone I knew if I walked away from this every single person that heard her say that to me would instantly assume I was the rudest jerk in the store good ol public opinion aye I dont know what came over me but I spoke up and came out with thisMe Really and what are you gonna say Oh the man that caught me shop lifting was rude to me Yeah thats gonna look really good isnt it In fact the manager is standing RIGHT THERE pointing to him Why dont you tell himYou could hear a pin drop Everyone then looked at her Her jaw dropped her face went red I then saw what looked like tears probably out of pure frustration She then left the storeI heard one lady in line say to me Good on you and a group of students in the express lanes went awwwwkward in her direction It was awesomeOnce I purchased my lunch the managed asked if he could see me Went to his office told him exactly what I just wrote on here and he said ahh ok well I cant really say anything other than dont talk to customers in front of everyone like that but I know how it would have looked on you if you didnt So well doneMy heart was racing for a good min after that I never saw her againhmm I wonder if she browses Reddittldr Caught someone eating a large quantity of grapes She didnt like me informing her that its ok to try one but not a handful She threatened to lay a complaint and I told her she was shoplifting So go aheadedit spelling grammar and presentation,Customer tried to embarrass me in front of everyone at the counters until I informed her what she was doing was theft,613

WinnifredBurkle,77,101,17fp9t,517,Whoops I accidentally deleted my somewhat popular complainer mom and crazy yelling husband story Thanks though to all who readupvotedcommented I enjoyed itSo to make it up to you for deleting that post here is a new crazy person story Again this took place at the pizza placearcademaze area chain that I worked at through high school and college Anybody who is familiar with the place knows about exchanging tickets for prizes You may also be aware of how most places have whats called a ticket bank where kids can save up their winnings towards the giant stuffed toys or the cheapy skateboards or whatever We just kept a piece of card stock with the kids name birthday and ticket total in this filing cabinet Nothing super fancy So one day this mom comes in with a pretty small kid He was about two or so and was mostly interested in playing in the kiddie area but she was adamant that he come play games with her She spent hours playing this game called Wheel Em In where you try to get your token to land squarely on a number of lanes worth different amounts of tickets I dont know how to embed links but if you google it youll see what I meanAnyway she comes up to the counter close to closing Were helping a few straggling customers so she has to wait and I suggest she use the self ticket counter to get her ticket total She says no she doesnt trust that we didnt fix the machine to only count every second or third ticket She wants me to count this huge pile of tickets by hand I explain that that would probably result in more error as its really easy to lose your place but she insists I end up ripping all the tickets apart so that its a huge pile of unattached tickets and she has a total of around  Now  tickets can buy you a lot What it cannot buy however is a moderately sized stuffed version of our mascot Those were around  and this lady simply did not have enough That didnt stop her from pointing at it and telling me that it was what she wanted Im sorry maam you dont have enough for that Down in this case over here are the  ticket and under itemsNo I want that stuffed animal I have enoughNo maam Im sorry Those are  tickets You have So we argue for a little while then finally she seems to understand She looks at the  and under sections her little boy points at a few things he really seems to want but she doesnt decide on anything At this point were past our closing time everyone else is doing what closing duties they can and Im stuck with this lady Finally I say that I can put her tickets in a bank if she cant decide on a prize She looks at me like I told her to shove her tickets up my ass for safekeeping Absolutely not I dont trust you guys and those ticket banks You probably steal from them I give her a look like what the hell do you think Im going to use your tickets to steal from this place But instead I just smile and offer her a bag so she can take her tickets home NO I want that stuffed animal Ill just pay you the left over with cashNow I dont know if yall are aware but we cant do that Theres no tickettodollar ratio and we didnt have a code or anything to put into the register to show that we sold a ticket item for cash And besides if that was allowed we would run out of our bigger prizes really quickly and have to spend more money to get more  Im sorry maam but Im not allowed to take cash for prize items Id be happy to set you up a bank and youre more than welcome to take a picture so you know the total stays the sameLogic does not work on her She goes on a tirade about how fucking stupid it is that she cant purchase an item with cash especially when it was fucking obvious that her son wanted the stuffed animal way bad  Her son had been slumped against a wall exhausted with a finger up his nose for about twenty minutes He didnt give a damn about the toy Mom continued to argue I continued to tell her I just couldnt do it it would have cost me my job which I tried to explain and we went on and on Finally in a complete rage she just screamed a nonsense scream at me and pushed five hundred individual tickets off the counter Those bitches went everywhere She lets me know that she is never EVER coming back and I say Have a nice nightWe split the tickets and ate a shit ton of candy It was awesome And there you go Hope this makes up for deleting my other postIm sorry Ill keep posting about crazy ticket people and psycho party moms and crazy poop stories if you guys like Just let me knowEdit spelling,Accidentally deleted crazy parents post so heres a new story about a NEW crazy lady,618

DrunkenBlackBelt,79,130,16pkwo,516,Hello all I figure Id share a story before heading away for a week or two  Ive told it on here before but in comments so Ill tell it hereMighty Mouse Saves the Day Or Why I Quit Dudercrombie amp BitchSo obviously this was during my time with Dudercrombie amp Bitch  I was already growing sick and tired with the company their policies and the employees  Anyways as Im sure most of you are aware DampB hires based off looks  They get around HR issues by saying that they want to hire people who represent their brands and are outgoing fun and enjoyable to be around  But basically what they mean is young and extremely attractive  And if youre a minority to boot Fucking racial lottery jackpot as far as the company is concerned  Here is a typical managers meeting summed up for any of their storesManager  Guys we had to fire insert names here this week  So this means we are low on African Americans  Manager  Me and Manager  went recruiting to local event or popular hang out and found X amount of candidates  of them were African American and I got one Indian girlManager  Great Make sure you follow up with them so we can get them hired itll look good with our numbersNow this may seem like an exaggeration but believe me its not  Its bad enough to see people hired based off looks but given jobs especially managerial jobs just because of race is another issue More often than not the less attractive people were put into the back as Impact Team Basically stock  Not that these people were usually ugly by any means Just not Front Room Model materialNow I know some of you may be saying What does it matter As long as they are hard workers  And youre right  But a lot of times the models in the front room knew why they were hired and wouldnt care They were there to get paid and hang out  Some shined and really cared about their job and were great with customers Others just wanted to get paid and do as little work as possible Youll find that in any job but its exacerbated when the little shits know they were hired because they are attractive To make things worse it often left the Impact Team feeling like second class citizens  And a lot of times they were  They were usually left alone till something was needed or went wrong and thats when they had attention paid on them  This lead to a lot of issues with LP  I cant tell you how many interviews I had with someone I caught stealing where they basically said they only did it because the company doesnt care about them  It wasnt a good business model as far as Im concerned Then again what does that say about my looks if I was hired because Im supposed to NOT look like I work there Anyways I only added in that bit of background because it pertains to todays tale  I had been having issues with this company my managers and how they handled their shrink but this is why I ended up leaving the companyIt was Saturday Saturdays at this mall were busy  And I dont mean typical mall busy I mean busier than a all you can eat buffet with only one cook after Honey Boo Boos family walks in  I was bouncing around between stores typical observation spots and talking with other LP agents at other stores It had been slow on the LP end A sensor from a shirt found in the fitting room A bracelet tag found stuffed into the pants of some jeans Nothing huge Nothing worth worrying about missing  Thats why I got the call from my Follistar store  A manager there called and told me three hispanic guys had walked in opened a bag and swiped an entire table of colognes and bolted out I told her to call the police and get the tape pulled and to call two of the other stores I was going to go to the Dudercrombie and Bitch main store and wait   Luck was on my side when I walked in and saw the display in the front room was still up  Directly to the right of the door was a table full of polos and about  ft behind that were  tables one of which had some shirts and a cologne display  As I walked in two hispanic guys matching the description my manager had given me brushed passed me and walked over to the colognes  So I stay at the table with the polos and waved over the girl greeting in the front room She was new I hadnt met her before but I figured she could follow simple instructions  I made to act like I was asking her a question about the polo shirt I was holding but whispered to her to Run and go get the manager Tell her to call the cops here nowThe girl just stared at me like I had told her I do the Macarena with no pants on as a tribute to my fallen gang members  I was trying to discreetly instruct her while watching these two asshats  I told her again to go grab Managers name and call the cops now As I was talked to her I saw one of the guys pull out a booster bag from underneath his coat A booster bag is basically a bag that is designed to defeat store alarms I see Guy  open up the bag and Guy  just swipes all the colognes inside  Then for good measure he takes every shirt on the table and swipes them in too  Guy  then proceeds to walk toward the exitI hissed that the girl who was still standing next to me Go get her NOW  and moved in the way of Guy   Guy  sees me go to block his buddies path and books it  Fuck it I want the guy with the merchandise  Guy  stops for a second looks at me then the bag in his handNow when you make a LP stop youre supposed to identify yourself as working for the company and ask them to come along with you Youre often encouraged to refrain from discussing the theft in public Telling them youll talk about it back in your office  What I tried to say in this case wasMe Hi My name is DrunkenBlackBelt  I work for BampD Loss Prevention and Im going to need you to come with meWhat happened in this case was thisMe Hi my name is Drunkeand then Guy  swung the entire bag at my faceNope NOPE FUCK THAT  In the words of Ghandi  ITS GO TIME BITCH DIPLOMACY OVER  So guy swing bag at head and tries to run past me I grab bag grab guy with other hand  Now Im  and at the time   This guy turned out to be  and   So hes trying to kick me in the shins with his short stubby legs Im trying to stand back from being kicked with each hand of mine grabbing one of his wrist  Im sure it looked like a really awkward middle school slow dance just angrier The girl in the front room sees all this and FINALLY runs off  Good she finally understands who I am  Or so I thought  I throw Guy to the ground  Im attempting to put him on his back when some ass hat come running up and leading with his shoulder drives right into me  As he did so he yells GET OFF HIM HES DOING HIS JOB  Thank god that Guy  is a fat out of shape fucker cuz hes on the ground winded from our  second episode  I throw the guy who just tackled me off of me and yell Im the LP asshole  Im on my back at this point and Guy  start to get up and try to run Before he can eve take his second step I just kick out with my leg and catch his knee and Guy  goes down like a lesbian at a sleep over after a pillow fight  The guy who tackled me is trying to apologize while Im trying to get on top of Guy  again  Guy  is on his back kicking at me and I have his ankles trying to just wait to move them aside and get an arm secured  Meanwhile Douchbag McShoulders over here is waving in my face to get my attention because he wants me to know that hes REALLY sorry and feels bad he didnt know I wasnt the thief  Theres a huge crowd around us as this store was right by an entrance Suddenly the crowds part and I just hear  OUT OF MY WAY IM A MARRRIIIIIIINNNNEEEE as some guy comes outta knowhere jumps on top of Guy  and grabs his arms I tell Shoulders to get the fuck away from me in the nicest way possible of course and he melts into the crowd  Mighty Mouse the guy who jumped in says hes a Marine MP and helps me secure Guy   Eventually Mall security meanders over and I ask for their cuffs But they cant give them too me So I ask them to cuff him Nope They cant touch him unless he touches them first  I glare at him and debate letting Guy  up just so he can give this asshole a hard time but decided against it At this point Guy s shirt is gone hes sweating profusely and I am covered in it GrossAnyways we sit there for  minutes  Eventually I ask the mall security if he can call the cops  They show up  minutes later cuff Guy  and we go back to the office  They never got a call before I walk in the back and the girl I had been instructing is sitting with my manager I ask what the hell they are doing Manager says this girls trying to tell me something but that the girl doesnt speak english so manager doesnt know whatYup Girl was hired her first week in America because shes cute and black  Didnt speak any English Not that that should exclude her from working but maybe not in a job where you talk with customers and stop shoplifters all day   Processed Guy  Had just over  worth of shit in the bag  Got him for Assault and Possession of a Shoplifting tool too Had a talk with Manager and she  decided maybe this girl wasnt ready for the front room good fucking call  And the best part  Mighty Mouse had been at the jewlery store next to BampD buying an engagement ring I went over to thank him and the workers who knew me there they allowed me watch my store from their store gave him a  discount for helping out TLDR HHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY THAT MEANS THAT MIGHTY MOUSE IS ON THE WAY ,Tales From a Former LP Might Mouse Saves the Day,646

JacOfAllTrades,141,148,19fcoo,514,This was originally a comment that upon request I made into a postAt the time this totally blew my mind and it still does to this day As of Veterans Day  our company started offering military discounts I should say that we officially started offering them for if someone asked for one wed just give them a  discount using a different code and as such we started getting a lot more military in the store Well that means we get disabled vets who get military discount and tax exempt so they save  and no tax I had an older couple do this and the woman behind them lost her fucking mind She just started screaming So they get  off because why For nothing Whatd you do that was so special Not a damn thing Im a teacher and I dont get shit Fuck youHeres some things to note before I say the response  this guy clearly had a prosthetic leg the metal pole kind massive facial scars and three missing fingers  to do a tax exempt sale we have to enter information into the computer then make a physical copy of the document which takes time and is obvious  to get a military discount I take the ID and hold it up to match the picture so again obvious  I will try to give you a discount if youre polite regardless and finally  no way in hell a teacher can afford to shop at buy what she was buying at my store unless there is some other source of income so shes clearly either full of shit or reliant on someone elseThe response Maam without this mans service you wouldnt be able to say things like that without being shot where you stand The vet just shook his head but his wife laughed The lovely and eloquent teacher put her stuff on the counter and demanded a discount and when I told her no she demanded a manager Who also refused the discount and once she was told the whole story told the woman not to come back until she learns some respectAs an aside I get really pissed off when people try to use military IDs that arent their own,How to never ever get a discount ever,662
flarpy,31,113,1oz9nd,511,This previous summer I started a new job as an ice cream man My job consisted of driving my converted school bus around town and peddling my wares to anyone who would buy One of my favorite areas to drive through was this dingy little back road that housed some of the strangest people I ever interacted with The first odd experience happened right around my second week on the job By this time I had become pretty familiar with my route and was now focused on building relationships with my customers I remember encountering this one kid who shall be referred to as Kingpin in this story Now Kingpin was this adorably small blonde haired boy who was probably around  years old The couple of previous times he had bought from me I could barely hear him order so I naturally assumed he was just a meek mannered boy This day however turned out to be quite different As I pulled up to Kingpins house I could see  older kids wrestling in the front yard The all had Kingpins blonde hair but were much larger and seemingly more aggressive than him So Kingpin comes strolling out of the house bypasses the violent tussle in the yard and comes straight up to my truck Are those your brothers I asked attempting to foster some relationships and all that jazz Yep Three ice cream sandwiches he replied without giving a glance to the MMA exhibition happening behind himI figured he was just being a nice brother and buying ice cream for his siblings but I was surprised when he unwrapped one of the sandwiches and began eating it feverishly Now my boss trusted me to give out ice cream when it would help build a relationship with a customer so I figured that Kingpin just didnt have enough money to buy one for all three As he began to walk away I called out to himHey Take an extra one so all your brothers can have one I said feeling confident that I was doing my good deed for the dayImagine my surprise when Kingpin unwrapped a second ice cream sandwich and began to demolish it despite the fact that he hadnt finished the previous one No I got one for them which was spoken with the biggest smirk on his face Then he leaned in close to me and delivered the line that quickly cemented his place in my Hall of Favorite Customers Im gonna make em fight like dogs And then Kingpin walked away into legend,The Ice Cream Truck Tales PT ,624
MackaySmith,128,113,1metwl,511,To start things off I want to give a little back story I work at an officeelectronics store A couple weeks ago a something year old girl comes in with her friend Ive worked years in retail so I honestly dont profile based on color but there are some things that put up an instant red flag This girl and her friend both reeked of marijuana They looked around for a bit asked about some tablets and then decided to buy a bunch of gift cards  worth I didnt notice because once they were done asking about the tablets I walked away and they dealt with the cashier Their cards didnt swipe but their IDs checked out so she punched in the numbers and it worked She realized later that it was a scam and told the manager Anyways after all this happened about two nights ago another girl dressed similarly to the other two walks in No big deal lots of people dress that way I noticed her looking at my shirt a bunch then avoiding meI am not a manager but I have a different shirt color than most other employees She must have thought me a manager Next thing I know one of the cashiers asks me to help her buy a laptop So I ask her which one she would like and she tells me I want this laptop and these two tabletsRed flagI have to get a manager to let me into the back to get the things she requested While we are there I tell my manager Mike this lady just asked for an expensive laptop and two tablets like it was nothing She didnt ask anything about them He responds You think somethings up Definitely We go back outside and I bring the items up to the cashier The girl brings up about  worth of gift cards she wants to buy My manager and I stand close by watching over the new cashier When its almost finished and we require payment wouldnt you know it her card isnt recognized by our machine She swipes again Doesnt work Again and again My manager checks her ID and it seems to be correct But because we know this is fraud we tell her to contact her bank and that we cant sell her anything She leaves and my manager goes and emails all our other stores in the city warning them about this girl He then calls our store manager who was at the time helping another store He explains what just happened and we get praised for catching her Once they are off the phone the girl walks into the other store Now my store manager LOVES catching people stealing He lets her go and pick out all the things she wants and then bring it up to the register Before even ringing up her items though he says Hmmm they couldnt help you at the other store Her eyes widened They called you to which my manager responds What Nope She immediately walks away and flips off my store manager on the way out It felt so good stopping her ,Caught someone trying to use a fake credit card,624

jailhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbagdyellingatthewrongguyorhowabitchyladyAnother day another  gallons of fuel to sell  Let it be known to all and sundry that despite the events that I have told here most of my days at the station were in fact rather dull  Car comes in say hi take money pump gas hand back receipt say bye  Over and over and over again ad infinitum  It was a job that allowed one to either A turn your brain off and not think or B let your mind wander and think about awesome creative stuff like unicorn hair care products or specialty underwear for overweight leprechauns  Or maybe the gas fumes were getting to meIt was also in a rather rich neighborhood  Rare exotic or otherwise extremely expensive cars were a common occurrence  Lamborghinis Ferraris Maseratis Bentleys Rolls Royces Aston Martins etc  So when a very nice Porsche Carrera GT rolled into the station I was not overly amazed  I walked over and greeted the driver as I always do with a cheery smile  He stepped out of the vehicle handed me a card and asked me to fill up with supreme  No problem  He then stepped over into the parking lot and lit up a cigarette far enough away that I didnt have to yell at himIt wasnt busy at that moment so I stuck by the car as it slowly filled and my eyes wandered over to the driver  He was dressed nicely a suit that I could tell was probably worth more than all my guitars put together  Hair slicked back  Shoes probably worth more than my shitty car  And a crack pipe in his handDouble takeWas I seeing that right  I looked closer and yeah there in his off hand a small glass pipe with charring on one end and what looked like cotton in the other  Huhn never seen one of those outside of class  I walked over to my assistant manager who was part of the same criminal justice college classes I was and surreptitiously told him about it  He walked over doing his best to look inconspicuous and had a gander himself  Yup sure looks like a crack pipe  WeirdWe had a quick debate as to whether we should call the police but were leaning towards not  We werent  certain though it really looked like one  And its JUST the pipe hes not smoking it nor does he have any baggies of something yellowish and clumpy  Probably should just let this one goBut our minds got made up for us when a State Trooper pulls in  Complete coincidence the trooper needs gas  Okay since hes already hereI go over do the greeting again  By the way sir Im not  certain of this but it really looks like the guy over on pump  has a crack pipe in his hand  Could you go take a lookIts a young cop  Maybe   And he gets that Oh ho I have just stumbled upon criminal activity I shall investigate forthwith look on his face that gungho new cops can get and steps out of his vehicle  The driver of the Porsche has now walked back over to his car as the pump has clicked off and hes waiting to be disconnected so he can leave  I dont know if he even saw the copWhat I do know is that when the cop walked around the pillar that holds up our awning he didnt even get a single word out of his mouth  Because the Porsche driver immediately swung on him  BAD IDEA  The cop was freshly off FTEP all that handtohand training he got in academy fresh in his mind  That one swing was all the suspect got because he was immediately dumped on the ground and pinned down while the cop yelled into his radio for back up  My manager and I stood in shock jaws somewhere down around our kneecapsWhat had been just one State Trooper getting gas was now one State Trooper conducting an arrest with two local cops a county sheriff and a State Trooper supervisor observing and acting as backup  My manager another attendant who hadnt been involved at all up to this point and myself figured it would be a good idea to back off and let the cops do their thing  Customers werent going to be pulling up anyway not with a bunch of red and blue lights flashing everywhere  I also suggested making popcorn but got vetoed  Always gotta ruin the funSo the suspect is now being interviewed and a search of his car is being conducted  Suddenly everything just seems to stop and the cop who was hipdeep in the car slowly backs out with a very large bag  Think a quart freezer bag thats been filled with air so its the shape of a pillow  And inside is a black semiliquid substance  Ya know kinda looks like heroin  Someone grab a test kitYup  Heroin  Two and a half pounds of itNow several more units show up all of them saying supervisor or lieutenant on the doors  The suspect is no longer being an idiot and trying to swing at anyone but he is VERY vocal about how he needs to be released  He has a job interview to get to and he REALLY needs to go  Over and over and over again like a broken record of the album Interview Nervousness by the band Career Hunter  Sorry bro thats really not going to get you out of this one  He was arrested the car was towed away and we basically didnt do any business for about  minutes  And I never got any popcornTLDR  Would leprechauns buy whiskeyflavored edible underwearEDIT  Seriously I can spell reallyEDIT   I can copypaste links too,Can I go now I have a job interview to get to or you shouldnt have that kind of stuff in your car,651

dmac,54,154,1g5tfz,505,At the time of this story I am working as a cashier and hating my life This isnt because of how monotonous the job was It was mostly because of the ludicrous behavior of our affluent guests The area I worked in was right on the border of two towns one being very wealthy and the other being very poor This meant that we had a mix of income levels in our store but the worst were the ones from the rich townSo this night had been a pretty good one up until this point Most of my guests had small purchases and it wasnt too busy so I engaged in some small talk with many of them talking about how I was leaving for university soon and them wishing me good luck Everything was going smoothly Right then Charmander Ill call her this due to her fiery personality walked up to my register with an obscene amount of clothing which is strange because usually pokemon dont wear clothes but I ring up her up I look at the clothes give an internal sigh and go to work taking the clothing off the hangers folding them up and bagging them nicely for her Also I should mention that she is staring down my computer the whole time like a falcon about to go in for the kill making sure that every single item is priced correctlyApparently one of the items had rung up incorrectly and she told me that it was supposed to be  I looked at the price which happened to be around  this was a very nice dress and thought there was no way it was  I politely told her I would call someone in softlines and they could check for us This set off Charmander and she evolved straight into a Charmeleon right in front of my eyesCharmeleon claimed that she also worked retail and she knew that I could manually change the price This was true but I could only do it in situations where the price was under  and the price quoted to me looked to be about right She also claimed that the customer is always right so I shouldnt be wasting her time checking the price I got a call back from the department the dress was from and they told me that it was in fact  I thanked them and repeated this to Charmeleon hoping that this would end the argument Not even close Now she is a fullfledged Charizard breathing flames into my face She yells at me with I work in retail and I KNOW that you can changed the price I told you that the price was  so you so change it for me You are so imcompetentAll of a sudden a Blastoise and her trainer appeared to put out the flames This Blastoise attacks Charizard with a Hydro Cannon by saying If you actually worked retail you wouldnt be yelling at this cashier right now Hes just doing his job so when he tells you he cant change the price that means he cant So either you can pay for your stuff and fuck off or we can meet outside and I can fuck you up Your choiceAt this our Charizard has quieted down and has decided to pay for her items and leave the store without another word As she leaves the trainer yells out at the top of her lungs Have a good day motherfucker which causes Charizard to fly out of the store as fast as possible All I could do after this exchange was laugh and thank her over and over again I also gave them some discounts on a few of her items because they were so awesome They told me that they both work retail to and hated seeing bitchy customers in other stores so they always told them off I couldnt stop smiling the rest of the nightEdit Fixed some grammatical issues and wording,Clearly I cant change the price of your dress,659

stillalurker,64,112,1p24c1,503,So a couple people asked for more about the manager at the orange home improvement store well here you goFor those that didnt see the last post I work as an order picker for deliveries and will call Basically you order something Im the lucky guy that gets to find it in the store put it on a pallet and then shove it on a truck So a customer went through management to place an order for about  linear feet of molding they normally come in  foot lengths Apparently after talking to this manager she created the order and pulled it herself But she didnt put the order to the dispatch so our delivery trucks dont know they have an order to deliver She didnt put a location as to where she left the order And she didnt put a purple tag on it to say that it was for deliverieswill callSo going through the store picking the order we are only able to get about half of the molding Great So I call the customer to see if they want to wait or if we want to try to get it from another store She assures me that we have enough and to talk to my manager So I dial  manager picks up and I explain the situation She quickly snaps back at me that the order is by the managers office on a cart This was surprising because when you complete an order you put a tag on it and you put it by the door that we load the trucks out of not the managers office So whatever I go pick it upOnce there she tells me that she told me about this yesterday and that Im wasting time I paused and reminded her that I dont work on Tuesdays that you must have told someone else She said that she knew she told me So I go and print out my punch times for the last week and none were made on Tuesday I shove it on her desk and kindly tell her to let us handle deliveries because it wastes her time She looks a little embarrassedSo we get the order and are all set too put it on the truck But the driver says that he doesnt have room for it and that its not in the dispatch route he has Well fuck me Nothing we can do about it hes right So we call the customer and inform them that we have the material but that we cant deliver it today Lady flips a shit and asks to speak with managementCouple minutes later I get a call from this bitch of a manager And she is screaming at me for not delivering it Then I explained how it wasnt in the dispatch and the driver didnt have room so he couldnt have taken it Here comes the face palm moment She asked what the dispatch is Ohhhh boy She had no clue that you need to let the fucking delivery truck service know that you have an order or orders to pick up So I end up walking down to her office again to show her what she didnt do And I told her that she can call the customer back and tell them why we cant deliver it And I stood there and watched her sheepishly explain how she didnt know what she was doing to the customerMoral of the story managers have no clue on the daytoday operations of store employees And things only take longer when they get involved,Your manager told me you guys have enough of it,615

DrunkenBlackBelt,80,206,15uaa0,502,Happy New Year to all of you from TFR that follow the Gregorian calender Hope your New Years Eve was plentiful and your hangover didnt last two long  I have a short one today Short especially by my standards of writing  So todays story we harken back to the days of old December  for todays adventureA Tale of Two IdiotsIt was the best of times it was the worst of times  Bushs time in office was numbered  America was hopeful that some black dude from Chicago could be black and therefore cooler than our white semi retarded president from Texas  The Olympics that year were already a faded memory except for that one guy who won like  medals for swimming and smoked pot USA USA USA  A man was impregnated  Beyonce was advising men across the nation that if you like it then you should indeed put a ring on it  The terrible scourge that we now know as Beiber Fever was in the future and we were all blissfully unaware of how it would come and sweep the nationOh and there was this financial crisis thing you may have heard about Probably not It was WOEFULLY under reported in the media  Its only our stock market collapsing after all  Stories about a guy who used to be a woman getting pregnant are much more interesting and important because AmericaAnyways I was working LP at a Blue and Yellow shirted electronic retailer  The month before our red shirted enemies at Circuit City had declared bankruptcy and closed down Huzzah Just proving once again in the long standing battle of Red Vs Blue that Red sucks and Blue will always triumph Even if we have a teamkiller named Caboose on our side  Anyways its holiday season busy time for all Especially busy as our main rival in retail was no longer here So we were seeing a lot of new customers Management was happy the company was ecstatic because apparently they had never heard of this little site Amazoncom If you havent either I suggest checking them out Its a gamble being as they are so small but its definitely worth itAnyways Im working at my podium searching cameras looking like Big Bird in my Khaki pants and Bright Yellow polo  Like a sexy sexy Big Bird of Justice  When off at customer service I hear a commotion  What is this  Danger afoot DRUNKENBLACKBELT AWAYI had my co worker watch the cameras and doors while I walked over to see who was yelling and cursing up in my store and why  I see a middle aged man red faced yelling at an associate who was as equally red faced out of frustration  Now this co worker was a nice enough guy Showed up for each shift on time did his work was pleasant to talk to He just wasnt smart  I mean this kid was so dumb he was about as sharp as a marble  Believe me when I tell you this kid was so dumb that he thought that OJ really was innocent  If you showed him how to do something gave him a little hands on experience he got it and was fine But if anything deviated from that training he was about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipopSo I naturally assumed he was trying to do something he wasnt sure about and too shy to ask for help  Getting berated by this poor customer wasnt helping and I could see this co worker TJ looking like he just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear As I walked over the man stopped yelling mid rant and stared at me Angry Man Are you a manager  Can you help me with this idiotNow he still had anger spittle dangling from his lips as he said this  Meanwhile TJ was staring at me pleading with his eyes for me to save him  Well I may not have been the LP that store deserved but I was the LP that store neededMe Sir I work LP but Ill try to assist the best I canAM Well I want to return this item its defective But your employee here cant seem to find it in the system  I understand you are all kids and older fuck ups who cant get a real job here but how hard can it beMe  Sir Ill do what I can to assist  However Im gonna need you to stop yelling and not talk to us like that if you want help  OK  AM Whatever long as you can actually do something or find me someone who canAM Ok whats going on TJTJ I scan it and its not showing up Neither the receipt or the product itself  I cant figure it outNow I want to be a cop  I eventually would like to work as a detective Ive always enjoyed a good mystery and like to think I have an eye for detail  So any sort of mystery to be solved is right up my alley  But looking at the situation in front of me all I wanted to do was punch TJ in the face and then follow it up with a swift kick to the balls of the customer to make sure he can never reproduce idiot spawn  For you see the packaging for the item in question was a brand that was owned and sold exclusively at Circuit City And next to the product itself was a receipt with the words CIRCUIT CITY clearly printed on the top of itA long moment passed  Maybe this was a prank  Am I being Punkd as it were  Asthon Kutcher you son of a bitch Youve made a fool of me for the last time  Alas it wasnt a prank just two brain dead human beings One with his head in the clouds another with his head so far up his ass that hed have to cut his own nipples off just to seeMe Well it seems the issue is that this product wasnt purchased at Rest Ruy  AM What Me Well Sir and TJ you can both clearly this receipt says Circuit City at the top  Also this item was made for and sold exclusively at Circuit City  So thats probably the issueTJ at this point looked like he was going to die of embarrassment  I felt bad he was a loveable goof  Angry Man looks at TJ and with a voice of superiority says And you couldnt figure that out You had to have someone help youI honestly felt like my brain was going to pop  I thought after hearing something so stupid Id just go insane be relegated to a hospital for the rest of life to chase butterflies and drool into my supper every night Luckily my mind is strong and my mental fortitude allowed me go onMe Sir might I point out that you were the one who brought this here   AM Well yeaMeAM YOUR POINTMe My point is that youre calling him an idiot for not recognizing that its a competitors item yet you didnt realize the same thingAM I KNEW But I brought it here to return itMe Yea But its a competitors itemAM Yea a competitor who is closed nowMe YesAM Good so you see my pointAt this point  I felt certain my children would be born with the intelligence of a snail with down syndrome just from conversing with this man  I had no idea what he was getting atMe Im sorry but it seems like you are saying the same things I am but youre arriving at a different conclusion So could you explain to me what exactly you think was going to happen when you returned this and whyAM  Jesus christ  Circuit City is closed  I cant return my items there anymore  You guys are still open So you can do their returnsMe No No we cant  They are a competitor  Even when they were open we couldnt return items from them I dont know why them closing would change anythingAM Well why wouldnt you Youll get the money they lostMe No You spent money there and got a product  Then if you returned it here wed have no way to process the return Even if we could we would be giving you a product from our stock So wed lose money on that productAM Listen just because you work retail doesnt mean you know how business worksMe Oooooook  Yea listen this is getting nowhere  You cant return it here  Simple as that We dont want to do it and even if we did there is no way to do it as we cant accept this item into our stock or give you the same exact item  FollowAM Get your manager I sent TJ to find a manager  If this guy was left alone with TJ Im sure hed continue to berate him  I just sat and stared while the guy mumbled under his breath and glared at me  Luckily it was Manny our cool manager on at the time Manny was my direct manager and a great guy Old school Italian guy who was easy to get along with took care of his employees and knew the businessManny walks over and I explain the situation  Manny looked at me and asked AM if this was some sort of prank AM scoffed and got angry saying how no one here knew what the fuck they were doing and this is why he never shopped here He just didnt have a choice now because Circuit City was closed Manny just laughed and said that if he was indicative of the customers that Circuit City catered too no wonder they went out of business  AM got angry and said You just lost a big customer  Naturally Manny just laughed and said You never shopped here How did we lose you if you werent a customerAM stomped out hooting and hollering the whole time about what a bunch of idiots we were I walked him out letting him rant and laughing and smiling the whole time  TJ thanked me and apologized  We had a laugh and he bought me a Red Robin burger and fries for lunch to thank meTLDR It was the best of times it was the BLURST OF TIMES You stupid monkey Caboose ,Tales From a Former LP and Masterpiece

rossildosil,109,153,1pdp45,501,I work in a Large hardware store One time when I was out in the garden centre watering the plants this guy comes through the doors screaming his head off my manager calmly walks in behind him It turns out he saw some Lillys on the clearance section and decided that because they were reduced from  to  that the ones NOT in the clearance section should be the same priceThey get over to the Lillys and then the guy goes mental about how the same product shouldnt be different prices my manager calmly explains that its because the Lillys he saw in clearance had already bloomed hence them being reduced The argument went on and on with the guy hurling abuse at my manager for about  minutes meanwhile a small crowd had gathered next to me as I was hiding in the bamboo watching this all unfold at this point my manger lost it and began shouting back at him Telling him to get out the store and not to come back The angry gentleman then proceeded to knock plants over and kick the trolleys as he went towards the exit he did the same when he was in the actual store knocking over tins of paint on the ends of the aisles It took about  hours to clean up his rampage and we had to write off about  worth of stock due to the about of paint he knocked over and damaged other stuff on his way Edit not sure if the police were called or not I presume not I dont work there anymore but if Im in Ill ask,Argument over  causes  worth of stockloss,654

legomaniac,36,106,1hafen,501,So in my  years at the same pet supplygarden center store Ive seen a lot of employees come and go My bosses are notorious for being horrible judges of character when hiring and are known for hiring people that turn into veritable nightmares So I thought Id share a few of the more memorable ones over the past few yearsBefore I continue it should be noted that my store is a small family owned business My managers are the coowners of the store and they make all of the hiring decisions and whatnot They are notably lenient when it comes to enforcing store policy and honestly youve gotta try pretty hard to get fired from this place We have a lot more freedom than what you would have in a typical retail chain Right enough of the boring stuff Onward The first notably bad employee they hired was a kid of about  years old well call him Creeper Kid CK had a very thin peach fuzz prepubescent mustache that made him look like a young porno film director and had a creepy smile that made him look like he was visualizing you without clothes He also didnt have a single shred of common sense Bad enough as it is but it gets worse   CK was incredibly lazy He was hired primarily to work with me in stocking shelves and carrying heavy things out to customers cars Normally hed clock in put two bags of dog food on the shelves and plop down in the back and play on his phone Now occasionally the stock boys would play the not it or the nose goes game when it came to carryouts and every once in a while it was fine But CK took advantage of this and every time he heard the intercom beep before the page even started hed yell out not it and refused to do anything that involved him moving   The last straw was when he came into work all excited that he had just bought a new blade for his box cutter He decided to demonstrate for me just how sharp this blade was by slicing off the top of what else but an empty oz soda bottle He was right the blade was quite sharp and it did a great job slashing a  gash in the side of his hand He was rushed to the hospital for stitches came back the next day and tried to claim workers compensation for an injury while on the job lying about how he had cut himself I had already told my managers what had actually happened and his claim was denied He was fired shortly after Total time of employment  months The next gem of an employee comes from the pet department After CK got fired I had migrated from stocking shelves to working in the pet dpt  This is where Big Fat Fuck comes in He was about  tall and almost as wide and always had a Mountain Dew in his hand BFF was hired for one thing and one thing only to clean animal cages The one thing he never did was clean animal cages He would waddle up to the display cages in the middle of the animal room flop his Pillsbury Doughboy belly up on the cages and start bitching about how hard he worked and how he deserved a raise and how he just wanted to go home and play GTA   BFFs downfall came on a Saturday morning He had been told by my boss to get the mouse cages cleaned Thusday and again on Friday when he didnt get them done the day before BFF was already on thin ice with my managers and I had been explicitly told to NOT clean any cages as BFF was supposed to get them done Saturday rolls around and these cages still hadnt been cleaned BFF dicked around all morning until lunch time he clocks out and as he lumbers by the animal room he lets loose the single sentence that to this day still makes my blood boil   Hey legomaniac ltmanagergt told me to tell you that you need to clean those mouse cages before I get back from lunch   I stood there in absolute shock for a moment as the rage built up inside of me I was more pissed than I think I have ever been and I am not an angry person I am very easy going and youd have to try really hard to get me pissed off enough where I just rage uncontrollably But BFF did it I stormed up to my manager on duty explained eg shouted to him what happened and that either BFF goes or I do He was fired that evening Total time of employment  month Next in the lineup is Desperate Creeper Chick DCC was in her mids bisexual and about a  in the looks department Thinking back on it she could have been a reallife version of Lumpy Space Princess She would repeatedly ask every employee moderately close to her age range myself included if they wanted to come over to her house for a sleepover After being shut down over and over by everyone in the store she started asking any customers that she found remotely attractive the same thing Needless to say this didnt go over so well with people and when the awkward I think your employee is hitting on me complaints began to roll in DCC was canned Total time of employment  weeksWell that got a lot longer than I had thought FFS OP STFU already Ok ok fine I have several more stories about failed coworkers Ill share in a Part II Bipolar racist douchenozzles and psychopathic animal hoarders coming soon to a subreddit near you,Coworkers from hell Pt I,607

CurvedStraightLine,34,92,1h7q7e,501,Continuing on with my stories from my old jobWe had a customer I will call Eleanor due to her resemblance to Eleanor Roosevelt  She had a constant look on her face of vague confusion as though she was just planted on this Earth and hadnt figured out the customs  Eleanor was considered one of our top customersin our store it meant she spent over  on average a monthEleanors preferred method of shopping was to come in walk to the back of the store plant herself on one of the couches and demand employees bring her certain clothes  Shed literally wave down the closest employee and demand Bring me a skirt  Something colorful  or Bring me a jacketNormally this wasnt too much of an issue but she refused to schedule secret shop times so having one employee dedicated to just her was occasionally difficult  On one particularly busy day when I had a few call offs I knelt down beside her and quietly said Im really sorry Eleanor but I dont have the staff to bring you clothes todayShe stared at me bewildered  Then how do I shop  She literally couldnt consider that she could walk around the store and select her own clothingWe also had issues with her mistaking other customers for employees and suddenly some woman shopping would feel someone grab their skirt and demand that they bring Eleanor pantsEleanor was constantly planning trips  We kept dossiers on our best customers and hers read like an adventure novel  Cruises through the Keys  Trips to the Caribbean  Italy for the fall  A time share in Cape Cod  Each with a new set of mix and match clothes for her to wear Shed brag that her husband was an executive in a locally based large business Shed name drop the local elite  I had plenty of customers who did that it wasnt a big thing  Wed all just nod and take her moneyEleanor would veto clothes for ridiculous reasons  Those flowers are too flowery shed say to a skirt  But we quickly found that if you took something away then brought it back a moment later shed love it the second timeOne day Eleanor asked for a skirt  She had me hold it in front of her staring at it intensely then suddenly shut her eyes and looked away for a moment  Then she stared at it intensely then closed her eyes  Then told me to take it away and bring another We went through this look then look away routine with a few different garments before I finally just asked what she was doingHer sister in law it seems just redecorated her living room  She was going there for dinner and planned to sit on the sofa  For this she wanted to make sure she coordinated with the new interior decoratingThat little episode started a new stage in Eleanors shopping  She would still demand clothes but when she tried them on shed prance through the fitting suite alternating between looking at her own reflection and closing her eyes in lets pretend  Can you picture me wearing this on the sands of Aruba shed ask  Wed all agree it was Aruba sands appropriateOne day she was looking for something that was good for Italy  We had some marketing from the previous fall laying around that was Tuscany themed and I held it up behind her as backdrop  She loved itThen came the day that we got a new employee in  She went to Eleanors church  Im sure everyone in retail has had a moment where someone hasnt recognized you out of context  This was one of those moments  Eleanor is sitting there letting this woman bring her things running her mouth about the fabulous places shes going and who she knows  Finally my employee just goes Now Eleanor  You know none of that is trueTheres a stunned silence  Eleanors eyes go wide  She tries on her things quietly then leaves quietlyWe find out from my employee Eleanor was the much younger wife of a man she had known for years  Yes he used to work for the company she mentioned but not nearly as high ranking as she claimed  Plus hed been retired for years  The vacations  Pretty much all not trueEleanor though wasnt the smartest of women and she came back in  If the employee who knew her wasnt there shed spin her stories  If she was shed buy one or two things quietlyThen one day Eleanors husband came in  He was elderly and pissed  Turns out that Eleanor had been maxing out credit cards she was taking out without his knowledge  He had two huge bags of clothes to return things from months ago tags still in place  All bought to support her personal fantasy world  Her husband wanted us to deny her service from that day on  We couldnt do that so he just started going with her when she shopped  Hed demand she get up to do her own shopping and she would get one maybe two items per visitBut when you were alone with her back in the fitting suite shed still whisper that her husband doesnt want us to know shes wearing this or that to the governors mansion this weekend  Wed nod and act amazed  It was just sadEleanor quietly dropped off of our best customers list,Eleanor NONE of that is true,593

piperpiping,52,90,1isfgc,500,Another post here reminded me of this tale  It took place years ago when I was in high school and working as a cashiercart jockey in a supermarketOne day I come in and our assistant manager is really pissed  Earlier in the day this one cashier Dave let a guy leave with  ish in groceries without paying  Dave was also in high school like me but was a really naive guy  I think hed been homeschooled until high school and was incredibly trusting  Some guy came in went grocery shopping and didnt have his wallet  Dave let him leave with the groceries because the guy left his shoes there and said hed be back with money in two hours  Dave being super trusting thought this was fair and let the guy leaveUnderstandably the assistant manager was mad at Dave and sent him home  She told him that he was fired unless this guy showed up for his shoes with money  The shoes in question were pretty wellworn sneakers they werent worth anything  About an hour into my shift this guy shows up asking about his shoes and waving his wallet around  He actually came back paid for the groceries thanked the store profusely and left with his shoes  Dave got to keep his job because the assistant manager kept her wordDave comes in the next day and everyone is teasing him for being stupid  He goes Im not stupid like I said that guy came back and paid  Our Store Manager who had heard the whole story just looks him dead in the eyes and says Youre still an idiot Dave,Youre still an idiot Dave,590

lolingroflcopter,37,61,1eexfx,497,I work in a large pet retail store that has generally one or MAYBE two cashiers up at the register at a time who are also in charge of answering and directing all of the phone calls we get Because were often busy ringing people up the phone calls can be a little tricky Here was an interesting experience I went throughI was stocking products by the front of the store while a coworker of mine was working the register on a very busy day with the phones constantly ringing I tried to help her out whenever I could but the products needed to get out on the floor ASAP At one point she gets a call from a woman asking her to check to see if a product is in stock My coworker tells her she needs to put her on hold for one minute to connect her to stock so they can check on the product The woman gets angry loudly enough that I can hear it on a busy day while stocking the shelves telling my coworker she should go check the product herself My coworker tries to explain that she is both answering phones and ringing up customers on register and she cannot leave the register I can hear that it is a stock call so I come up to answer the call about thirty seconds after the woman has been put on hold I answer the call and ask how I can help her She then tells me she has a question for the fish department This is not at all what she told my coworker and I can do stock but know nothing about fish fish questions need to be directed to our fish specialist I tell the woman I need to put her on hold again to connect her to the fish departmentAt this point she gets ANGRY She starts yelling at me telling me that she CANNOT be put on hold again as she has been on hold for the last TWENTY MINUTES and reconnected SIX TIMES I absolutely MUST answer her question now because it is my jobI wait for her to finish and calmly tell her I am not a fish specialist and cannot help her Furthermore Ive been standing by the register since she first called the store a full minute and a half ago Therefore she should probably stop wasting our time by saying things that arent true and Id be happy to connect  her to fishShe stammered and hung up reeeeal fast I may have lost that customer but it was still a sweet sweet feeling to catch her in her bullshit,The beautiful satisfaction of catching a customer in a lie,558

mkepro,48,86,1br122,497,Six and a half years ago I worked for a computer corporation that was in the early stages of their retail store venture I could point to any of a dozen reasons for why I left My father and I went into business together the store manager had selfconfidence issues and took it out on anyone taller than his  self poor scheduling the practice of patting us down where customers could see because someone was stealing from Back of House all good reasons But let me tell you about the day that made me decide that I can no longer be in the business of retailoriented customer serviceThree nights before Christmas after working a closing shift I got a call from a coworker who offered to trade me his opening shift for my closing shift so he could go to the doctor I agreed because I always like to do a friend a favor As it turned out the antacids he was taking werent helping his stomach pains because he needed emergency surgery to remove his appendixMy manager joy that he was told me that since I traded shifts and my coworker couldnt show up now I had to take my original shift too I didnt blame my coworker but I think the manager could have at least attempted to bring someone else in for that closing shiftSo the night drags on Most of my work is fairly mundane Replace an mp player help a customer pick a replacement battery format an external hard drive etc But Im dragging Im starting to make little mistakes after completing  of my  hours of work over the course of that two daysFinally the end of the night approaches But  minutes before the doors are set to close everyone suddenly remembered that its December  and they all decided that little Timmy would hate them forever if he didnt have the latest MP player or smartphone under the tree So the store is all of a sudden flooded and those of us behind the long wooden hightop table in the back of the store are asked to come out and help customersTheres only one guy scheduled for an appointment and he wont be here for another twenty minutes so I go and start selling Things and Thingrelated accessories Well this guy lets call him Ted comes in and just stands there staring at a computer Hes not touching it not reading anything Just staring at it I wander over to him and give him the normal routine At this nondescript nameless computer company you never ask Can I help you or other questions that could end a conversation with a single word So you just engage the customer and start conversing about whatever it is theyre looking at Ingratiate yourselfHe waves me away says hes waiting for something so I wander off and help someone else The appointment time comes so I go back behind the long wooden hightop table check to see if my guest has checked in He hasnt so I shout out above the noise Ted Is there a Ted in the house Ted FNo response So I go back to helping customers Well ten minutes later my manager wanders over with Ted who Id talked to just before and starts berating me in front of my customer about why I didnt get ahold of him I try to explain that I did talk to this man he waved me away and then I shouted for Ted for a solid thirty seconds from behind the long wooden high top table Manager Fred also a fake name wont hear itSo I resolve to deal with Manager Fred later and go on to help the customer Well after ignoring me twice hes in no mood to deal with my attitude problem He reaches into his bag and pulls out a  notebook computer with an aluminum case thats been dinged to hell I ask him what the problem seems to be and he begins to rant Its too long to write here so Ill just touch the major points Only two months old screen suddenly broke while he was asleep shoddy workmanship battery only lasts five hours blah blah blahI open the screen and press the power key The screen lights up but is fed to all hell What had happened was that hed placed a pen pencil stylus tiny marital aid or some other device on the keyboard and had tried to close the lid I carefully examined the machine just trying to buy time because I knew he wouldnt react well to what I was going to tell him then took a deep breath and plunged inSir as it turns out the cause of your issues with the LCD is a pen that was placed on the keyboard on this row of keys here I can replace the LCD but because this is accidental damage it isnt covered by your ThingCare planThose were the magic words All of a sudden this guy is bright red and bulging out of his shirt I attempted to stay calm but this guy was scaring the living hell out of me He starts to shout about how Im attempting to rip him off and this computer was working just fine and he doesnt even own a pen and how dare I accuse him of being so stupid and a hundred other thingsI wait for him to finish and then I told him Sir Im sorry but as you can see on the LCD to which he replies by screaming at me about how I need to get off the drugs and stop hallucinating before I come to work Im sorry sir Thats LCD not LSD As you can see the LCD has two distinct points where the ends of a long thin cylindrical object came in contact with the screen and crushed it Thats why theres these jagged points Its like how a windshield spiderwebs if a rock bounces on the highway and hits itWell hes had enough of my attitude problem now Hes leaning over the long wooden hightop table and yelling six inches from my face using some seriously vile language to threaten lawsuits against my job and my company He even at one point alluded to the idea of waiting in the parking lot for me My manager heard the word lawsuit and was there in a flash to try to defuse the situation which failed spectacularlyManager Fred attempts to tell Ted the same thing I did while Im backing away slowly Manager Fred always had a gift for antagonizing people and this guy was already close to physical violence Finally Ted shouts Thats NOT accidental damage THIS is accidental damageHe picks up his  computer by a corner and flings it across the long wooden hightop table as if hes Oddjob from GoldenEyehttpimgurcomLZIvhA It barely missed me and smashed the white plexiglass behind me Someone had apparently heard the commotion and ran to get the mall security who saw the guy throw the notebook at me and tackled him to the groundAfter an arrest for assault and attempted battery police reports sworn statements and all sorts of other mess Im now well over my  hours of work and into hour  and the store is still yet to be cleaned up for closing I clear it with my fellow workers then go to the office in Back of House and ask Manager Fred if I can be excused early as Ive just suffered a near injury and a terrifying experience and the adrenaline I was running on has run outManager Fred launches into a truly insulting speech about my incompetence in defusing situations how Im too lazy to do my job and just as hes starting in on me about trying to take off work early cause Im a big pussy he notices Ive got my iPhone firstgen gifted to me by my former company when it premiered out and asks what the hell Im doingI reply I just put in my two weeks via email so its in writing He hears the email ding on the iMac behind him shouts You dont get two weeks Youre fired NOW and escorts me out I smiled the whole way out and the next morning I went to the labor offices for my states government and filed a report Manager Fred was called in for a hearing some short days later Of course he lied his ass off even attempting to say I never turned in a resignation letterI proved I did by showing them the email on my phone and the labor board ruled that because I was fired as a result of turning in twoweek notice I was entitled to the full  hours of pay I should have received had I been allowed to complete the work I thanked them gave Fred a mocking bow so that I came down to his height and walked out The pay was direct deposited into my account the day after the hearingSo thats my story Never told that one in its full form before Thank you guys for the opportunity to get that night off my chest and for bearing with me through that  word soliloquy of a terrible nightTLDR Angry customer blames me for his poor circumstances manager agrees customer attempts to cut my head off with a notebook computer Oddjob stylehttpimgurcomLZIvhA I quit and get paid  hours I didnt work for my trouble,Why I quit working for

today will always ensure good service Sorry for the wall of textSo Im at the furniture store picking out a chair I decide on the one I like has  legs not too high or low comfortable average quality but a good price you know the deal and I place the order for the chair I want at the counterThe kind young lady said Thats all fine if you could just take this receipt to the warehouse around the back of the store and ring the green button they will bring it out for you She repeated this again as Im sure these simple instructions must baffle numerous customers each dayTake receipt to back of store ring green buttonSo I drive around to the back of the store where there are  cars waiting at the stores clearly signed warehouse door A middle aged woman another customer was being very animated with her hand signals about where I should pull up She was closest to the door then two other cars behind her So I pull up to the end of the line and Im walking towards the door when I hear from the woman in the front lets call her WIFWIF Excuse me Im first in line and Ive been waiting here for  minutes alreadyTo which I reply Thats fine Im just handing in my receipt as I ring the green button She looks baffledA young lad YL about my age comes out YL Hey mate hows it goingMe Well thanks Im just here to pick up a chairYL Looks at recepit Ok manOh these are right at the back of the warehouse

my things yetYL Im sorry have you handed in your receipt to someoneWIF Confused WhatYL I need your receipt to see what you purchased they would have told you to hand it in here when you were at the counterWIF They just told me to drive round here and youd give me my stuffYL Oh Im sorry they should have told you to ring the green bell I just need your receipt to know what to get from the warehouseWIF Ugh as she troddles back to her carBy now the other two customers had remembered that the cashier told them to hand the receipt in and were now at the warehouse door also So we had all handed our receipts in just as WIF had returned from her car with hersAs she hands it into YL she statesJust so you know I was here first the woman with the baby is next then the couple and this guy pointing at me who got here first is the lastAnd then it happenedYL gave me that look Im sure all of us in service have given that look The unspoken eye contact where we both know whats going on that

I GET MY STUFF FIRSTYL Looks at her receipt You purchased this at the counter  its now WIF Yeah  minutesThe looks between all of us now were pricelessYL Being polite enough not to make here look even more foolish Well Im very sorry but you didnt ring the bell so I didnt know you were here Ill go get your items nowYL hops on his forklift and we all return to our cars A minute later he returns with what seems to be some nursery furniture for the mother with the baby Im two cars length from WIF but I can still hear her claiming But I was first and Thats her job not yours as he is helping the new mother lift and fit heavy items into her hatchbackYoung mother drives offAnd then there were threeI was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen next but I was also not going the be surprised if he would return with WIFs furniture just to get rid of herBut nope Out YL comes with an outdoor dining set for the couple in the middleWIF Aw for FUCKS SAKEYL As hes passing her Yeah sorry this was right

yelling at me like all this is my faultWIF He better not bring your stuff back now you even said that youre not in a hurryMe UmmNo Im notWIF Why notIm pretty sure even she knew how stupid this question was after I gave her a confused look and chose not to answerThe heat was now on she was tapping her feet pacing back and forth shaking her head It was like someone had just told her  that someone had stolen her identity and used her credit cards to purchase shitty furniture and they also had to wait in lineAnd then it happened The knight in shining fluorescent returns with his forklift carrying one single chair He rode straight past WIF just smirking at me the whole time during his slow and steady voyageWIF You have got to be fucking shitting meYL just pays no attention as he very carefully helps me load up my chairMe I know how it is man youre doing this deliberately rightYL Yep And it just happens to be my smoke break now so she can wait at least another five We both shared a little chuckle as obscenities were being screamed in our directionI drove of with a sense of joy satisfaction and a well priced piece of Chinese assembled furniture All in all it was a good

pleasenoonions,78,76,1dxz92,492,Throwaway for obvious reasonsI work in a small clothing store that is present in most malls Because we sell brands that are affiliated with drugs and sometimes gang related emblems a lot of our shoplifter base are guys in gangs And we have A LOT of shoplifters the most in our mall A few weeks ago a coworker of mine and assistant manager of the store was working alone from openfive She is petite  and no more than  pounds We are going to call her Jane Due to our company policy approaching shoplifters must be with respect and kindness We may only offer to hold their items that were clearly stuffed in their bag up at the front for them Basically every approach towards a shoplifter must be riddled with a customer service angle Anyway back to the story So in walks two guys regular shoplifters We identify one of them in conversation with eachother as kiss lip tattoo guy as he and the rest of his inferred gang have a tattoo of a red kiss mark on their necks  This guy comes in all the time and gets away with boatloads of clothes He is the slickest motherfucker So Lip Kiss guy grabs some camo skinny jeans and asks for a fitting room Jane lets him in When he comes out he doesnt have the jeans in hand SHOCKER and he walks over to shop around some more Jane then notices that he has the camo jeans underneath the pants that he wore into the store as she can see the camo print peeking up from the top of his other pants waist band Then she notices that he his tightly gripping the sensor in his hands obviously looking for a hiding spot She walks over to him puts on her fake smile stands about six feet away and says J Did you find that on the floor I can take that for you and put it in our binKLG What the fuck are you talking aboutJ The sensor in your hand its the stores property and it will set off an alarm if you walk out with it I can put it in our sensor bin for youKLG I dont have nothin in my hands he says as he notsodiscreetly slips the sensor into his pocketJ Well I just saw you put it in your pocket Kiss Lip Guy then turns around so that his back is facing her then just as quickly turns back around and punches Jane square in the jaw while saying Dumb white bitchJane fell to the ground from the force of the punch after her neck whipped around and hit her head on our concrete floor A woman and her two very young girls run over crying as the woman tells Jane that she is calling  The men If you can even call them men calmly walk out of the store When Jane regains her ability to stand she chases after the men making a scene in the mall so that they will be caught She screams That man just punched me in the face over and over while pointing at the man All the other mall workers come out from their stores to see what the commotion is all about When Kiss Lip Guy hears her screaming he comes after her AGAIN He turns around running at her fists ready At this point a man working at another store runs out and creates a barrier between Kiss Lip Guy and Jane and this sends Kiss Lip Guy running A pack of mall workers chase after him and got his license plate number Jane is feeling really terrible at this point obviously in pain And the pain is even greater because not a week earlier Jane got a concussion while doing manual labor by herself at work and our company made her work a twelve hour shift the very next day The best part about this fucked up story Jane got punched around  o clock She immediately called our District Manager as our store is without any managers right now besides Jane who is a mere assistant still in her teen years and she explained the situation to Our DM while crying and obviously shaken up Our DMs response Haha Oh man that sucks Youre okay to work the rest of the day right Just let me know how things go Talk to you later And she hangs up ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME Jane then emails our DM explaining that she doesnt feel safe in the store and has had a horrible day and would like to recover at home Our DM responds Well who do you think is going to come in for you you are going to have to work with Manager from nearby store on that the message was very cold and unsympathetic in any way Jane then calls our Loss Prevention guy and explains the situation to him and the fact that our DM wouldnt let her leave His response Oh I understand yeah just go ahead and take a five in the back Freshen up Wow what a savior Thanks for the five mins off amirite Should be enough time to recover from being physically assaulted by a grown man Eight o clock rolls around one hour before closing time and Jane gets a call on her cell phone from human resources saying that she can leave Gee thanks Jane then has to work two days after this incident and every day for the rest of the week Jane sent an email to our DM on one of these days and explains that she is quitting and cannot work her two weeks for fear of being in the store They had not caught the guy that did this not to mention he is as I said in a gang the police confirmed this from his record of past assaults and gang affiliation and she feared for her safety I dont fucking blame her Our DM then called her threatening her saying that if she quits then she cannot use Store as a reference Really Worked here for three years and she cant use the store as a reference because she feels unsafe and doesnt want to be there anymoreFuck the company I work for ,How my best friend and coworker got brutally assaulted by a grown man in our store,568

queenmcgina,52,101,16xowv,486,So I use to work at a coop grocery store when I was  We had this family owned construction group that use to come in multiple times a week to buy our hot table food for lunch and get some cafe drinks and I was usually the one to ring them up They were always incredibly polite to us and the more senior employees knew them by firstname basis I had only been working there for a few months at this time and Im incredibly shy but they were slowly getting me to open upAt the time I was working there it wasnt mandatory to wear smocks so I was just in my every day clothes That day I was wearing one of my favorite shirts It was a picture of a squid and it said Free hugs I was working the register while their group came in and ordered their drinks so Im making small chitchat with them They ask me about my infant daughter and how we are both doing things had been really tough because I am a single mom so I greatly appreciated them asking Chitchat continues and one by one they start paying for their mealsThe mother this is a family owned construction company so they all work and own together and go to lunch together finishes paying for her meal and comes up to me from around the register counter and I am freaking out a little bit Maam Uhm is all I can mutter and she reaches out to give me a hug She says We all get a free hug with our meals today right and gave the warmest laugh I had ever heard And thats the story of my favorite hug,Free hugs,587
Osiris,60,101,1bag6d,490,Ive posted this story before but its been about a year and this is the perfect sub for it  Apologies for its length but its a semicomplex tale that deserves detailI worked at a rather busy gas station in a quite rich neighborhood for several years  I was the closing cashier rich people near an Interstate think that a hour gas station would bring in undesirables which actually gave me quite a bit of authority  The Manager usually left around pm and we were open until   So for six glorious hours I was king of my little domain which was the convenience store the  pumps the parking lot and the car wash which will figure into this storyIt was a rather nice spring day and nice days tend to mean that the car wash will be busy  Rich people with nice cars want their nice cars to stay looking like nice cars  I was inside selling cigarettes and trying to keep the local bored teens from stealing beer when a nice car drives at a higherthannormal speed up from the car wash through the gas pumps and parks in a fairly incongruous angle in front of the doors to the store  Out jumps an older lady somewhere in her late s dressed like she was trying out for Meryl Streeps part in The Devil Wears Prada  Kinda looked like Streep too  She marched toward the doors with a this transgression shall not stand look on her face  I steeled myself and put on the CS fake smileSadly its been a few years since this happened so I cannot quote the conversation verbatim but the upshot was that she was QUITE displeased with how clean her car was after going through the car wash  I apologized and offered to run her through again for free which was Standard Reply  for anyone having an issue with the car wash  Ah but that just wont do  Okay Standard Reply  was to offer to cut her into the head of the line something we didnt like doing because it made all the other customers mad  But that wouldnt do either  Standard Reply  refund the money  Nope that wont do eitherIm now perplexed  What did she want me to do  Which is what I asked her  Instead of getting an idea of whatever it was that she wanted done told to me I was instead impaled by a galeforce tirade about the quality of the store the employees our intelligence levels why we found it necessary to hire high schoolers and several choice coarse epithets that drew concerned and irritated looks from the two other women who were in the store with their childrenAt this point I realized that nothing was going to placate this harpy  I again apologized and offered to give her the card for the General Manager so she could talk to her  Which the lady slapped out of my hand but added that she wanted to know what I was going to do about this  I responded with I dont know maam you havent told me what you would like to happen  This of course set her off on another tirade but I was now the full focal point of her anger  The more general comments shed made earlier were now very specific insults about my intelligence my work ethic and my value as a human being  With several swear words thrown around quite a bitNow another minor bit of back story  There was a reason that at  I was working at a gas station  I was in school working on my second degreeIn law enforcementCustomer Service smile dropped away and it was replaced with Authoritative and Stern  Calmly I told this lady though she didnt fit any definition of the word I know exception the biological one that if she insisted on insulting me and the station and swearing in front of customers and their children then we didnt want her business any more that she was to leave and that any further contact would have to go through the GMIll give you a moment to allow your imagination to come up with a suitable idea of her reaction  Ill give you a hint it wasnt unicorns and rainbowsSo now I went from calm to rather loudly commanding her to leave the premises or else I would be calling the police  To which she seemed completely nonplussed and continued to rant  Now being someone whos going into law enforcement I dont bluff when I say Im gonna call in backup  So I made the call  Another bit of backstory the local police LOVED our store because we were one of the few places they could come get snacks at prior to graveyard shift and we called in DUII drivers to them on a regular basisFive minutes later here comes the blackandwhite cavalry  The officer whom Id had numerous official and unofficial interactions with comes into the store  I gave him the holy hell this idiot REALLY needs to be smacked and tossed out of here look and he gave me a what the shehag  Shes that much trouble look back  She then turned and lit into the officer about what happened lying the whole time  She said that I had threatened her that I had used racial and sexual slurs and that I hadnt actually gotten her car cleaned which was obviously theft  The officer turned and looked at me to which I simply responded We have five cameras and a microphone in the store  Everything has been recorded  If youd like I can call the GM and have her come down here and show you the tapes because thats not what happened at allThe officer escorted the lady outside where another newlyarriving officer faced the same tonguelashing  The first officer then took my statement and asked what I wanted to do  I told him that she had to be off the property and that she could talk to the GM in the morning but I didnt want to deal with her ever again  The officer smiled knowingly and walked back outsideWhat followed was the officer telling her that no matter what may have transgressed he could find no evidence of a crime and that since I was an employee here and had told her to leave she had to leave  PeriodIm kind of surprised that the ladys head didnt just explode right there due to high blood pressure  She started screaming at the cop almost incoherently  I could understand words or phrases here and there like never and treated and have your badge and fuck  But she wouldnt leave  The officer keeping his cool asked her three separate times if she was willing to leave  She wouldnt directly reply to the question just kept screamingSo he arrested her for criminal trespass  She did not go quietly  I applaudedNow this is where the REAL fun begins  Because as it turns out her rage slowly turned into dawning realization as she was driven to jail and she began to plead with the officers to be let go  When they declined she tried to name drop by stating that her husband was a circuit court judge for the very county we were inWhich turned out to be trueSo it became a minor bit of local drama  Since she was in fact married to a local judge none of the other judges in the county could try her case due to conflict of interest  Not just that county but two others as well seeing as how she was a social climber and therefore was heavily involved in social events elections political groups and such  She had to be tried in court almost  miles away  She plead guilty got a fine and did  hours of community service which really for that kind of trespass is a reasonable punishment  Her husband publicly quite humiliated retired early and divorced her  I never saw her again after the trial  My boss gave me a raise for dealing well with a difficult situation and a paid day off  I spent that day at the beach eating ice creamTLDR  Entitled shedevil tries to push around a wage slave he gets her arrested and gets mintchocolate chip in a waffle cone as a rewardEDIT  Some spelling and grammar issues,Yelling at the wrong guy or how a bitchy lady learned what handcuffs felt like,591
DeaditeQueen,89,121,1nqw8c,481,It seems most of my posts cause a myriad of emotional reactions from you dear readers It occurred to me while reading the comments on my last post that I have purposely avoided sharing the story of an event at the Vet Clinic that brought me to tearsLike many people who work with animals I am far from calloused to pain but learned to deal with it on a level where I didnt suffer burnout I always did my best to separate myself emotionally just enough to respect the grief of clients without wanting to jump in front of a car at the end of each shift But everyone has their breaking points and for the first time since it happened oh so many years ago I think it only fair to share it with all of youOur clinic was open on Saturdays but only for a few hours in the morning and with half the staff A majority of the scheduled appointments were for simple things like vaccinations and well checks We opened at am and I would arrive at  to open the front doors our Saturday vet and owner used the backdoor to arrive very early to review patient charts for the day and grab some coffee before the push Clients often called last minute demanding to get in nonemergencies and I would spend most of the morning convincing people to come on Monday etc Our appointments officially started at am giving time for the techs to set up prep vaccinations etcIt was about  when I heard a growling car engine screaming down the road I glanced out the window to see a green Suburban take the fastest and tightest corner into our lot that id ever seen Tires threw up smoke and left a long curve of skid marks This was BAD I yelled for a litter I didnt know what kind or animal or what size but I wanted to be readyI dashed out the door in time to see a young man early s jump from the drivers seat while the Suburban kept running He was vaguely familiar and his face was swollen and red the way a face can only be when youve been crying your eyes outHELP ME PLEASE he screamed in what was probably the most desperate and heart wrenching voice Ive ever heard He had pulled up half on the sidewalk leaving only about  feet from the back of his vehicle to the door He flung open the back to reveal the lifeless body of a beautiful all white husky mix Blood was pooled in the back of the Suburban and was smeared all over his furI looked only for a moment before our vet was by my side scooping the dog up and hustling him to the back Hed worked plenty if miracles before but my instinct told me this dog had passed way before getting to us The pure desperation in this young mans eyes was indescribable I had witnessed emotional pain on my levels but this was something different This was pure selflessness I know in my heart he would have changed places with his dog in a heartbeatFYI Im tearing up just remembering this The owner followed the vet to the back and told him that his father had been leaving for work and didnt see the dog snoozing in the shade of of the back tire and because the dog was older and hard of hearing he could only guess thats why the dog hadnt moved when his father started the car and backed over himWe had looks at the clinic Most of us could communicate with those alone and the vet have me a glance that said This could get gory back here take the owner upfront I gently took him by the crook of his arm and brought him upfront explaining they needed room to work He was in such a daze Im sure I could of led him into the path of an oncoming train and he would of simply followed As we reached the front area a white SUV came roaring in and a tall broad older man hopped out and ran in It was the father The young man turned to him but before a word could be said the door to the back opened and the vet emerged The young man spun back around and for a millisecond our eyes met and I KNEW I was looking in the eyes of a man praying for a true miracleThe vet put his hand on the young mans shoulder and simply said Im so sorryHe couldnt say anything else The young man fell to his knees pleading with unknown forces to not let it be true The fathers eyes welled up and tears fell He went to his sons side and helped him to his feet The sons posture shifted and before I could step back he balled up a fist and punched his father square in the jaw The father took several steps back from the blow then grabbed his son and forcefully pulled him into his arms restraining him with a bear hug and pleas for forgivenessThe son screamed and cursed his father while struggle to break free I was watching this and where Id normally be searching my brain for ways to defuse the situation I found my emotions getting tangled in their webThe son broke free and took another swing Dad saw it coming and easily sidestepped it all while crying himself and still begging forgiveness He grabbed his son again and when he tried to pull him into the bear hug the son countered by head butting him causing blood to immediately pour from the dads noseI had to try to shake off my own feelings and intervene Now Im a woman but not a waif Im almost  feet tall and far from a Kate Moss frame no Im not a huge fatty either I rushed in and put myself between the two hoping the presence of a woman in the line of fire would at least halt the physical fightIt did for a minute as the son turned his back on his father while declaring his hatred and how he wished his father had died instead of his dog Strong words even for that situation I lost control For the first time since my first euthanasia I lost itI began to sob and I couldnt stop the tears from streaming down my face The son turned and saw me standing their crying He pushed past his father and without even knowing each others names we embraced It seemed like hours that we just hugged each other As I gained more control over my emotions he continued to let his out but in a healthier way then punching his dad He buried his face in my shoulder and simply cried His father sat on one of our benches and buried his face in his hands to do the sameWhen neither of them had any more tears to cry they agreed to bring the dog home and bury him in the backyard They worked together like  pall bearers to bring the body out on a litter and gently set him in the back of the still bloody Suburban They didnt speak much they just did what needed doingAs they drive off and morning appointments who were always late began to arrive and I simply stared out of the window watching the father follow his son down the road like the somberest of funeral processions The rest of the day was a blur Even when we closed I still felt cloudy and sad and sat in my car crying for about  minutes after the last of the staff had left months later I see his face again The young man who had shared a deeply personal embrace with me He walked in all smiles and revealed a teeny Bengal kitten from under his coat He could never replace his lifelong pal so he had

fattyfatty,57,122,1hla0u,485,This happened a couple years ago when I worked at a store that sold magazines including all the awesomest mature ones That being said porn gets stolena lot Since it was one of my jobs to help reduce losses as well as stocking the new magazines I decided to start putting nogos on the porn On top of that I would quickly count the ones on the shelf every week and correct our inventory for missing ones usually  a week One night just after completing aforementioned task I leave to go home but since I was hungry I decided to eat fresh across the street first Well upon returning to pick up my car I notice that there are several police cruisers parked to block the entrances Intrigued I go inside to see what the hubbub is about Well I guess in the ten minutes or so that I was gone a group of four boys only  years old triggered the theft alarm Two of them just ran and two stayed behind My manager was a wizard at convincing people that they should stay since we couldnt actually make them staySo the police are there and we decide that they are just dumb kids so they shouldnt be charged The police call the kids parents and get the first two to give up the names of their accomplices They are being very calm and professional I for one dont much like the police They tell the kids that they are going to not be in trouble this time and how what they did was immoral and stuff like that I was going to leave at this point as it was really a boring and routine shoplifting procedureBut as I am leaving the office a lady comes in saying she is the mother of one of the two She was way too calm about the whole thing She asked if her kid was being arrested not worryingly more like she was making a note of how much dinner she needed to cook And when the officers say no she asks if they could anyway just to teach him a lesson The officers say they really cant if the store doesnt press charges which we really didnt want toAnyway enter mother  This lovely woman immediately starts yelling at the police for wrongfully detaining her child To which they explain that the boys not only admitted to it there was video evidence They also mention that they are not arresting or charging him so he is more or less free to go  Well she just refused to believe that her little angel would do such a thing And instead of taking her child and leaving with dignity she starts screaming all sorts of profanity at these  or  cops We are not in the office at this point we are on the sales floor at the entrance And she is yelling about how she will sue everyone here she even points at a few customers and threatens to sue them for I assume existing At this point the manager asks her to leave with her child To which she refuses Conveniently the police were there so they say she can leave on her own or they could remove her for us Begrudgingly she leaves still yelling But only for a couple minutes She came running back in throwing rocks I shit you not ROCKS The police were in the office just chatting with the manager about something when one of them shatters the window between the office and the floor I rarely enjoy watching police arrest people but my god did it feel good to see that woman pepper sprayed As I was leaving for the final time that night the first overly calm mother looks at me and said I always hated that bitchTLDR Woman refuses to believe her child would steal adult magazines and resolves the issue by throwing rocks at my manager and the police ,Yes your child would and did steal porn,607

crazy isgettingcalledatsomepoint stories Im going to share a story that happened just after I stopped working at that station which should help me feel better and restore just a tad bit of faith in people for everyone elseIn July of that year I was fired from the station  This came about because I had been caught by corporate on my cell phone while at work didnt matter that I was getting a call from my mom telling me that my Grandma who was in hospice had just slipped into a coma and probably wouldnt make it through the weekend and the manager had no choice but to send ol Osiris a pink slip  I dont look good in slips and pink is SO last year  Seriously keep up with fashion trendsAnyway while I was no longer an employee I was still there on a semiregular basis  Several of the coworkers were good friends of mine and lived in the area and my grandmother the other one the one in a coma didnt make it through the weekend  She was  and I miss her terribly lived just a mile away  So I was in the area visiting on a regular basis  The station had good prices for gas and a decent beer selection so I would stop in and chatAs I turned on to the cul de sac I realized that there was a news van in the parking lot of the station its antenna extended and what looked a lot like an interview being conducted in front of the store  I thought to myself Self for that is what I call myself this isnt normal  I looked around but couldnt see any police cars firetrucks ambulances or other governmentalemergency vehicles that may provide a clue as to whats going on  So I park walk over to the corner of the store out of camera shot light up a cigarette and proceed to try and overhear whats going onThe reporter resplendent in his dark blue Imonthesceneofahumanintereststory blazer was speaking to the camera about someones generosity  However I didnt see anyone with him aside from the camera man and a rather boredlooking broadcast tech  Strange  Stubbing out my cancer stick I walk into the store to see a couple of my old coworkers  They are BEAMING  Not that stupid forced customer service smile weve all had to shove onto our faces like a bad Dia de los Muertos mask but real honest smiles of joyOkay guys whats going on  The news is here and youre all smiling wider than when we got those surprise Christmas bonuses last yearOne of the guys then explains whats been happening all day  Early in the morning a man came in and asked to speak with the manager  They went back to the officer and talked for a short while after which he came out with a happy smile and she the manager came out looking stunned  The man then went outside and stood in the middle of the pumps waiting for the next car to arrive  As it drove up he walked around to where the attendant was talking to the driver  The man held up his hand to stop the conversation pulled out a  bill from his pocket and said fill them up its on meAnd he had been doing that for ever person who came into the store  All day long  When I arrived hed been doing it for about  hours  He hadnt left onceThe station had become quite busy about an hour after the guy showed up as people called their friends and family and told them to come get free gas  Even in a town as affluent as that one  a gallon isnt exactly cheap  It had died down as the evening wore on but the man was pointed out to me still standing out there at the pumps talking with one of the attendants  I asked the cashier whyApparently the guy had recently been given a rather large inheritance one he didnt feel that he should keep  So he decided that the best way to get rid of the money was to make a whole bunch of people very happy by filling their tanks  Over and over and overThe reception by the community was shock then a little suspicion then grateful thanks  Many people had told him throughout the day how that rather small act for him had made their day or week so much easier  Several people who had been emptying change jars just so they could have enough gas to get to work were suddenly looking at full tanks  Tears were shed  Lots of them  The entire station staff was in the best mood Id ever seen  And obviously someone had tipped off the local news because they were down there covering the story for the evening newsNot everyone had taken him up on his offer  A few had declined so that one more person other than them could get it  A few standoffish people didnt want anyone thinking they were getting charity  But the vast majority of people simply thanked the man and left the station holding money they had expected to spend and smiling broadlyI never found out how much the guy spent that day but it had to be a lot  Our average intake per day was well over  so it wasnt cheap for him at all  I also dont know where he kept

PasswordIsntClop,79,92,171wlv,475,At the store I worked at there wasnt a line for returns In fact the person doing returns was also the only cashier This worked about as well as you think it would it didntIf a customer had a return they would wait by the side of the register until the cashier had cleared the line then if anyone had a return they would get serviced If someone came along and wanted to check out during the return they would have to call for back up It suckedSo a black man comes into the store and needs to return something No problem  I direct him towards the cashier who has two people in line He waits patiently for the cashier to finish and once the line is empty starts the returnNot five seconds after she greets the customer and begin his return does a black woman come JOGGING down the aisle waving her arms in the air at the cashier screaming HEY HEY HEYShe gets up to the register and starts berating the cashier She claims that the cashier had seen her coming and because she was black rushed to get the other black person there in front of her to intentionally delay her checking out because she was black That the cashier was racist and did not want to check out a black person and proved it by doing a return for a different black personAbsolutely mind boggling what her logic was Long story short the cashier thankfully did NOT say but hes black too because Im sure that would have caused a shitstorm They called a manager who opened a new lane and checked out the angry woman and didnt give her any coupons She complained and pitched quite a fit over the cashier being racist but thankfully the manager clearly saw that it was bullshit and did not budge,Well since were talking about customers pulling race cards,567
CurvedStraightLine,85,90,1f71l7,474,My last retail management job I was getting out of my car when a guy grabbed my door and held it half open  The wall blocked behind me so he was effectively stopping me from being able to go anywhereGive me your money  He said aggressive voicedWithout thinking I said noGive me a dollar he responds less aggressiveI repeated no and he looked downward and sad then responded ok ok and wandered offI rushed into work only to find out that the same had happened to a coworker only she gave him money  We called the cops and were told they were already on their waysomeone else had called in the same issue  As soon as the cops arrived blues flashing several other people rushed out of the nearby grocery store  This guy had tried to rob them also  Altogether there were probably a dozen people freaking out and it was devolving into a full scale panicNext thing you know with a cop standing next to me taking my statement beside the cop car the guy comes right back to me and says again Give me your money  The cop immediately grabs the guy who begins to bellow and yell incoherently in confusionI dont hear anything more about it for a few days then I happen to look out over the parking lot and theres our friend harrassing an old lady  I call the cops againThe cops take him away a second time and one of them tells me that I should continue to call him inbut dont be surprised if someone tells me otherwiseLater that day I get a call from a social worker who says he heard I had an issue with Johnny  Turns out Johnny isnt really all there and lives at a medical facility nearby  Somehow Johnny has found out that if he demands money people will give it to him  But I shouldnt think of it as unarmed robbery  I should see it as aggressive panhandlingThey were working on the issue he said but it would help if people would stop giving him money  Doing so only reinforces the behavior  It would be helpful to tell my customers just not to give any money to the large aggressive man demanding their wallet  Did I have an email list or something to reach out to themI took his name and contact info then called corporate  Corporate I have found lives for this stuff  They contacted attorneys against him contacted the mall landlord and we all got a memo that the guy was banned from mall property and we should call police if we even saw him regardless of what he was doingJohnny was arrested over a dozen more times  ,Aggressive Panhandling,564
lokigodofchaos,69,143,1nud0o,467,After I graduated college I got a job at a big box home improvement store while I looked for jobs in my field One day typical suburban mom TSM come in wanting to buy paint  TSMs are generally clueless about the process of painting so I make sure to guide them through the steps She seemed pretty grateful for the help and was pleasant so far Once we selected a color I asked her how many square feet she was painting to determine how many gallons she needed She of course didnt know so I asked her how tall her walls were the estimated dimensions of the room and the number of windows and doorsMe Okay so with the room being  by  with  foot high ceilings you are looking at  square feet of painting surface Minus doors and windows you can probably get away with a gallon of paint  per coat TSMWow that was fast you must be one of the ones that graduatedI was shocked Was this a compliment She was implying that my fellow employees were all drop outs who couldnt do simply multiplication Most of us in my department were college students or recent graduates We worked there because the job market sucked and the hours were flexible for classes I pretended it didnt phase me and politely upsold the hell out of her Premium rollers and brushes she would probably only use once  Frogtape high end masking tapeand I mixed her paint in the more expensive line of paint,Was that supposed to be a compliment,610

levirain,77,107,1nnfjf,473,Up until recently I worked at a fairly small GardenFloralGift store in Minnesota There are  of these stores all of which are in Minnesota Now I had been working at this store for about  years so I know the ropes around this place When we are short staffed or no manager can be found I act as supervisormanagerThis story happened I wanna say sometime in Early October last year The manager on Duty MoD in this story was actually the same one as in the firsthttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsltnymaybeifyoudidntwantmetocallthepoliceyou story I posted Now before I get into the story a little background on our return policy since that is what this is about For everything with a receipt you have  days with out is kind of up to us but you only get store credit for the LOWEST price we have had it all year Perennials trees and shrubs with a receipt you have  years we need the actual plant as well with out is again really up to us but you get the LOWEST price we have sold it for in the last year So if you bought an item at  tried to return it without a receipt and the item is now a sale item you get the sale price back as store credit Annuals and plants that wont survive MN winters are only warrantied for  days if you bought them AprilSeptemberOK story time As I said it is early October probably second week in I am the only cashier working in the hardgoods area of the entire store A lady comes in with what looks like  almostdead rose bushes I start my usual Oh have a return I can help you here When she sets the plants down I notice they are Hybrid Tea roses not considered hardy in MN I ask her if she has a receiptC NoMeOkwell without a receipt all I can do is store credit at the lowest sales price we have sold them forOctober st our Hyrid Teas go down to  a piece so she is getting CwhatI bought these at  just a few days agoMeOur hybrid roses have been  for two weeks nowCWell I dont remember when I bought thembut I paid MeI have no way of knowing if you got them during our sale or not without a receipt Our policy is without a receipt lowest sale priceCWell that is just fucking ridiculousMeI know I am sorry but that is the company policyCWell then just let me fucking exchange them the new ones will have the two year warrantyMeAfter September we dont warranty any hybrid rosesCAre you fucking kidding meMeHybrid roses arent Minnesota Hardy they wont last our cold wintersCThen just fucking return them for the  I paid for themMeAgain company policy is that you get the LOWEST price that we have sold them for in the year it is against policy but I will skip the  dollar price and give you  back for each since that is what they were all of SeptemberCI remember what I fucking bought them forMeWithout a receipt this is all I can doC get me a fucking manager if you are going to be so difficultGreat MoD is a fucking kissass to customers Bends over backwards doesnt stand up for her employees and takes their crap I just know this chick is going to get here wayMeAlright MoD is way out back I will call her up but it may take a minute or two if you would like to sit downI call up MoD and while we are waiting I can her the customer on her phone bitching about how ridiculous I am being and how I shouldnt be here alone because I am so incompetentYea fuck yourself lady I offered to break policy for you I am not getting written up because you couldnt keep a receiptA few more minutes pass and MoD still isnt up the customer starts bitching about the wait I repage MoD and she tells me she got stopped but will be up when she can One of the horticulturist happened to walk inside while I was siting at the counter with the roses She came over and we were talking about them and I explained everything to her Hort is a sweet little old lady love her to death and she hates when customers are rude to workersHortWell thats to badMeHopefully MoD says the sameHortyou know this rose have dirt caked on its branches dont youHort begins to tell me that she thinks the customer bought the rose over a year ago wintered it over with the MN Tip method but it didnt last the summer So this plant may be EXTREMELY out of warranty We double check the tag since we print the year on them and surprise that part is missing Hort runs off to tell MoD our findingsMoD finally comes up with hort asks me if what Hort said is true and I agree All three of us walk over to the customerMoDSo you are wanting to return the two hybrid rosesStill on the phone CYes but I want the price back that I paid for them and apparently your cashier is to incompetent to do that for meMoDOur policy is lowest sale price in the last yearCI didnt pay no  dollars for two rosesMoDI am sorry but withoutCI shouldnt have to fucking keep my receipt you should be able to just look it upHortDoes Big Box Store down the road do that for youCI bet they would since the appreciate my businessMoDok wellwe arent suppose to but I can offer you the second highest sales price of Cyour cashier tried to pull that shit with me too I paid   fucking  a piece for these and I want that backWithout saying anything more MoD nods her head Ok she says I am flabbergasted this is the most I have seen her argue before and she just gave upMoDjust return them for the full price The customer smirked like full force smirk I think thats where I had itMeYou log in the register then I am not breaking policy under my log in LP guy would have my head you are a manager under your log in he would know someone okd itMoDI cant have you ring under my name its against policyHortFine then do it yourself this whole thing is against policy LeviRain and I are going on breakHort and I sat in the office a few feet away and listened to this customer bitch about her and I until MoD was done with the return,Do it yourself,580
toxlab,96,97,1gzb0c,468,This tale takes us back to my very first employment Given the median age around here this means that most of you were either crawling around pooping your diapers or were still just a glint in the mailmans eye As usual Ill probably be verbose TLDR to followIm still all gung ho about customer service In my teenage rubric I know the secret of keeping customers happy and everyone else must be doing it wrong Whats so hard about selling Big MacsAnd then I met my first intractable customer Well call him BillBill was probably around eighty He walked with the careful deliberate pace that comes from knowing that youre one broken hip away from being a terminal invalid He apparently was supposed to have a walker but refused to use it The upshot of this was that you could see him coming from a mile away As soon as he mounted the stairs outside you had a good ten minute window before he made it to the counter In future visits I would spend that time getting everything prepared just right But at this point he is a stranger to meHe makes his way to the empty counter at a glacial pace The dining room was empty It was a bit like watching someone traverse a minefield one hesitant toe forward transfer weight to the heel slowly slide the other foot forwardI give him the standard spiel Big grin Welcome to McD He cuts me off with a guttural grunt Im sorry sir  GRUNT Im sorry I cant understand you Can you speak upARBLEGARBLEBLARGHBA This guys got marbles in his mouth I start to panic What do I do here Do I get a piece of paper and ask him to write it down Point to the menu I see my shift leader rounding the corner to the office I call out to her She looks up sees him and comes overBill she says this is toxlab Hes new He doesnt know you yet Hell get your order but you have to be nice She runs me through his order Every day he comes in and gets the same thing Fish sandwich cheapest thing on the menu This entitles him to use a senior discount for a free small coffee He wants a small water and two lemons On the tray not in the water He takes two creams and three sugars Three Not four Not two Three One plastic stirrer And he wants three napkins Placed on his tray away from the lemons This order nets the store the grand total of  And God help you if you get any of that wrong At first I pity him I think maybe he had a stroke Maybe thats why he has trouble getting around and speaking My shift leader says thats not the case Hes been a pain in the ass for a year now He can speak perfectly fine She knows this because he threw a temper tantrum in the lobby after a kid was being stupid near his table The cops showed up and all of a sudden he could speak just fineI found this out when the senior card program decided that card holders had to pay tax for their free drink I had no idea until I rang him up and it came to HE LOST HIS FUCKING MINDHe went ballistic Suddenly I could understand every word out of his mouth Most of them were insults to my mother The word asshole got a lot of use too Other customers around the restaurant are prairie dogging Heads are popping up I try to cut in Sir IIf youll just let meIll get Nothing doesnt slow him down at all A customer leaves the dining room to come to my aid He engages Bill Now they are both yelling I am very confused I turn and run to the back My shift leader is doing inventory in the basement I tell her whats happened She sighs Shes too busy to deal with Bill today Call the police Okay the cops I can handle this I babble into the phone and return to the front Surprisingly Bill has quieted down some The guy he was arguing with went from respectful but annoyed to flaming mad and ready to kick ass I think Bill sensed he was getting close to having that hip break He turned and made his way towards the door like some foul mouthed tortoise I breathed a sigh of relief Two days later Im back at my post I see him approaching Oh shit The other cashier today is a trainee Hey shes gotta learn sometime right I didnt totally throw her under the bus I told her everything I could in the three minutes it would take him to make it inside Grab the tray lemons napkins She gets the water Ring in the sandwich Dont pour the coffee yet hell say its cold Two creams three sugars Hes getting close Fish will be up right in time to ring him through Out of sight We got this He makes it up to the counter He gets the welcome Hrmrmrm The regular today Coming right up she turns and gets the fish I stand nearby making happy meal boxes Watching Waiting for this to get bad She totals  No reaction Thank God Lemons far away from napkins Good She sets the coffee on the tray He grabs it takes the lid off and throws it in her face She drops to the floor screaming I yell the shift leaders name I get a cup of water and start pouring it on the girls face Shift manager comes out Sees us Sees Bill holding his empty cup looking at nothing I tell her what happened She vaults the counter grabs Bills shirt He puts his arms up She steps inside his hip and judo tosses him to the floor  is called These many years later I remember the girl was burned but okay I dont remember what exactly happened to Bill I dont think he got jail time I know he was never allowed in the restaurant again And I know why he did what he did He was upset because when she put the coffee on the tray the lid wasnt secure and a drop of coffee got out and got on his napkins TLDR Old man terrorizes fast food joint assaults worker because napkin got damp Thanks for hanging in there I know

UptownShenanigans,90,84,1kfn59,469,I work as a pharmacy tech and I hate MondaysNot in a Garfield kind of way No its because on Mondays apparently everyone and their mother decides that this is the day theyre picking up their medication from my pharmacy Were talking over  prescriptions in the span of about  hours This isnt necessarily a bad thing since it makes the time go by faster However it gets grueling after awhile especially when people begin to wear you down with their nonsenseWell today was no different I got off my break at around pm which is the start of what I have dubbed the afterwork pill brigade  the long long line of people going through our one drivethru window on their way home from work Well right after I put my lab coat back on it started and did not stop for  hours Personally I think drivethru pharmacy is stupid If things run smoothly its great because I can get your info snag your drugs and get you on your way in less than  minutes However if one of the many things go wrong it takes a long time to fix if we even can and we get in trouble if a person stays at the window for too long And here is where my story startsAbout one hour into nonstop customers at drivethru a woman pulls up asking for her meds now referred to as grumpy woman or GW Things start out normal Shes a little crass at first but this isnt surprising I get her namebirthdayaddress and type it into the computer Bing She has one ready in the waiting bin The conversation goes like thisMe Ok Mrs GW you have one ready Let me go geGW Wait there should be two That one and another but I dont remember the nameMe Ok do you remember what doctor prescribed itGW It was Dr Blah She said she sent it yesterdayIts seriously annoying how often doctors dont call in prescriptions when they tell their patients they didMe Well I dont see it and I cant contact your doctor since I dont have any of her info Would you like to just buy your one right now and call her tomorrowGW No Im going to call her right nowMe Ok but maam you cant stay at the window There are people behind you so youll need to either come inside or pull around to the back of the lineGW Im not coming insideMe Then please pull aroundShe drives off a huff and I help the next couple people in line Well she pulls up again but this time shes on her cell phone She thrusts the phone in my face and saysGW Heres the doctor Talk to herMe Uhh sure Hi this is Uptown how can I help youMD annoyed Ok so just refill Mrs GW medicationMe But we dont have an original prescription for itMD Fine Give her

FredFltStn,49,237,1p6aku,465,When I was  I got my first real job as a delivery driver with a national red roofed pizza chain The hours and pay were terrible but Ive always been an over achiever so i worked hard and quickly rose to assistant manager I was exciteduntil I figured out the promotion actually meant longer hours more responsibility and a set salary rather than hourly pay There were some weeks where I figured out i was actually making around hour with all of the hours I was working Still I did my best figuring at least I had a jobThe manager of my restaurant was two years older than I was He had actually started as a driver at that very same restaurant Apparently he had knocked up one of the waitresses shortly after he had started and after a shotgun wedding they were happily married with a baby The owner of the franchise had either felt sorry for him or taken a shine to him either way he had quickly risen to manager at the restaurant Ive seriously just spent  minutes trying to figure out how to sum up this manager in writing As an alternative Im simply going to list a series of adjectives that best describe him Incompetent sexist thief cheater misogynist liar irrational narcissistic dimwitted perverted lazy incompetent I realize I listed incompetent twice but one really didnt seem to do him justiceUnfortunately this gem of a manager drove away all but the most hardcore or insane help shortly after they were hired I would go to the trouble of interviewing and hiring help only to have him quickly drive them away My favorite was the waitress I hired who never even bothered to show up She had been warned about the manager by a friend after I hired her and was smart enough to abandon the jobAfter six months of working split shifts amp  hours per week I was ready to abandon the job as well but I couldnt bring myself to quit I had never quit a job before and my yearold brain decided it would be better to be fired then to quit Unfortunately my manager knew that he was screwed without me and I under estimated his resolve to keep me thereFor some reason I felt loyal to the hourly employees and I didnt want to just not show up for shifts and make their lives worse In retrospect I attribute this to Stockholm syndrome Instead I began to act out while I was workingIf a customer was rude or of obnoxious to my staff I would tell him off and throw him out If you complained about our delivery times I would cordially tell you to order your god damn pizza from somebody else If your children ran around the restaurant screaming I would offer to have them muzzled My incompetent manager thought all of these things WERE HILARIOUSOne busy Friday night we ran out of clean plates cups and silverware Normally the drivers would wash dishes between runs but of course they were out on deliveries and the manager had no intention of washing dishes As Im standing in front of the dish sink trying to catch up a stack of pizza pans falls over into the sink and drenches me I am officially at the end of my ropeWhile I am not proud of what happened next I feel it is pertinent to the story so Im going to include it I can only hope my mother never sees thisI stripped off my wet clothes and continued to wash dishes wearing only my shoes and an apron The manager came back to get clean plates and saw me in my new dishwashing attire He looked shocked for all of two seconds and then busted out laughing The rest of the staff took turns coming back to see what was so funny Thank God this was before the invention of camera phonesI was officially a broken man I figured that if this didnt get me fired nothing would I arranged to take a few days off and one week later two friends and I left for a  day spring break vacation in Florida All three of us desperately needed some time awayOn the day we arrived we drove by the Disney casting center where job interviews for potential Disney employees took place On a whim we pulled into the parking lot went into the building and all filled out applications  After hours of waiting we were all interviewed I decided not to put naked dishwasher as part of my experience  years later two of us are still employed by the Walt Disney Company The third person eventually moved back home to get married to her high school sweetheart and raise a familyI quit my pizza job from a pay phone in Florida after we had gotten the news that we were all hired at Disney The pizza restaurant manager cried during the call I never washed dishes naked at work again At work Sorry about the Tales From BEFORE a Fireworks Tent in the title Just wanted to make sure my Reddit friends saw it ,How a terrible manager changed my life Tales From BEFORE a Fireworks Tent,702

turned around and told her in no uncertain terms that yelling and cursing is one thing but touching me when Im driving is another I wasnt telling her to get out  degrees remember but I did tell her that if she does that again Im throwing her out She apparently had had enough of my warm Mercedes and decided to leave on her own In the middle of the highway at  am on footAs soon as she got out I locked the doors put on the emergency blinker and called the cops I told them what happened and where I am and started driving about  meters behind the lady as she started walking Funnily enough she walked the way where I was driving so she didnt even turn around to walk the way she wanted to go so bad At one point she realized its freezing out there and came by the door and gestured me to let her in I opened the window just a bit and told her that shes not coming in my car again and that Ive called the cops She asked me to at least let her have her hat and gloves I checked the back seat and sure enough they were there I threw them out of the window for her so she wouldnt freeze to death while we wait for the copsAfter maybe  minutes of me frantically flashing my brakelights to passing vehicles to warn them of  me driving walking speed on the highway and  this crazy lady actually WALKING on the highway we got to the second ramp that we were supposed to take When we were on top of the ramp the police arrived Not just one patrol either but three Slow night for them I guessWhen the police talked to her she seemed genuinely remorseful and lucid I was actually thinking that the cops think that Im the bad guy here since she put on the act so well I told them that  minutes ago she was completely different She agreed to pay me for the whole trip and asked me if I would take her the rest of the way I told her no and she totally understood and apologized some more The police told her that they could take her homeAfter she had paid me by credit card so the officer didnt actually see if the payment went through the officer asked me if everything was good and paid for I told him yes And now she went batshit insane again She started yelling at the officer for asking such mundane questions OF COURSE THE PAYMENT WENT THROUGH YOU THINK I DONT HAVE ANY MONEY etc All around berating and cursing The cop tried to calm her down but in protest she threw her wallet with full force into the dark forest with a meter of untouched snow laying there The officer told her that she wouldnt be going home tonight and escorted her to the patrol car Im guessing the poor guys went searching for her wallet in the snow after I thanked them and went on my wayThe End,The lady who almost killed me and herself in the process of being crazy,575

CurvedStraightLine,46,90,1k8dh9,458,It was the after Christmas sale at my store which is as near hell as I want to get  Hordes of women would descend on our store in that one week ripping through clothes destroying the store  The workload shot through the roof as women decided they NEEDED one shirt but it wasnt available in their size and an employee would be tied up for an hour calling around for it only to find that the sole store that still had that size in stock had it on hold for a customer who may or may not ever come back  Worst the reduced prices on everything meant that our staffing decided by hourly sales was actually less than it logically should beManagement took turns closing the store during those hellacious weeks and I had the bad luck of closing during the presale  This was when we only opened the store to certain customers after hours an act that only ramped up the self entitlementThe store closed at six and reopened for the VIPs at   It was catered so as the droves descended on our store I sent employees to vainly grab up spilled and stained clothing and wipe up the wine splashed on the carpetThe event ended at  but the last VIP didnt leave until midnight  I turned around to look at the destruction that used to be high end retail  Clothes on the floor clothes literally drifted against the walls in the fitting room like snow after a blizzard  Heaps of put backs burying the tables they were on  All of which was punctuated with abandoned plates with half eaten food grapes chased under tables cheese trampled into the carpet underfootI rallied my crew doing my best to beat their demoralization and we set to reassembling the store  I signed them all out for extra labor hours with an email to corporate and tucked into the big clean  Along the way we abandoned uncomfortable high heels and jackets  I ended up half in clothing out of my gym bag hair pulled back just battling the mess left behindBy  we almost had it licked  Then I heard the noise of someone yanking the doorWe actually had an issue at this location where people would pull the doorhandle repeatedly  Our neighboring store actually had their door handle ripped off by customers just not accepting that the store might be closed And this was obviously one of those times  The customer was just banging at the door to get inThey looked tipsy which made sense  There were two restaurants in the mall that served mixed drinks until the wee hours  They probably had just gotten kicked outPuzzling over why they were here I remembered that a set of keys had been found earlier in the evening  So I summoned my best retail smile I could muster and unlocked the doorThey instantly shoved the door open hitting my foot but I wasnt about to let them in  Through the open crack they looked at me confused Are you openI know that question deserved a firm but polite no but instead it just broke my brain  I stammered out a confused nno  NoShe stared at me confused for a minute and then asked if she could come in and shop around a littleI still was not processing this  The stupidity of it just made my brain cease and I just kept repeating No at herShe turns to her friend and says something about having to come back tomorrow in a snarky voice  At which point one of my employees fueled with retail rage comes up behind me and yells It IS tomorrow and slams the door shut on themThey stood outside peering in for a while while we finished cleaning but they were gone by the time we left at am,The question that broke me,548

melodyponddd,73,121,159iyd,463,So it was another night in the fitting rooms It was an especially busy day in the red and khaki store The new Jason Wu clothing line had just dropped and a bunch of women were waiting outside the door before opening as if it were Black Friday Knowing I was scheduled in the Fitting Room I had a wave of anxiety crash over me but I held my head high I knew I could do this The doors opened and sure enough all the women went rushing to the clothing line I busied myself as much as I could while I braced for the oncoming stormIt actually wasnt too bad All the women were incredibly respectful of one another If a woman tried on something that didnt fit a complete stranger would ask if they could try it on People were becoming friendly with each other swapping clothes laughing while they waited in line It was very pleasant As the day went on the Jason Wu items were scarce The accessories the scarves and handbags were the first to go I found myself having to make calls to our surrounding stores to see if they had any in stock Some did some didnt There was a nice AfricanAmerican couple trying things on I struck up a conversation with the boyfriendhusband while his girlfriendwife was trying on clothes Enter Rich Old Bitch This woman came to my desk decked out head to toe in animal fur clothing designer hand bag nails done and her face freshly Botoxed Her fake nose was as far in the clouds as I could see ROB Excuse me but I would like to know where all the handbags are You know how in movies and television shows rich people have thataccenttone of voice where it just oozes with Im rich therefore Im better than you That is how she sounded Me Im sorry maam we sold out of those fairly quickly If you would like I can call other stores for you  The lady said that was fine and she waited while I called up stores During this time I noticed she was very put off by the African American couple Her nose kind of scrunched and she pursed her lips The African American gentleman was very nice said hello to her and tried to make conversation The old woman didnt have any of it After a while I hung up the phone and told the lady that one of the stores still had one handbag left Since they are a promotional item it couldnt be put on hold but if she left now shed have a good chance of making it The lady said that was fine and asked what store it was I told her the location Now I live in a primarily rich town Myself and my family arent rich by any means but we are surrounded with rich folks This location was in a safe area but not the wealthiest area in town She came out with this lovely statement ROB Oh never mind I dont want to shop where all the poor black people and illegals shop The couple had left at this time but they were still within earshot The boyfriend went to turn around but the girl stopped him I was furious with this woman From the way she treated the couple up until now i just couldnt stand her ignorance So I came up with a white lie on the spot Me EXCUSE ME Ill have you know my stepfather who is a lawyer is black How dare you If you need any more help I will call one of my associates because I refuse to help you The lady did not know what to say She paled and mumbled an apology and got the hell out of the store The couple approached me and the boyfriend asked if my stepdad really was black Me Nah I dont even have a stepdad I knew I couldnt yell at her so I got back at her the only way I could making sure she knew she was an embarrassment The guy laughed gave me a fist bump and told me to have a good dayTLDR Called a racist old bitch out for being a racist old bitch,Another story of a fitting room associate Or the time I lied to a racist lady so she could put her foot in her mouth,584

Broniba,58,105,1p0b7t,453,Backstory So at my little corner of coffee house bliss we have an extra room attached to our main shop that used to be a liquor store  when it closed we bought it and turned it into an event room that people could rent out for meetings parties what have you Its not part of the general shop and we reinforce this by keeping the door closed  however it isnt always locked because potential renters often want to see the space to see if itll fit their needs what they need to rent so far as furniture yada yada All this to say room is there not supposed to be used unless you have reserved and paid for this room Well last night as I was manning the bar I notice two ladies open that door and walk into the room Now these ladies had been sitting just the two of them at our largest table for over an hour at this point sipping their free cups of ice water They were both very obviously well to do  they gave off that vibe of Im rich and youre not and we both know it Well theyd been there until Id gone to the table about ten minutes earlier placing down the reserved table sign and letting them know that no rush but in about thirty minutes a group was coming in that had previously reserved that big table They didnt seem to have any problem with that at the time so I went back to work Didnt think about them again till my co worker says I wonder what theyre doing I look up and see the ladies disappearing into the room Well co worker is very new so I told him that if hed watch the bar for a minute Id go ask I honestly figured maybe theyd seen the room and were wanting to rent it or something So I walk back and was thoroughly puzzled to see them sitting at one of the tables in there still sipping on their waters  in the dark I might add No event equals no lights on in the room and only the light from the shop coming through the door window I open the door and the following conversation occurred with Rich Lady or RL from now onMe Hi there ladies Can I help you with anything RL Were just having a conversation There were getting to be too many people in there Me Haha I understand it gets a bit crowded sometimes Im sorry to tell you though that this room isnt part of the general shop area Its a special room we save for reservations RL But were just having a conversation kid you not same phrase twice as though I somehow missed it the first timeMe Maam Im sorry but this room can only be used for folks who have reserved and paid for it Cue facial expression that lets me the minimum wage plebe know exactly that she Ms Rich and Fancy Pants does not appreciate my trying to tell her that she cant have her way RL Ugh I know what this room is for Ive paid for it beforeWaitso you know what the room is for youve used it and noted that no one from the main shop wandered in and crashed your party yet you cant seem to understand why Im asking you to leave said room Honey Sugar pieuse the brains so well concealed by your bad dye job I think my confusion must have shown a lot because she rolled her eyes and huffed again I tried one more time Me Im really very sorry ladies but Im not allowed to let our regular customers use this room without reservation for any reason One more big huff and they start to get up And leave their cups on the table as they stiffly walk out and flounce out the door I justI dont get people Seriously You came into a very crowded very public shop but somehow deigned that your conversation was so deep and dark and mysterious that you literally needed to go through a closed door into a dark room and have your talk thereand then youre gonna act surprised when we noticeReddit customers make me crazy A lot TLDR I interrupted a dark and secret meeting The Devil and her minion did not approve ,Ugh I know Ive paid for it before,558

sinspider,35,114,1hd8fs,455,More tales from the comic shop This one in particular has stuck with me very clearly over the years and frankly is one im sure that most people in retail that have stores that hold stock can relate to TlDR at bottomIn my last year at the store we were taken over by new owners again and frankly they were rather nice South african family who were straight shooters and albeit did things differently were still great to work for They allowed all of us in our respective roles to have more responsibility I became known as the Comic book nazi see Seinfields soup nazi for dealing with people that others were afraid to such as the person in this story Our store meant that your could preorder figurines before they were made  months in advance with a deposit and the customer would know the date the figures would come into the store and had  months to pay and pick it up due to us calling them andor letter amazing amount of time in my opinion  It should be noted that even with a small store markup most of these figures were minimum  if not over  for the epic collectors pieces I started going through a lot of these orders and discovered that a number of customers had been taking advantage of these extended collection period and would not pay for andor pick things up for  months or greater More when they felt they had the spare money which had lead to the back of our shop overflowing with boxes It was honestly silly to the point of where we had no where to put our own bags in the back of the shop due to there being no room I took it upon myself to start chasing a lot of these people up to collect their shit or at least start making consistent payments on it instead of just the minimum deposit and if they didnt it would be put on sale for another customer For the most part customers were appreciative Many had forgotten they had ordered it or were embarrassed to have been taken advantage for so long which cleared a lot of space in a short time Some were a bit more aggressive until i explained things to them eg sinspider most places will only hold orders for a week or less and youve had this in storage for  months with no additional money paid etc and if i had not called you likely would have forgotten about it at all so at least we had the courtesy to call youcustomerill be in this afternoonAnyway this particular customer has never left my mind lets call her FM for fucking mole This was a person who believed anyone else especially retail was beneath her Which was ironic because she was a militant feminist bogan which waswell she was the first i had encountered in my life FM had been a customer since the store had opened but for rarer hard to find items and upon checking how long her orders were sitting out the back some had been sitting out there for as long as  months This woman was also one whom knew when our busiest periods of the month were but would still call up and keep one of the staff on the phone for half an hour or more looking for specific issues of specific comics and then drive straight to the store expecting that they would all be waiting for her in the  minutes it took her to get there She did this to me twice FM I want all these things list as long as my forearmSinspider sure thing but you understand most of these comics have not been in print for many months even years I will do what i can to find these for you and put them aside for you Just be aware the new catalogs are out and we are very busy at the moment so they might not be aside until tomorrowFM sure thing thanksfast forward minutesFM at counter behind other customer loud sighFM reaching counter exasperated sigh so have you put everything aside for meSinspider umi told you on the phone that we were extremely busy and i have not left this counter since you rang me Id be happy to go looking for you and see what i can find but it may take some timeFM so gocontaining rage jump ahead  minsI have found maybe half the list after neglecting every other customer in a very busy period to help FM and the rest we simply dont have in stock from over  comics and cannot order in FM lets out a loud sigh every time i dont walk up to her with the counter with her entire order enough that the whole store could hear I explain this to her but instead of thanks she begins to complain about the service We are not helping her We are not looking after one of our best customers cough and so on No thanks for the thousands of comics i searched through to find her the crap she wanted to begin with Anyway i digress i was just setting up the type of personality this FM is Back to the  month old orders It turns out she was coming in and picking up the must have pieces every  months still way over what we allowed and leaving other pieces behind I called her up and the conversation followed as thusSinspider Hi FM im sinspider from comic store and im just calling to let you know that it has been   months since you have made any form of payment on x items and many others If you dont come in to collect your items in the next  days they will be put back on the shelfFM abuse and more abuse and then some occasional words I paid for a deposit and i continue to order from you guys you have no right those are legally mine i will take you to court if you try and take them from meSinspider True you paid a deposit for them but you have not paid any further amount since then being well over a year and we very rarely see you in the store Our policy is to hold stock for only  months and you have clearly exceeded thisFM abuse followed by your doing this because im a woman Sinspider FM i have just told you exactly what our policy is and you can take it from me and my bosses that no longer are any freeloaders taking advantage of our policies anymore FM FUCK YOUhangs upI thought i was going to be in trouble from the newer owners for how i handled the call Instead they were happy for me dealing with her for taking up an entire shelf with items that werent profitable I find out later that she came in the next day Picked up the cheapest figure that she had  and abused the staff again and continued to do so after purchase I arrived on my shift to see this abuse carrying on Not knowing who she was told her to GFTO of the store and not come back and she recognized my voice She leaves the store and doesnt meet my gaze and we dont hear from her again  Her crap gets put back out for sale and all sold within the next week earning the owners some  from her deposits that were nullified and some of her figures were worth even more netting them  total And thus earning me my new title of Comic book nazi I wore it proudly and no regular customer ever fucked with me again for fear of loosing their stuff TLDR bitch feels entitled and her collectors shit gets sold to someone else,Generosity is not all its cracked up to be,569

meguriau,39,134,1p961l,451,Hey TFR Ive been intending to make a post but struggled with wording until I came across an askreddit post and submitted my first story as a comment Im in the middle of procrastinating from my thesis at the moment so this first one will be almost a direct copypaste with modifications Background Two years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by If theres any interest Ill try to make it a point to post a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeThis first story is from the early months of this year It was my first summer working for the brand and the thermometer had not dipped under  degrees Celcius for several days at that point My manager and I were working an incredibly busy shift when the motion sensor sounded In came a local girl noticeably overweight disheveled hair belly exposed from illfitting sporting attire racquet bag over her shoulder and large quantities of chocolate smeared around the edges of her mouth Without any warning or acknowledgement of any sort she began pulling hats from almost every shelf making it a point to try on the most expensive hats possible In a most meticulous fashion she went about smearing sweat and ice cream on the linen and organza hats brushing felt hats against the direction of the nap of the fur and jamming them back onto the hat block amongst other travesties in the process Upon completing the first of her objectives she made a rude remark about the brand with regard to some of the products then skipped off on her merry wayA few hours later while my boss was on her lunch break the same girl returned As it turned out after everything she had done she still had the audacity to leave us her resume I gave my boss the satisfaction of putting it through the shredder,Please excuse my behaviour from earlier heres my resume Tales from a Hat Boutique,585
will,145,108,1i2dz3,449,I dont even know where to beginI work at a gas station here in Canada Its a self serve station so customers have to pump their gas themselves but in my province you have to pay for your gas before you pump Most customers I deal with are okay with this because this law has been in effect since  but there is the occasional customer from neighbouring provinces and the US of A that come in and make a big deal about the fact we are asking them to prepay for their gasA little back story the law was created when a gas station attendant stepped out in front of a car that tried to steal  in gas trying to stop him The driver hit him and he was dragged under that car for several kilometres until he diedSo Im having a pretty good day at work it wasnt a slow day but there were  of us there but there is only one till at our store I was on cash and my coworker was reading the paperThen an older guy comes in yelling at us about how the pumps not working I tell him there seems to be nothing wrong a message pops up on the till if there are any problems and that we can complete the transaction here inside if he likes He then starts swearing at me saying that he hasnt even pumped his gas yet I then see his licence plate hes from the wonderful province next to us that doesnt have this lawI calmly explain to him that in our province you have to pay for your gas before you pump it its not just you everyone has to do it and that its been the law since  Me Theres no way I can turn your pump on until you pay for your gasDouche Bag I just filled up at gas station up the street and they didnt ask for me to pay firstyoud think he wouldnt need gas if he just filled upMe Its the law for everyone sirThe old man is clearly frustrated and mad by this point and there are a few people waiting in line behind him now This is when my coworker chimes inCoworker Sir the law was put in place because a young man working at a gas station inThe old guy cuts him offDouche Bag I know the whole fuckin story Its just stupid that we should suffer because of some dead kidEveryone in line behind him looks at him Coworker That kid lost his life This law is helping save lives fromDouche Bag It was stupid of that kid to step out in front of that car He would have been alive and none of us would have any trouble getting our fuckin gas if he wasnt such a fuckin idiotBy this point we are allowed to kick him out of the store for causing a disturbance and if he doesnt we can call the policeMe Back then he was responsible for any gas not paid forCoworker That  would come out of his pay cheque and he would be fired Im sorry sir but your going to have to leaveDouche Bag What the fuck is this You cant kick me out Just turn on my god damn pumpMe If you dont leave now I have to call the policeDouche Bag This is bullshit Im going to other gas station up the street You just lost a customerThe old guy stormed out of the store and back to his car and drove off forgetting to close his gas capThis is the first time a customer has really gotten to me I already get the occasional immigrants stealing out jobs because Im half MiddleEastern born in Canada by the way but just the fact he didnt give a shit that someone like him killed a young guy because they didnt want to follow the rules really made me mad Both me and my coworker were really mad for the rest of our shift thankfully the rest of the customers today were generally nice,A customer came in today complaining he has to suffer because of some dead kid,557

crickey,39,151,1keyxl,445,Third post here I hope you guys are enjoying my stories so farA little background to this story We just got a new part timer in our department and even though shes been here about two weeks yesterday was the first time Ive met her She witnessed this whole thing go down and hopefully she doesnt think this happens oftenYesterday at the shoe department it was pretty bonkers tons of clearance going on so I had a lot of customers wanting shoes and I was by myself until  minutes before my shift ended New girl who Ill call NG from here had just gotten in but I was helping a customer so I hadnt really gotten to chat After I left the customer a teenage girl I go talk to NG Halfway through finally introducing myself we see this kid bolting down the front center aisle of the accessories department yelling I didnt steal nothing followed by our two LP officers charging after him at full speed The kid was carrying a backpack full of Polo shirts and dropped it while he was running After they turn the corner me and NG and another customer start chatting about what happened A few seconds later a couple other kids one carrying a Victorias Secret bagan important detail cut through our department heading toward the direction the other kid was running I saw in my most threatening authoritative voice Are you with the kid who just ran by here They denied it acting like I was crazy but I knew full well they were I cant do anything to them so I let them goA couple minutes later the teenage girl I was helping before the incident comes up to me and tells me that one of the two kids who walked by stole her Victorias Secret bag At this point I see them walk toward the front exit so I follow after them Now as most of you fellow retailers know you just cant tackle someone on probable cause or at all unfortunately so I follow closely behind I call out to them but the keep walking Once they leave the store I cant follow anymore so I turn around and go back to my department I feel like a jerk at this point for letting them get away and tell the teenager Ill have to get a hold of security about itThe LP officers come around to accessories a couple seconds later huffing and puffing and I tell them what happened They go talk to the girl and mall security gets involved All the while Im standing there like an idiot because I let some kids get away with theft right under my noseLater after all the info is taken about the incident the teenager and her mother return to the shoe department and I apologize a million times They say its ok it was only a couple of tshirts I tell them that the girl who stole the shirts is probably going to be disappointed because shes a little too fat to be wearing size small shirts They laughed and thanked me and though I still feel a little guilty I think I made their day a tiny bit betterSo within the first  minutes of meeting me NG got to watch an attempted robbery and a definite robbery I told her after all was said and done that things like that dont happen too often She seemed like she enjoyed the specticle and hopefully she likes me and working in the shoe department,That girl just stole my bag,596

,91,68,wro09,446,Greetings fellow retailers Ive got quite the story for all of you Indulge me for a moment if you have the timeI work at a homedecofabric store In my department fabrics we have  rows of shelves to display the fabrics we have for sale The first row is for the clearancediscount fabrics that we need to get rid of the other  are for the regular priced items Atop the large discount shelf sits a large sign that reads CLEARANCE FABRICS  DOLLARS PER METER All prices are as marked Every now and then some inconsiderate moron will take a bolt of the most expensive fabric we have usually raw silk or velvet which is on the opposite fucking end of the department ogle at it for a little maybe let hisher kids bite and piss on it take it on a little stroll throughout the store and leave it unrolled of course on the bargain shelf This is a story of what happens to naughty boys and girls that dont read the price tags and signs in storesThis happened about a week ago Dialogue is recreated from memory Most of it is correct Enter stage left Mrs Illiterate McFuckface and husband Stubborn von Butterballs Fuckface decides to browse our rather large selection of upholstery and dress fabrics deciding that it needs to make a new dress or whatever the voices in hear head tell her to make It lays its eyes on the bolt of velvet deciding that its going to need a few meters of velvet for its next creation Lo and behold The sleek smooth highquality elegantlooking crimson bolt of velvet gives off a soft warm radiance even under the cold unforgiving fluorescent ceilinglight Like a diamond in the rough its untidily perched next to the dirty stained torn dustyold bolt of bleached cotton Quite a contrast some might noticeDiscount shelfVelvetVelvet on discount shelfAfter expending its mana reserves the Fuckface has put two and two together It has deduced that because the velvet on the discount shelf it must obviously be on sale To hell with the price tag that clearly says its  per meter its on the discount shelf This must be her lucky day Perhaps the stars have aligned and have given her the big break she needsIt commands its broodmate Stubborn von Butterballs to transport the material for her as she is obviously too important for such simple tasks Without hesitation the drone uses its grubby little arms to carry the bolt of velvet to the paymentcutting counter As it lays the bolt on the counter Fuckface says with a silver of triumph in its voice I want five meters of thisLike all the other good employees I process her request scan her fabric and total up her purchasegtThatll be two hundred and fifty dollars maam I say with a semiforced smile on my facegtNo Youve scanned it wrong this was on the discount shelf it repliesgtNo madam that was incorrectly placed I can see why youd mistake this for a discounted item but still it clearly indicates on the price tag that its  dollars per meter Im sorry this happens every now and then Id be happy to give you  off for your trouble if youd likeUnable to process the information given the Fuckface replies No this isnt two hundred dollars it was on the discount shelfgtMadam the sign on the shelf states that all prices are as marked Even if this was on sale Id still have to charge you according to the price tag If you dont want to pay for this we have some similar materials that are a little cheaper gtTHE DISCOUNT SHELF SIGN SAYS FABRICS THERE ARE TWO TO TEN DOLLARS PER METER I WANT THIS AND IM NOT FUCKING PAYING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THIS It replies confused and infuriatedgtThe sign also says that prices are as markedConfused irritated and unsure of what to do next the Fuckface musters up the energy to follow whatever instruction its simple brain tells it to doFuckface used Mating CallIt wails for its significant other to come to its aid till suddenly a wild Stubborn von Butterballs appearsgtTHIS FABRIC WAS ON THE DISCOUNT SHELF THIS BOY WONT SELL IT TO ME FOR CHEAP it screams to its partnerObviously enraged by this the musclebound oaf storms towards the countergtWHERES YOUR MANAGER I WANT TO SEE HIM NOWgtIll call him right away Ill be right back sir I reply with a smug grin on my faceI scurry to the intercom like a child on Christmas morning and page for my manager to come Like a knight in shining armor my manager arrives to the rescue Theres already quite a wall of text here so Ill spare you the repeat conversation that occuredBack and forth like three warriors in a heated battle the angry couple relentlessly spammed It Was On The Discount Shelf while my manager replied with the supereffectve Read The Sign occasionally reenforcing our defences with Sorry We Can Still Give You A Discount By this point a small crowd of people had paused their adventure in the mall to watch the bloody battle Some of them even tried defending us but for all their efforts all they got was an angry SHUT THE FUCK UP STAY OUT OF THIS by the savages Things finally came to a close when my manager had to drop the nuke and call securityAfter about four minutes of verbal pingpong my manager paged for mall security Three burly intimidating security guards arrived to escort the Neanderthals out of the store Instead of thanking their escorts all  they received were a bunch of barely comprehensible death and lawsuit threatsThe crowd of people started applauding and cheering as Fuckface and its drone walked out of the store sulking in defeat Its final words were IM GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THIS FUCKING STORE JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE YOULL ALL BE FUCKING JOBLESS WHEN IM DONE WITH YOU Eyes were rolled and groans were groaned when out of nowhere a teenage boy yelled just out of earshot THE PRICE TAGS ARE THERE FOR A FUCKING REASON LADYAll in all the battle was won and the fight was over The crowd my manager and myself all retreated into the staff room to revel in mead and song and we all lived happily ever afterHooly shit Glad I got that out of me If youve managed to read this far thanks and good on you My thoughts and wellwishes go out to anyone that has had to deal with customers like theseAnyways TLDR  Expensive item misplaced on discount shelf Lady didnt read the price tags and sign Hilarity ensuesNonstory version Why Why cant people just read the fucking price tagsedited for clarity,Rant The price tags are there for a fucking reason lady,514
crystall,107,90,1pk83x,441,I was reminded of this story of my time working at a certain international coffee shop chain by another post This was actually my comment to their post but I have been lurking here so long now commenting occasionally that I thought I would share this with you all Working the same shift in a downtown area of a city you see the same people at the same time every day You get to know what your regulars order this makes sense yes If we were slow and I saw a regular headed toward our doors I would start on their beverage so that by the time they paid it would be ready and waiting for them Most people appreciated this they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didnt have to stand around waitingwasting their break time Most people This one guy came in at pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same nonfat vanilla latte EVERY DAY I see him coming down the block there are no customers I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush I stop what I am doing and start making his drink so that just as my coworker handed him his change I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him saying heres your nonfat vanilla latte sir He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him gave me a death look and said what is this I repeated what I said maintaining eye contact When did you make this he asked incredulously Just now I stated I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you I smiled he was still giving me the death look He picks up the cup sniffs it glares at me and walks out Later on that day my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr nonfat vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well Nothing ever came of it But every afternoon after that at pm I would wait patiently until he ordered until he paid then I would painstakingly make his drink taking as much time as possible and hand it off to him with a smile Some people just dont appreciate it when people try to do nice things for them,Your Efficiency Offends my Delicate Sensibilities,531
Tanok,46,78,1cbn74,449,WARNING This is a positive story so it might not be your cup of teaI worked on a gas station and we just started using this new system where you had to pay before you could fill gas on your carThis particular day was nothing out of the ordinary That was untill this costumer showed up A middleaged woman that looked distressed I asked her what was up and she said that her car had run out of fuel and couldnt refill it Her credit card had been blocked and she had no cash She still had  km home so she really needed gas I tried my best to help her  asking my boss if we could release a pump and let her pay later  but there was nothing Unless of course I paid for her gas out of my own pocket I may be a bit naive and trusty but I really wanted to help her So I explained to her that I would pay for her gas myself and gave her my information so she could transfer the money to me when she got home It ended up being like  worth of gas Not a huge loss but still not something I feel comfortable with trusting to a total strangerShe thanked me profoundly and went on her way A few days later I checked my bank account and I had received a transfer of  with a note saying thanks Even though  is not huge or anything it has got to be the most heartwarming  dollars Ive earnedTLDR I paid for someones gas because she had no means to do it herself and got double the money in return as thanks,Sometimes kindness pays off,527

butwhyisititchy,49,91,1porcp,440,So not retail but a good customer story nonetheless I worked for a large national health insurance company for a few years doing customer service and in that time I spoke to a lot ofuh special people One day I got a call from a gentleman who was getting a bill from his doctor and wanted to know why we didnt pay it Well the doctor was not in our network so when that happens we give the customer the option of having payment sent directly to them instead of their doctor since they often have to pay up front for services I checked his claim and sure enough we had already paid him in full for this bill It was somewhere around  He said he had never received the check so I looked and it had been cashed a few months back I looked at the image of the cashed check and told him his signature was on it and it had been cashed I told him if he didnt cash it I could initiate a checkfraud investigation for him As usual though I was pretty certain he had cashed the check and just didnt remember This is the case  of time Finally he realized he did in fact cash that check He didnt know that it was intended to pay that bill though and had spent the money on other things Now I feel like I should mention that the checks are sent with a copy of the claim showing exactly what dates and services the check is for But surehe had no idea Thats fine Im thinking now that he realizes what happened this call is done and I can go home call came in  minutes before my shift was overlove that But no He then asked if I would be RESENDING a check for that amount to pay this bill What Um no sir we already paid for this You received the money Thats it for us Him well yes but I spent that money already and still have this bill to pay You need to pay this bill Youre my insurance company I was literally speechless for a moment Wtf kind of logic is this I was on the phone with him for an HOUR going back and forth trying to get through his head that this makes less than zero sense People boggle my mind sometimes Tldr dude thinks we should pay his claim twice because the first time we paid it he used the money on other shit,No we wont pay you twice because you spent the first check by accident,531
HammerfistPucconi,92,89,1j2bih,444,I worked in a thrift store in thenot so nice part of my city It was a really good job and I met some really great people However I also met some pretty awful people I will share one of the lesser cases with you hereFirst things first Im half Nicaraguan but I dont look it I didnt learn much Spanish as a child but whenever my dads family would visit I would practice I also took seven years of Spanish in school so I have a pretty solid handle on itBack to the storyIn the thrift store there were only usually two people working Upon closing one would take the drawers and count out the deposit while the other vacuumed straightened and swept On this particular night I was working with the manager so when we closed she took the drawer back and I started vacuuming The front of our store is floortoceiling windows and I can see a group of people approaching the door All Hispanic there was a man his wife their little daughter and an older woman I assume she was the grandmother for the sake of the storyI will say here that the worst feeling in the world is looking someone in the eye as they try and open a door Because then they look stupid and they know you know they look stupid and you know that they know and so on I hate thatSo I turn my back as they approach so I dont have to see them try and fail to enter But when I turn around theyve opened the door The fuckTurns out my manager thought I locked the door while I thought she locked it So Im tasked with the wonderful duty of telling these people they cant do the exact thing theyve just done Nobody likes being told they cant do the exact thing theyve just doneMe Oh my gosh Im sorry That door shouldve been locked Were actually closedDad OhokGrandma Que paso Whats upDad Este cabron no va a dejarnos entrar This bastard isnt gonna let us inAt this point I am excited I love when people dont know I can understand themMe Debes saber que hablo espanol You should know that I speak SpanishI grab the door that hes holding and slowly pull it closed locking it as loudly as I could He started to become visibly angry that I had the nerve to close the door in his face and then I saw as it all clicked in his head and he just kind of backed awayNot as bad as other stories Ive read but it was pretty funny to me and I thought you might enjoy itPardon my inability to add appropriate punctuation to the Spanish section White people amirite,You should know that I speak Spanish,533
obscurethestorm,22,104,1paeun,440,This is a story that happened in the beginning of September and I posted it on my facebook so Im just going to copypaste it from there For reference I work in a retail store where the blue light shines brightgtYesterday a woman came through my checkout with her two kids a teen girl and a boy who looked around  years old The boy ended new shoes and they thought they could get then buy one get them half off but one of the pairs they picked out wasnt included They checked out and the boy was sad because hed have to continue playing in his ratty shoes and saving the other for school gtWhen their receipt printed out they got a  family shoes with a purchase of  or more coupon They were so excited but then they realized that they couldnt spend  obviously The lady behind them had been waiting patiently for me to get them all check out and she saw the coupon She told the little boy to run back and get his shoes and she used the coupon in her purchase which ended up being like something and the mom gave her the money to finish covering the shoes  It was seriously the most heart warming thing ever gtWhen the family left the woman paid and said I just cant stand the thought of that little boy playing in those shoes any more My sons had to do that and I wish someone had helped us I wanted to give her like the worlds biggest hug It was awesomeThis is one of my favorite things to ever happen to me at work and I have yet to witness anything like it ever again It makes me happy to know that people actually act like people sometimes and look out for each other,People being actual people,544

nosetwitch,38,79,19pcur,437,I work in a grocery store deli that is big on our fried chicken We use large pressure fryers that have a long trough for collecting runoff water from the chicken While they do not have to be changed after every fry it is important to empty them before you start frying and afterwards to prevent them from overflowing on to the floor which makes a disgusting greasy messSo its Sunday afternoon and I am getting ready to start frying We have two fryers that differ slightly and I normally use the middle one I get everything set up for my first fry and go down to empty the water trough I barely move it before greasy nasty water comes pouring out of it over my hands For it to get this full means that no one has emptied it in days Once it gets this full it is impossible to empty it without making a huge mess Needless to say I was pissed This isnt the first time my lazy coworkers have left this mess for meI decided enough was enough I looked at our fry log sheet and see that that same coworker Moody has used that fry for the past four days I get out a pen and paper and make a nice big note and writeEmpty your water tray Dont just leave your mess for othersI stick it on the fridge slide the overflowing water tray back into the fryer and use the other one for my chicken that day it was not overflowing so I could actually empty itThe next day I go into work and notice my note had been taken down off the fridge I mention it to my coworker and she says that she never saw a note this morning and that Moody or the Manager must have taken it down I told her what my note said and what had happened the previous day She then tells me what had happened that morningWhen Moody and the Manager came in for the day they presumably read my note Moody then uses the same fryer that she had all the previous days Doesnt check the water trough which I had not emptied Fried her chicken and the water overflowed into huge mess all over the floor TLDR  What goes around comes around,Sometimes your coworkers are worse than the customers,516
dairyqueenlatifah,114,111,15ayyj,444,The amount of people that dont think about how rude it is to be on your phone in a store is seriously overwhelmingNormally when a customer walks into my shop I greet them and ask if they need help finding anything If someone on their phone comes in I just dont even acknowledge themToday I had a woman with her sister and  year old daughter I had already rung up the sisters transaction and she stepped up to purchase her item separately She only had one little shirt Just one item During this transaction of ONE item she decides that she just cannot wait to call her friend back about their plans for Sunday night She completely ignored my prompts the customer has to choose yes or no to donate for a charity before the computer system will let me ring out the purchase so I decided I wasnt going to talk to her anymore Just to save my own ass I said your total is  and just stared at her I stared right at her face for about a full minute while she was planning her dinner at Granite City with Julia and Max The younger girl tried to get her attention by saying the total to her but even that didnt work I could tell the younger girl was getting embarrassed so she apologized to me and tried to take the money out of the ladys hand to pay me This is when the dumb old bitch finally got the clue that it was time to pay She said to her friend hold on Apparently I  have to pay in a voice that was pretty clear she thought I was a total bitch for not helping her She looks down at the PIN pad and says my total is   and I say sure isSo at this point she knows Im going out of my way to be a bitch to her and she dumps her coin purse on my counter and expects me to pick  cents out of it No lady I dont think so So I continued to stare at her Right in her face for the entire duration of her phone call She got the hint and threw  cents and a  dollar bill at me so I threw her receipt in her bag purposely did not give her promotional coupons and shoved the bag at her without saying have a nice dayTLDR if youre going to be a cunt to me Im going to be a cunt right back If youre not calling  your phone call can wait ,Please continue to be offended that I refuse to help you while youre on your cellphone in my store ,555
Theneoalchemist,60,154,1nb4p0,443,A couple years ago I worked at a department store One of the main problems with the store I worked on was that the managers were mainly concerned with looking good to corporate and the way they would do that was by short staffing the store in order to keep costs down We had  departments and  sets of registers Each department was supposed to have  people to close the store and each set of registers was to have  person at close if it got busy register associates would call for help from the floor associates so at minimum we were supposed to have about  people on the sales floor when closing With the managers trying to lower cost an average night would consist of about  people Also the manager on duty store or assistant would usually spend the whole night in there office only coming out in order to criticize employees on how long they were taking to clean their areas not paying attention to us being half staffed as well as busySo on this one particular night I was on the registers for a closing shift Once again we were short staffed but it was particularly bad because the store was having a big sale Well I guess the assistant manager had plans for the night because she pulled the other cashier off the register and had them work on helping to clean the sales floor So I was the only one on register and eventually I had about  customers in my line Following protocol I called for backup  minutes later and with  customers waiting in my line I called for backup again It was at this point that my manager calls my phone from her office and says Look there is no backup your on your own deal with it and than she hung up she didnt like me that much lol It was at this point that I looked at the line full of angry people and said Hi everyone Im sorry for the wait as a way to compensate you for your time everyone currently in line will get  off their purchase We were only allowed to give  at most if customers didnt have a coupon and if we gave  we were supposed to have a really good reason In the end all the customers in line thanked me and I never got in trouble for it Im sure LP understood the situation and my assistant manager was to self involved to ever notice all the discounts I gave that night She was eventually transferred to one of our stores in the middle of no where ,There is no backup cashiers your on your own deal with it,597

pibbsman,31,71,14pzqv,434,So another story from my days in retail popped into my head this morning that I cant believe I havent shared as of yet In my days working at the big blue electronics retailer I worked in a couple different stores one being in a mall in a large college town in New England Other than the colleges the area was rather dumpy and we had a good amount of theft that happened in the store so for the most part the employees were rather vigilant I worked in a large appliance department next to the rest rooms and break area On Halloween one year the managers all decided for a morale boost to allow all the employees to come to work in costume for the day It was a fun time and there were some great costumes I had class before my shift so I didnt have time to get changed This comes in laterSo Im working my shift and as expected its pretty slow I see a few high school kids walking around shopping for cds with a bag from the mall and I notice one of the kids grab a cd nothing wrong with that and then the group starts walking towards the bathroom but only the one with the cd goes in and the other two stand outside the area I call our LP officer and follow him into the bathroomNow because the break room door is directly across from the mens door I pretend to be walking into the break room to fool the first two kids and then redirect to the bathroom Hes the only person in there with his feet pointed towards the toilet All I can hear is the distinct sound of the wrapper on the cd peeling off I look under the stall and it hits the floor So I stand in front of the stall door grab the top and pull myself up I see the back of the kid cd in hand As I hold myself up I say You know kid if you were trying to steal from us you could of at least pretended like you were going to take a crap He turns around bright red oblivious to the fact that he got caught red handed He comes out of the stall with all of the evidence in hand He then says to me Come on man I cant get caught again I respond with Again wrong answer So we walk out of the bathroom and weve got two managers and the LP supervisor waiting All in costume So I hand this kid over to Barbie a milk carton and a vampire to go into the LP office Before they move another one of the employees dressed as Captain America shield and all comes walking up asking if he can be of any assistance Needless to say it was an interesting day,You should at least pretend to take a crap ,505

toxlab,57,93,1o5u7h,432,I got a job in a hotel kitchen It was nice Very nice Good menu good equipment and a professional staff that had a chef and a sous on every shiftWe got to rockstar it too At the end of our shift we could drop and run and a cleaning crew would take care of sanitation and food storage It was a plum gig And then they sold the placeThey gave up the restaurant and the catering business to a grade A scumbag He faked credentials to get the contract and had nothing but bravado on his side The higherups in the restaurant were all company men so when the new guy came in they went elsewhere in the chain Within a week we are hemorrhaging workers The ships going down and everyone knows it The new chef lasts ten shifts before he cant take the insanity He starts hiding out and swilling brandy Within a month he is gone He had moved across country to feature his own menu in this place and the owner was so bad he would rather be unemployed in a strange city then deal with himAround this point Im pretty much there all the time The owner complains that I should be using my downtime to hire new employees and do training Since this is no where near my job description there is much back and forthI knew he was going to be trouble When I met him I stuck out my hand and said Hi Im toxlab He stares at my hand KhanOkay Mr Khan Is that your last nameKhanAllrighty then I ask one of the front of the house survivors if he caught the bosses full name Kahn His name is Kahn Kahn  No one knowsNow the place is imploding With no new menu the corporate menu from the hotel is being served Except the supplies are no longer coming in No wholesaler will give this guy credit Hes bringing in product in dribs and drabs and he gets the absolute lowest priced everything We take a filet off the menu because the meat he purchased was so bad it looked like dogfood He insisted that every ounce of scrap anything be utilized regardless of appearance and state of decayThe rooms in the hotel have a room service menu thats even older and contains things like pizza that require special prep and cant be just thrown together The free breakfast given to every guest is a huge lynchpin in his contract with the hotel and hes going out of state to get egg product that cooks from frozen to a spongy egg loaf because it saves him ten bucks a day over fresh eggs So now the place has become a cesspool of shit food and confusion A steady stream of new hires comes in and we consider it a success when someone makes it through a full shift Im the only one in the kitchen most days and have taken to living at the hotel so I can work am to am Oh but the fun has only just begun There were a lot of reservations booked People who had contracts with the hotel were now being served by Kahn Kahn Promises were made Menus finalized There were three of us available to set up a wedding reception I left the kitchen and rolled round tables down the incline so we could set them up Im cooking all the food as wellHey they chose to have key lime cheesecake Sounds delish Too bad all Kahn Kahn will buy is tiny plain servings No matter I make a key lime glaze to go on topOh the wedding party suddenly grew fifty percent and the pasta bar was flat after ten minutes No problem says Kahn Kahn Just make more Except we have no more pasta We have no more sauce We dont even have garlic for bread He goes to the cash and carry and buys the bare minimum To make sauce I have to extend it with ketchup One of my finest culinary moments watching that get eaten and nobody saying booAfter the catering came Easter brunch The hotel was known for it and we had four hundred on the booksBut were still bleeding staff and all the ordering is fried Vendors that give you equipment when you buy their product have begun picking stuff up Kanh Kahn bitches and moans and makes promises but everyone has had it with his not paying bills so byebye toaster byebye juice machine byebye waffle maker The day arrives and its a three man line to make a buffet for four hundred A leader has emerged in the front of the house but hes delusional He sells Kahn Kahn on the idea of avoiding waste by restocking the bar to order A pan empties out call it back to the kitchen they make a new one it goes back out I explain that this is a logistical nightmare but Kahn Kahn and his new buddy think this will save him a couple bucks A tray runs out We start a new one Meanwhile people who wanted item X are eating item Y When Y runs out people start seeing the gaps They want X and Y Now the hoarding starts Whole tray of bacon gone So long sausage Its clear that the buffet is being emptied and replaced piecemeal The bitching begins Not only is there no food the service from years past is gone The quality of the stuff available is clearly inferior Kahn Kahn goes from table to table I think he meant to reassure people but the guy has no interpersonal skills and is insulting people left and right He comes to yell at me and I chase him out with the fact that we are now out of bacon sausage and ham and there are several hours left in service I implore him to go to the cash and carry Thirty minutes later he returns with a shopping bag from the grocery store Inside it One pound bacon store brand One package Brown and Serve sausages One package English Bangers sausages I held up the bacon This is good Now I just need about a hundred more of these He is incensed He goes out front to escape the madness of the kitchen only to find mass walkouts and unpaid bills Everyone in the place is ready to shout at him He moves to the hotel lobby and has people trying to fight him He eventually gets in his car and takes offWhen the whole shameful thing was over the dining room was trashed The kitchen was worse When all the garbage started overflowing and there was no one to remove it paper and cardboard started piling up on the floor At the end we were nearly wading in it I lasted about another two months before I got torn into for throwing away rotten shrimp Kahn Kahn suggested I was throwing it away because I was going to eat it later Wanna know why Because White people stealYeah thatll be enough of that,Watch a Dream Turn Into a Nightmare,525

Boognish,39,71,1e568i,432,I work at a chain restaurant that serves fresh baked goods and specialty beverages as well as a broad range of sandwiches salads soups and pastas Our menu changes several times a year and our most recent seasonal menu started this past Tuesday Yesterday our district manager and her boss the regional manager came to visit our store I do prep in the back of house I portion our ingredients and prepare all of our fresh vegetables and fruit and pull and thaw frozen entrees to be prepared hot by line I do a lot of inventory control and assist my managers with counts and truck A little while after the DM and RM arrived my DM came to me with an email detailing some new information about times for shrimp which is our newest menu item I thanked her for the information and told her Boy do I have some questions for you She laughed and asked me what I needed I had four or five different questions about procedures for preparing the shrimp and myself the DM RM and my store manager had an active discussion about various shrimprelated topics Both the DM and RM called several people to ask them for answers After a little while my RM said to me Hey these are great questions Thank you I thanked her for talking with me and then naturally at eleven oclock in the morning the lunch rush from hell arose There were customers filling our lobby out into the foyer having to place togo orders because all of our tables were full We did the most profitable hour we have ever done I have been at my job for two years now doing prep for a year and a half and it was the first time in an extremely long time that I really felt like I was having to hustle I felt like I did a pretty good job making sure the line was stocked up and wasnt overly concerned about the corporate managers being in the store as I am always on top of my product qualityAfter about three hours things started to die down The DM and RM who had been helping out the entire time on the line and bakery came back and continued their inspection of the store After an hour or so my store manager called me into the office and shut the door behind me He told me that our RM was so impressed with me and the questions I had asked that she wanted to give me a raise I was floored I thanked him and went back to work A little while later after they left my store manager and I went outside to take a well earned break He told me that the RM asked him how much of a raise she should give me and he had asked them for and gotten a seventyfive cent raise for me This is absolutely huge The day before yesterday I was approved for an apartment I have never had a place strictly of my own before Ive only ever lived with my sister or people I was in a relationship with I was feeling pretty worried about my potential to afford this place by myself and so hearing this news out of the blue has alleviated much of my concern I am also just really proud of the fact that someone at my workplace recognized the hard work I do especially someone from the corporate end who is known for having high standards I really do take a lot of pride in my job even though it is not something I see myself doing forever Just wanted to tell you guys a happy story This is one of my favorite subs and it seems like so many of us deserve better TLDR Corporate managers come to visit my store on a record breaking day I ask them a few questions about shrimp and get a surprise raise,I work really hard and I actually care about my fast food retail job I was rewarded for it yesterday  Long,503

CrazyOverlord,71,110,1ntobm,432,I work in a pretty popular store We sell everything from pharmaceuticals to highend cosmetics We also carry a lot of grocery items You would think that by now people would understand that as part of a franchise our prices are set but alas some people still think that they can haggle with us for cheaper prices Here are some stories            One of the most popular items we carry are eggs These eggs are under one of our many store brands meaning that its a lot cheaper when compared to other brands Usually when on sale a dozen can go for a low as  This particular week the eggs happened to be that price As always someone was unsatisfied    As I was returned some items the shelves in our grocery aisle a man H for Haggler and his family approached me       H holds out a carton of eggs to me Some of these eggs are broken    Me Im so sorry I look over at the shelf and see that its fully stocked with cartons of eggs Maybe he was just informing me Did you want to grab another one     H Its broken  can I get a discount    Me Unfortunately we cant sell broken eggs  its health code violation    H He looks a little bit miffed But what are you going to with these eggs Ill buy them    Me Again I cant sell them to you  its not safe    H Ill buy ALL your broken cartons    Me SirI cant    H definitely upset at this point Is there anyone else I could talk to    Me sigh Let me get my manager    My manager comes in and reiterates exactly what I said H again brings up the fact that were losing money by scrapping these eggs but my manager informs him that we get reimbursed for the cartons containing broken eggs H seems to finally understand and my manager and I walk away    Literally less than two minutes later I go back into our grocery aisle to finish off my returns There is H this time asking a different person whether or not he could get a discount on cartons with broken eggs I stuck around to hear my coworker also turn down his offer    Needless to say he ended up having to pay the measly  per carton price        Our store also carries laptops and netbooks We dont have a very varied supply and most of our prices tend to be a little above that of our competitors we make up for it with our membership card  our point system is one of the best One of the netbooks we sell is pretty tiny and in all honesty not much to look at It retails for about  but since no one was buying it my manager lowered it to      That day we were having a special promotion We were bumping up the reward levels of our points system which meant customers were able to save even more than before Unfortunately this was also the day that Points Man PM decided to show up during my shift    PM always asks to check his points balance as soon as he gets in the store Usually this is no problem but the thing with PM is that he always insists that hes supposed to have more points than what shows up on screen Everysingletime he says EhhhIm supposed to have insert high number of points here  and everysingletime I have to give him the website to check his points balance and to see where his points went    I realize that our system screws up once in a while but Ive cashed out PM before and I always see him cashing out his points at the lowest level instead of waiting until theyre worth more After these transactions I always make it a point to explain to PM that since he used his points hes now back to a lower number I guess he has selective memory when it comes to these things    Anywaysso here comes PM and I instantly cringe Again we do the whole points balance dance and he insists that hes supposed to have more points For the next hour he strolls around the store and picks up some stuff I remember baby formula  he tends to buy a lot of it and maybe some diapers One of the other things he picks up is the  laptop    He pushes his cart up to my till and I ring him up When it comes to the laptop PM is really excited and goes on about how its such a good deal and hes been wanting to buy something like this for a while After I explain to him that its a clear out item PM winks at me smiling and asks if its possible for me to give him a better deal Uhhhno Like most people who try to pull this stunt once I turn him down he asks for the manager  Manager Whats the price of the laptop now  Me   Manager Whats the original price  Me   Manager Thats the best we can do     PM decided not to get the laptop only to ask for it a couple of weeks later I guess he was just waiting for it to go on further sale Unfortunately for him someone had already snatched it up          The same thing that happened with PM happened with another couple They wanted to buy a camera on clear out and tried to bargain for a cheaper price The camera was originally  and was on clear out for   My supervisor straightout told them no and explained that we were actually losing money by selling it at that price already Apparently that still wasnt good enough and the couple then asked for a manager to weigh in Again they were told no They didnt buy the camera        Tldr Although I am but a lowly cashier it doesnt make what I say any less valid,No you may NOT get a discount,542

Cubbenstein,41,62,1jjv9m,432,Having read so many horror stories here I wanted to share something which I hope someone enjoysAbout  years ago I found myself working in a department store after dropping out of high school in Australia It seemed a good buffer before figuring out how I was going to get into uniWhile working there I quickly learnt that were nasty customers but there were also nice customers I always enjoyed striking up conversation with the nice customers which helped the day pass faster One such nice customer was a woman in her mids who always came in with a smile but she never spoke back to me She was deafNevertheless I always made an effort to attempt conversation which meant I usually carried a small notepad and pen in my pocket so we could write notes and pass them back and forth I decided that if I had a chance to learn sign language I would take itEventually I left retail to finish my schooling and where I went TAFE offered a variety of subjects to study  including sign language I really enjoyed the class and it was a rewarding  months of studyFast forward  years to when I have a graduate degree and someone deaf walks through my office I excitedly introduce myself in sign Its enough to make a connection and exchange contact details so that I could continue to practice my signingThat office later closed down and shortly after I found myself working as a project manager in a deaf community services organisation The person I introduced myself to turned out to be a director in the organisation and when a new job was created my name came up as someone to recruitRetail can be hard unrewarding work but it spurred me on to learn another language Deaf communities in each city are small so it shouldnt be too long before I run into the woman from the store again and have a conversation without the use of my pad and pen,Retail made me learn a new language,494

Andrewj,75,101,1kdnjr,421,I worked at a larger midwestern grocery store for about  years For  years I worked in the customer service area I was about  at the time If anyone works in retail now avoid customer service areas at all costs At our store we did money wiring transactions lotto and some bills were able to be paid here A majority of the time we dealt with people who had forgotten coupons or we explained the weekly ad a little more clearly for people who didnt understand at first My story occurs with the latter and a special kind of assholeI had this guy come up saying he wasnt given the special discount for a certain type of ketchup The sale we had running was a list of items throughout the store that when you bought ten of them you received so much off of your order It was always easy to tell which items were on sale on the receipt because they were marked with an asterisk I always hated these sales The messed up thing was for specific items they were specific sizes or ounces This dick customer came up and said I didnt get my five dollars off Common complaint I check his receipt and notice his two ketchups are not the correct brand I let him know which brand is actually on sale and I would be more than happy to give him a rain check if we happen to be out of stock He gives me the look We all know that look This is our conversation CI dont use that fucking ketchup Medumbfounded Im sorry sir but that is the ketchup that is included in our saleCI dont give a damn I want THIS ketchup and I want it NOWCSir this ketchup is regular price if need be I can always get a manager to see if there is anything they can specifically do By this time I have a line of about  people There is a stocky woman in her mid s who I know by name Lets call her Sally Sally usually comes in to buy lotto tickets MiddayEvening Pick  Always the nicest customer I had Sally walked up midway through this conversation and is giving said jerk customer the dirtiest look CI dont need your manager I want YOU to quit being so god damn lazy and give me my  dollars backMeSir this isnt something I can just do I need management approvalCYou know what this is why people bring guns into places like thisMy jaw hit the ground I have never been threatened with a gun in my life I froze and didnt want to move Everyone around the customer serviceself checkout heard him say this and I thought of one quick retort Me Unfortunately I have to take that statement as a threat Now the police need to be involvedC obviously nervousIm leaving anyway since you wont do shit for meDickhead bolts for the door with Sally on his heels making a call to the policeSallyDONT THINK YOURE GETTING AWAY WITH THISSally was my savior that day She followed the guy out to his car and gave the police his licence plate number She stayed until the police came in to talk to me The store manager who was usually a jerk let me sit up stairs with Sally while we both talked to the police individually After the cops talked to the customer himself they ended up banning the guy from the store completely and I got to go home early They never found any evidence that he had a gun on him or if he even owned a gun Even telling this story now gives me chills I sincerely hope no one is ever threatened with a gun while workingEDIT formattingspellingEDIT  I didnt expect this many comments for my story but a lot of people said how great Sally was I did buy Sally about  worth of lotto scratch offs and paid for her daily pick s for a week I wish I could have done more but she refused me buying her a gift card or giving her cash for anything else I have since lost touch but she is a great person and I hope she continues to be blessed to this day ,This is why people bring guns into places like this,522

ryetheguy,99,99,16s3er,428,Technically not retail but it deals with moneyI deliver pizzas around town for a local pizza joint that starts with a D Ive been doing this for a few months now and Ive gotten to become familiar with some of the customers who ordered alot One of them was the mother of one of my old girlfriends in high school so I knew her quite well and she ordered probably twice a week while I was working not sure how often she ordered any other timeAnyways one time I showed up and she was short two dollars so She was very kind to me even in break up so I didnt mind returning the favor I told her it was fine Id cover it I went to the car and took  dollars out of my wallet and used it to pay up what she missed No big dealAnyways this happened again the next week She was short five dollars this time and once again I paid the difference This happened every time that I delivered to her house for about a month Id say And I probably didnt get every single one of her deliveries I figured it was just something that she did with me but I was wrongApparently she had begun doing this to other drivers too and when they refused to give her order to her she said well that nice boy Ryan lets me have my pizzas for half off As you can imagine this got me into quite a bit of trouble with management The next time I delivered to her place I told her what happened and how I didnt appreciate her taking advantage of me and the other drivers so she paid and I was on my way thinking that the problem was solvedI was off on the day after that but when I returned to work two days later I was fired Apparently she called back and told them that I had given her two extra pizzas than she ordered for free and she was calling because it hurt her conscience to know that she was taking advantage of the company As you can expect that was total bullshit and I didnt even give her the pizza she ordered for free nevermind two extras that wouldve belonged to other customers Heres the real kicker though My manager said that another female customer called in that same night and said that their pizza didnt arrive Its fishy but I get the feeling it was her daughter my ex and they were fucking with me but I like to think the best in peopleEither way I got fired over trying to be nice to an old acquaintance who took advantage of me Has this ever happened to anybody else,How being nice got me fired,527

winterstorm,51,90,16wxkq,427,Up until June of  all liquor in Washington State was sold in state run stores  We clerks were employees of the state and had to follow stict guidelines for all sales  For instance we could be fired if we sold alcohol to someone who appeared to be intoxicated  Also if one clerk refused a sale no other clerk was allowed to sell to that customer  SoOne day I was stocking shelves and my coworker lets call her Guadalupe was on the register  We were the only two clerks on the sales floor as our manager was a boob who rarely left the office even if there was trouble in the lobby  This meant that as the Senior Clerk I was in charge  I was just opening a case of tequila to stock when Guadalupe surreptitiously sidled up to me and in her thick Hispanic accent pointed out a customer at the back of the store  He seemed to be having trouble keeping his balance and was swaying back and forth as he studied the vodka section  Guadalupe told me that if he came up to her register she intended to refuse service as she suspected that he was drunk  I agreed and assured her that I would back her up if he became irate as inebriated customers often doSure enough the man tried to purchase some vodka and got very angry when he was refused service  I heard Guadalupe very patiently and politely explain that it was state policy and even point out the giant sign stating that we do not serve customers who appear to be intoxicated  He started screaming in a very heavy Russian accent that he wasnt an alcoholic and what kind of person did we think he was  So I went over to him and tried again to explain our policy  He would not listen and shouted at us that he was going to call the policeHe stomped out of the store nearly colliding with the doorframe pulled out his cell and made a call  He spent the next  or so minutes furiously pacing back and forth in front of our store untila policeman arrived  Guadalupe and I watched him yell at the policeman for a few minutes and then the policeman entered the store  He asked me if I had refused the sale and I replied that it was Guadalupe but that I absolutely agreed with her decision  The policeman looked surprised turned to Guadalupe and asked if it was true that she had refused the sale  She of course admitted that it was  The policeman started laughing  When he was done he informed us that the man had called in and reported us for discrimination  He said that we wouldnt sell to him because he was a foreigner  But after seeing the obvioulsy drunken man and hearing Guadalupes accent he concluded that this was a false allegation  The intoxicated man meanwhile was outside smirking very smugly at us through the window  Obviously he expected the policeman to reprimand us and demand that we sell him the vodka  He was very pleased with himselfThe policeman thanked us and went back outside to the waiting man and spoke to him  I dont know what he said but we could see the man visibly deflate more and more with each passing second  Then the policeman pointed away from the store obviously sending the man off  And on top of that he sat in his patrol car and made sure that he didnt get into a car and try to drive awayTLDR A drunken man called the cops when legally refused service at a liquor store  The cop sided with the clerks and made the guy walk home,The policeman was amused,517

cabeleirae,71,81,1kx4ey,420,When I was  I worked at a large big box pet food retail store that also sold aquarium fish small reptiles and rodents etc  This family used to come in all the time shopping for fish for their aquarium and they had a young adult severely autistic son who was unable to verbally communicate  They would take their time walking the aisles and viewing all the fish and their son seemed really calmed by it and found it very enjoyableWELLOne day the family came by wandered the aisles for a bit and then suddenly I saw the mom walk out the store  The autistic adult son was still there calmly viewing the fish and enjoying himself  Soon thereafter I saw his older brother leave and then it was just him  He wasnt causing any trouble at first and was minding his own business really until about  minutes passed and he realized that has family was gone  As I said before he was unable to verbally communicate so his communicating consisted of grunts and groans along with pointing and other physical movements  Im not sure what emotions he was experiencing but after another HOUR AND A HALF passed he began to get very upset and frustrated  He wanted us to bag some fish for him we refused because we knew he didnt have money and had no way of traveling home in time to get the fish in their aquarium before they died After about another  minutes of him getting increasingly frustrated he left the fish area and got a cart then began filling it with candy bars from the checkout line He dumped about every candy bar we had out into his cart hundreds and then waiting in line and then once he got to the front he began putting them on the counter  The cashier didnt really know how to handle it because again she knew he didnt have any money and he was loudly grunting and yelling at her and vigorously gesturing in a threatening way  The Manager on Duty that night was one of our assistant managers and she too was not sure of what to do  The cashier was calmly telling him that he couldnt buy the candy which got him more frustrated and he stormed away and began pulling some dog food bags off the shelves  As I said before he was in his late teensearly twenties about  and clearly very angry and frustrated  Luckily at this time it was about close and my manager said we would wait another  minutes for his family to come back before calling the police  After they didnt show we called the police and it took the police about another half hour to arrive  But of course just as the police showed up his mother and brother did She acted very worried and said things like Oh we didnt know where he went Were so glad he came here Of course this is the last place we looked Im so sorry officer we were so scared blah blah blah  WELL I witnessed the two of them knowingly leave him in the store  My manager politely told them that he could not be in our store anymore unsupervised because it was a disruption  They left in a huff still denying they had left him intentionallyWhile I am sure living with someone that has a disability is extremely difficult and that breaks are needed from time to time but seriously I couldnt believe that someone would abandoned their special needs family member in a store just to get away from them for awhile JesusThey came back a few weeks later and I saw the mom and him come in her lead him to the fish area then head for the door  I ran after her grabbed her and looked her straight in the eye and said You cannot leave him here That is wrong She stared at my yearold self silently for a moment before stuttering  I  I was just getting my wallet out of my car Then walked back in the store She scooped him up and they left together I didnt see them there again before I quit a few months laterTLDR woman leaves adult autistic son in our store for two hours to be babysat by the employees  Didnt come back until an hour after close denied having left him intentionallyEDITs formatting,I felt very sorry for this special needs kid and absolutely infuriated by his familys behavior,501

JacOfAllTrades,36,92,12bfie,413,About a year ago I had a gentleman in his thirties come into the store I started with the regular spiel and he said I need to furnish a whole house Uh yes sir His house was being built and was due to be finished in a few weeks making it the opportune time to buy our madetoorder furniture because it can take  weeks to get here but as I was selling he never really had an opinion on any of it just kept asking for mine Id push a little This or this and might get a response more than Which do you like but not by much It was really very odd Then I asked this question Do you have any other furniture to incorporate with the new He said No nothing I figured kicked outdivorced I didnt ask but he decided to explain My wife left meMe Oh Im sorryHim She had LupusMe Thats very unfortunateHere is where the story actually begins He goes on to explain to me that they had gotten married about ten years before and he worked in oil didnt look like a roughneck but I didnt ask and was away a lot so she spent the her time in school earning a bachelors and then a masters Shortly after she got her masters she was diagnosed with Lupus They put her on steroids as is the norm and everything seemed to be mostly okay except every time he talked to her she said the steroids made her fat and she had half a mind to stop taking them Hed tell her No take your meds and when he was home he always saw her taking them and she really didnt seem to be gaining too much weight so he didnt think anything more of it than that she was noticing her jeans getting a little tighter One day he got a call from his motherinlaw saying that his wife was unconscious in the hospital and her kidneys were in failure When he arrived they had her on IV steroids the failure had started to reverse and she apologized to everyone told them she hadnt been taking her meds because she didnt want to get fat said it wouldnt happen again and so on A couple weeks later he had to go back to work and she was doing well and back on oral steroids so it seemed life was back to normal Until she died She had gone back to live with her mother and apparently her husband was the only one who actually watched her take the pills so when he left she stopped and no one noticedThis is where is gets kinda crazyHer family blames him for her death and decides to sue They want everything of hers period doesnt matter if it was shared or not and want half the value of the house Judging from the way he told the story I believe they were harassing him and threatening to sue not that they actually did sue but I dont know any of that for sure So he packed up her personal belongings family pictures personal jewelry and other personal mementos in a box and mailed it to her mother and then donated the house and everything in it to charity including both cars He said that if they wanted to sue a church that was their business He bought a new car bought a new house that was in the process of being built and was set to leave it all behindNow Im sure you can all imagine that there is absolutely nothing that can come out of my mouth at this point other than Wow He looked me dead in the eyes and said And dont accuse me of being a heartless bastard because she left me for her pant size Yes sirAfter the story he was more receptive to picking out his stuff and he sure enough did buy an entire house of furniture Today I saw him at a local restaurant and I of course had not forgotten him but I was a little surprised when he waved at me and came over to the cash where I was He thanked me because when he walked into the store last year he felt like he killed his wife and when he started to tell me the story he realized it was her decision and her doing and he couldnt beat himself up over it forever He paid for my milkshake thanked me again and leftIt was a weird experience all around but I will definitely never forget that customer,The Customer I Will Never Forget,505
shaelynne,40,77,1pm7q8,416,Backstory I had been working for   years at a well known arts and crafts supply store I had been given a measly  cent raise over those   years My bosses reasoning Being a woman you cant lift as much as the guys can He was sexist and I was young and didnt know any better My actual job title was price integrity coordinator which meant I was responsible for price changes throughout the store But I also held keys opened and closed the store ran the front end ran a register stocked did receiving and on occasion even jumped into specialty departments like floral or framing Essentially I ran the store on  cents over minimum wage The day I quit It was in the midst of Black Friday chaos I had been working since am and it was now about am All  registers were rolling and the front end manager had pulled a no call no show I was the only one in the store at that time able to make change for tills and had thought all my price changes were fine and set before we left Wednesday night closed on ThanksgivingSo Im in the front office making cash drops and change for a few registers My manager comes storming in holding some papers Apparently sometime in the last  hours over the holiday corporate sent down some price changes for a small end cap of about  products Something that could wait until change was made and cash was dropped which I was almost done doing Leaving over  worth of cash in a drawer is not a good idea Also changing the prices would take no time after I was done my task I calmly explain to him that Im in midst of dropping thousands of dollars worth of cash and making some change for some cashiers NO That wasnt good enough for him He INSISTED I drop everything I was doing and change the prices I stayed calm he started getting angry and frustrated We went back and forth and I peered out the front office window at the long line of customers I turn back to him grab my store keys and toss them to him You can find someone else to run your store I quit And I walked out Clocked out collected my things and left All the while ignoring him following behind me begging me to stay begging me to help him get through the Black Friday madness He even promised me a  cent raise Oh boyNope I was gone Was able to get a job interview that Monday and had a new job a week later making much more than minimum wage,You can find someone else to run your store,493

batnuna,32,108,1hn3u5,416,Hey guys  So I work at a retail store in Israel where we sell computers smartphones etc  Ive been working there for a couple of years now and Ive had my share of abrasive customers Today however was the first time that Ive actually refused service to a customerOur stores are usually pretty busy We have a techsupport bar instore where people come to get help for their products   Usually they have a line of people waiting for service so every customer that buys anything in our stores is advised to schedule an appointment by phone or online before they arrive for support so they wont have to waitSo today this guy comes in I finish with a customer and offer my assistance Before I even get to ask what his name was he began to complain about how hes been waiting there for over  minutes though I saw him come in approximately  seconds earlier and how rude we are for not coming to help him immediatelyAfter about a minute of listening to him complain about the service he finally told me why he came in Turns out that his Apple TV has stopped working so he came in to get it looked at When I asked if he had set up an appointment he said no I havent Im here now so I expect service now and dont give me that face   What face I have no idea Thats my regular face Should I be insultedI told him that I noticed there were quite a few people waiting in line so he can either stay there and wait until every person with an appointment had been given service or I will gladly set him up with one for tomorrow or some other dayThat wasnt a smart thing to say apparently He was visibly angry saying that when he bought his device at one of our other stores they wasted my time for over an hour and youre wasting my time right now  I told him that Im sorry that he had a bad experience at the other store and that Im just trying to help He answered by saying so what are you waiting for So far all youve done is annoy meI was obviously quite stunned by that I began a sentence by saying something that roughly translates to listen man and he cut me off by saying Im not your friend Im not your brother so watch your mouthAt this point Ive had enough so I told him that if he wants he can go talk to someone else because Im not willing to continue this conversationI walked back to the office to get a drink of water and regain my composure My manager was there so I told him what happened knowing that hell probably need to face the guy in a few minutes Not  seconds later the guy steps into the office screaming that he demands to see the manager right nowAfter we got him to go outside my manager who is awesome told the guy that after the way he spoke to me it would be best if he would set up an appointment and come back another dayTLDR  Angry dude comes in the store to take out his frustrations on me manager backs me up in refusing to give him service,No YOU better watch your mouth,524
sxcamaro,104,75,1hzd8s,420, years of retail clothingsports have shown me the dark side of many customers I have helped From lazy to crazy I have seen some stuff in my timeToday I had an experience unlike any other A customer calls in to ask if we have various common items which we always stock The customer also asks if someone would help get the items I said sure not a problemAn hour later a middle aged man tall and in shape in a suit walks in grabs a folding chair and a shopping cart and sits at the front of the store When he is asked if he needs help he tells our cashier somebody needs to get these items for me because they told me they would Confused the cashier asks me to come to the front and help the customerWhen I asked the man if he needed help he became quite agitated and raised his voice Well how many times are you people going to ask me the same questions Just get the stuff so I can leave already I asked what he needed and was handed a stack of papers printed off the our online website probably  pages of items with sizescolors written next to the items and quantities I called my manager for help at this point and met him while gathering the items My manager found the situation odd and went to talk to the customer while  other associates rounded up the merchandise My manager came back agitated and told us to get the asshole out of here pronto he wouldnt say why but promised further explanation laterCheckout total was just south of a grand and the customer had two cards declined He blamed our cashier calling her an idiot and then thankfully the third card went through We then had to load the bags of merchandise into his car while he waitedAfter leaving our manager told us that the customer had informed him he could not walk around the store it was beneath him He said your people get paid to do this they can earn their keep today He had to walk away or he would have said some awful things to him and Im sure well receive a nasty complaint that corporate will harass us about ,Nightmare customer,495

CreatrixAnima,50,72,1ka1ip,408,I used to work in a little redneck town  Not very diverse but occasionally we would get contractors from out of town some of whom were Latino and didnt speak English  They would come in with coworkers who would translate for them so they could get lunch  I dont speak Spanish  I took Latin in school  but I always felt bad for these guys because their coworkers would go to get their drinks and chips and stuff and if I had any questions about their orders they wouldnt be able to answer me but they often looked sad or embarrassed about it  Usually my questions were related to toppings Lettuce tomato or onion or  Mayonnaise  So I learned to say those four words  I cant spell them but it was something like lechuga tomato yay  that one was easy saboyas and mayonaisa also easy  I probably butchered the language but I was able to communicate and these hungry hard working guys got their sandwiches the way they wanted them  And the cool thing was that they looked so happy and relieved when I was able to ask them directly if they wanted these things  I wish Id taken a language that people actually speak  Maybe some dayEdited to make  paragraphs,Four little words,480

CreatrixAnima,29,72,1httjx,414,Because our store could become very busy with people wanting deli items we tended to let only one employee wait on a customer rather than having  of us helping the same person  If there was only one customer the other employees would work on the other shift work  We also tended to talk while we worked  It isnt as though deli work demanded our utmost attention  You can slice a pound of ham and discuss things simultaneously without your work suffering rightSo on the day in question I was working with two other employees  One was waiting on a customer and I was talking with the other who was a  year old girl whose father was in the hospital and probably dying  It was not a frivolous conversation  Thats when the bitchy customer  a lady who was not obese but kind of big and probably pregnant  said You know Im in a hurry so maybe you could stop chatting and help me so I can get out of here  Had she asked nicely I would have helped her but I was angry that she thought her fucking deli meat  which she WAS getting  was more important than this little girl whose father was dying so bitchy employee  as in me  told her only one person could help her at a time  And then I proceeded to NOT help with her order  Afterwards I started to feel kind of bad and resolved to apologize when I saw her next  A few weeks went by before I saw her again  I went up to here in the aisle and said Hey I wanted to apologize to you about the last time you were here  The girl I was talking with was upset because her father was dying  Hes since passed awayThen something awesome happened  She said Oh I was kind of rude too  Im sorry  I had actually just begun labor and I was uncomfortable and cranky and wanted to go home  I had my baby later that nightSo we both laughed and were not bitches to each other anymore,The great bitchoff,486
skremnjava,73,86,1kt1dd,408,Hi all this is my first post here Ive really been enjoying reading these stories although some are really bloodboiling its unbelievable how people can act  Anyway Ive worked in retail jobs and food service for many years even worked as a manager for a few years and I have seen some shit in my time This story happened about a year ago when I was working in a winebeer store as a cashier WARNING This will be longThere were  of us working that day I was on register my manager was at the computer  feet away and the third guy was helping  customers pick out wine  The  customers were both black females and really young looking  When I am on register I pay attention to people in the store I notice who they come in with who is shopping with who and whatnot  I noticed that both of these girls were asking questions about wine both picking up and looking at bottles and thats fine because when you come to my register I am going to ask both of you for IDSo here they come they have selected  bottles of our finest  wines apparently it is for the older ones wedding that weekend  I ask for both IDs and I see the younger one look down at the floor Trouble brewing  I check the older girls ID and she has just turned  recently  I ask how old is she The older one says shes my  year old sister  From here on out the older girl will be referred to as BrideZilla BZ as the younger sister didnt say anything  I walked over to my manager who was  feet away to clear this sale with him since it was only slightly suspicious to me  You are not allowed to be in my store if you are under  unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian Brothers sisters boyfriends girlfriends and cousins are not legal guardians we get these types all the time  I was not going to refuse the sale to BZ I was just making sure I was in the clear with management  This action took approximately  secondsBefore my manager could say thats ok he was going to BZ throws a fit I dont need to put up with this  This is ridiculous I cant believe youre doing this to me Im not buying these I am taking my business elsewhere and I am NEVER coming back here again And she storms out the door with her young sister behind her  We were all shocked wow are you serious Even the manager was dumbfounded at how unnecessary that was  Just then the phone rings there is a truck delivery at the back door so the manager asks me to watch the front while he and the rd employee go receive the truck Sure no problem it was a slow day anyway I had some work that needed to get done and I had walked down an aisle to grab something where I could still see my register and people walking into the store from that vantage point  minutes later GUESS WHO COMES BACK they always come back dont they  This time she has someone else with her a black male that I assumed was her fiancee I never found out for sure  He will be referenced as Cool Fiancee CF because he was pretty coolEven though I am half way across the store I hear BZ say to CF that stupid white boy over there while pointing at me Oh hell no Hell no She didnt yell it but I heard it  So I start walking towards them its not like I could run away  I go up to the same computer my manager had been using and pretend like Im doing something  CF approaches me and calmly politely asks what has happened  BZ is running her mouth insult insult insult CF keeps telling her to stop stop go outside I got this  She is having none of it  I explain what happened that we dont allow minors in the store and that no one refused her sale that she had stormed off on her own BZ hears this and insults me more again and again CF keeps trying to get her to leave the store to stop running her mouth like thatCF looks at me and asks is there anything I can do  I was really impressed with him he did a great job keeping his cool  Just then a customer walks into the store with her  very small children  BZ starts yelling at this customer THEY CANT BE IN HERE THOSE KIDS CANT BE IN HERE I said to the woman Dont worry maam youre fine  BZ yells at me OH SO SHE CAN BRING HER KIDS IN HERE BUT NOT ME No you are not your sisters guardian Im sorryAnother customer came to my register to check out so I went over to ring them up  CF and BZ follow me of course  BZ is still running her mouth insulting me as I am checking this other customer out  Once again CF asks if there is anything he can do  I turn around look him in the eyes and I say OK I am going to sell the wine to you  I was really fed up at this point and just wanted them to leave  He thanks me and says he will be right back he needed to go get a wine corkscrew from the accessories aisle I say ok  So I was going to reward BZ for her terrible behavior she was going to get what she wantedDid she shut the fuck up and stop insulting me  Well this is Tales From Retail take you best guess  She KEEPS GOING calling me an idiot calling me racist  The woman with her  small kids are now at my register to pay for her wine  I turn back around to BZ and look at her and say Im sorry but youre going to have to step outside while he pays for this wine  BZ keeps it real IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU YOU AINT NO ONE NO ONE  All I can do is sigh Loudly  I yell out to CF Excuse me Sir Sir  He sees me I say Were done here  He doesnt say anything he knows its over he just walks back towards her looking shamed and completely embarrassed  I really felt bad for him I mean he was getting married to that creature As he was walking out I said sorry man he said its okThe woman with her  kids still at my register said that I absolutely did the right thing and thanked me for the good job I was doing  I mean how stupid do you have to be  Youre getting what you want and you cant shut your freaking mouth for  seconds  Furthermore if you say youre never coming back cant you make that a promise  CF ended up coming back later that night to buy the wine after I went home Oh well,That stupid white boy,494
hockeypuck,140,101,158ga3,411,After college I couldnt find a job so I started working as a waitress at a hour restaurant  I opted to work the midnight shift as it paid more and afforded me the opportunity for me to get more hours  Since my place of employment borders on a rather bad neighbourhood we have a security guard monitoring the premises all night long  On my shift we have two waitresses myself included a cook and the security guard on the premises  There is no manager or shift leader presentWe have a regular customer Lenny who is about  tall and weighs at least a solid  lbs that really really likes to hug female employees  He is also slightly mentally handicapped but is still functional enough to have obtained a commercial drivers license he is a trucker and live on his own  Most of the other waitresses allow him to hug them and get it out of his system  These being the same waitresses who sit on customers laps and flirt heavily for tips and see nothing wrong with staying with abusive or cheating boyfriends  Not exactly womens rights advocates here  I on the other hand really dont appreciate physical contact from strangers  My usual coworker Angela feels the same wayNow Lennys hugs are not your typical hugs  He only hugs women and also seems to enjoy fondling womens brastraps during the hug  He also forces these hugs on people grabbing them and pulling them in HARD if they dont reciprocate the hugAfter being taken aback and rather upset my first encounter and forced hug from Lenny I couldnt exactly yell at him to get the hell off me as that would probably have resulted in my being fired  I started resisting by standing behind the counter to take his order  He walked around it and hugged me anyway  I tried anticipating the hug and backing away quickly to no avail  Extending my hand for a handshake was equally fruitless  Planting my feet firmly on the ground to avoid being pulled in when he approached didnt work either  Im barely  lbs and rather petite so no matter what I did Id be physically overpowered and have my face smashed into Lennys smelly unwashed manboobs while he fondled my brastrap every time  Angela and I would trade off on who had to wait on him and neither of our strong nonverbal cues worked  Whoever wasnt waiting on him had to hide in the back because hed hug whatever females he sawA few weeks ago Angela had the night off and I was working with a male server who well call Bruce  Bruce knowing how I felt about Lenny and his hugs offered to wait on him in my stead  I was very grateful and started sweeping up the back to keep myself busy and out of Lennys sight  As soon as Bruce approached Lenny with the menu Lenny started yelling and cursing saying he didnt want Bruce waiting on him and demanding to know where I was  Bruce and the security guard managed to calm him down and Bruce waited on him anywayLater that day when Bruce and I told our boss what happened she said that she flatout didnt believe us that Lenny was just a big Teddy Bear and that she had never seen him act in a hostile manner toward anyone  She did not take our complaint seriously and pretty much thought we were lyingLenny came in again a few days later  i was off for the night and Angela was working with another girl  Lenny hugged the other girl first which made her extremely uncomfortable  When he went to hug Angela she stepped back quickly and said Please dont touch me  I dont like hugs  Lenny started screaming and yelling and made such a commotion that both the cook and the security guard approached and escorted him from the building  Apparently my boss was informed and had a talk with Lenny telling him that he must respect the personal space of others ask before hugging and keep his cool or he would not be allowed to returnFast forward to two nights ago  Its nearly am and Angela and I are almost finished with our shift  It has been a very slow night and the restaurant is peppered with a few mostly elderly coffeedrinkers who are quietly watching the weather report  Lenny lumbers in and stands near the counter  Aware of Angelas previous incident I volunteer to wait on him and approach him with a menu  He walks around the counter goes in to hug me and places his hand on my back  Being very careful to keep my tone and expression as pleasant as possible figuring that he reacted poorly to Angela due to her brusqueness I quietly say Please dont sirAnd thats when all Hell breaks looseLenny starts yelling and screaming and cursing  The only words I could make out were If you dont want to be friendly then I wont be fucking friendly  I can be REAL FUCKING MEAN  I take a few steps back toward the doorway leading to the server line  In a single bound he is practically nosetonose with me screaming at an unbelievable volume and making threats and flailing his arms about  He had clearly lost control and I was fairly shocked and terrified  Angela who had walked up behind me by this point grabs me by the elbow and yanks me through the doorway and out of sight  The cook RUNS out to get the security guard  Lenny continues his tirade until the security guard approaches and asks him to leave  I cant see what is happening at this point but I can hear Lenny start screaming even louder  I hear a few loud THUDS and peek out to make sure the security guard is okay  Lenny is throwing things and kicking things and knocking things over and having a violent tantrum near the front doors  The few other customers are looking on in silence wideeyed and too afraid to stop Lenny because of his massive size  The security guard having lost control of the situation tells Angela to call the police  She dials  and is explaining to the dispatcher what is going on when the shift leader for the next shift Liz walks in  Liz is a veteran waitress having worked at this particular restaurant for over a decade but is still shocked to see the commotion in the dining room  She asks me about it and I manage to blurt out that Lenny started raging when I asked him not to hug me  Liz apparently having balls of steel walks out into the dining room and approaches Lenny  I excuse myself outside at this point to get some airWhen I returned a few minutes later Lenny was sitting down at the counter chatting with Liz  I asked Angela what happened and she said that Liz invited Lenny to stay and eat allowing him to hug her in the process and assuring him that he wouldnt be denied any more hugswhich apparently calmed him down  Angela was FUMING  As she finishes telling me this a police officer approaches us  The officer in question is an almost nightly customer of ours whom we know rather well  As Angela explains the story to him Liz walks up and essentially tells the officer to go away and that nothing is wrong and shed gotten it under control  The cop sees the horrified looks on my and Angelas faces shakes his head and leaves  Liz then allowed Angela and me to hide in the back until Lenny left the premises fearing right along with us that he might snap again or lash out at one of us if we got too close  She told us to just let him hug us next time regardless of whether we want to to keep the guy happy  I was rather appalled by this response from a shiftleader but there was nothing I could do  When I spoke with my boss she said shed talk to Lenny againAs of today the situation has still not been handled I am still expected to submit myself to unwanted hugs and I am frantically looking for a new job  Sorry for the wall of text Im pretty pissed offTLDR Customer got so angry when I asked him not to hug me that he screamed threatened us and nearly destroyed the restaurant  I was told to allow him to hug me and he is still allowed in the restaurant,Apparently accepting unwanted physical contact and verbal assault are part of a waitresss job description,512
sneakerpimp,50,56,ybq7j,410,I had dinner at a restaurant a few nights ago  One of those chains that makes burgers steaks fish pasta etc  Nothing fancy but not fast food either  Anyway the waiter we had was fantastic  When I was asking him about the new additions to the menu and how spicy they were he was very helpful asked me a few questions about what I liked suggested something else that he thought I would like better and said he would make sure it wasnt made spicy I dont like spicy food  The food was absolutely delicious my mothers food was too he suggested that dish to her he was attentive polite and an allaround great server  I made sure to thank him and gave him a good tip  Now what made me feel kinda sad for servers was this  I saw the restaurant manager walk by our table while we were eating so I flagged her down  As soon as I said I wanted to say something about our server she got this terrified look on her face  When I was finished telling her how happy we were with his suggestions and his attentiveness she sighed and said Oh  Well thank you yes we do like him a lot here  I was just afraid you were going to say he was horrible or something because no one ever talks to me to say anything NICEI know most people dont talk to the manager about great service but still I found this really sad  ,People obviously dont make it a point to do this anymore,466
AboveanF,56,83,1k1cgs,411,I dont work in retail per say but I thought this would be the best place to post this  I have now worked in a public library a bit of time and I have seen some strange things  Background I am a female college student in my s and by far the youngest employee of the library  Usually I handle the computers the teen room and occasionally the textbook area  Here are some of the incidents I have encountered in my short time hereIDENTITY THIEFThis happened during my first month  I was working the circulation desk where people check out books and an older gentleman comes up to me  He says hello asks how I am doing and seems very pleasant  He then asks if I could look up a book for him about gardening  I ask for the name of the book and I find it in the system for him  It is unfortunately already checked out so I offer to place it on hold for him He agrees and I ask for his library card  He lets me know that he actually is new to the area and doesnt have one yet but would like to get one  No problem  I just need to see proof that he lives in the city limits  He pulls out a bill that has his name and address and I tell him I just need to see some ID preferably a license  This is when he goes ape shit  He yells I KNEW IT I KNEW THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO STEAL MY IDENTITY YOU AINT GETTING MY BRAIN YOULL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT I KNOW FOR YOURSELF He then pulls out little bits of paper from his pocket throws them in the air and runs out the door Never saw him againPRINT PLEASE THANK YOUAt this point I had moved to working at a different desk where I took care of people who needed to print things  A Chinese man comes up to my desk and holds out his flash drive and says Print please  I try to ask him exactly what he needs but soon realize that he doesnt speak English  I tell myself that I will try to help him as best as I can and take his flash drive  I open it up and of course none of the files are in English I ask him which file and show him the screen and he says Thank you Print please  Although more frustrated I decided to continuing helping  I opened up each file and each time he shook his head no until we reached the file he wanted  Keep in mind there were about  files on this flash drive  Eventually we made it to the paper he needed to print and it ended up being a signup sheet for a class to learn English  It had taken  minutes but when he saw his paper he beamed and said Please print thank youITS OKAY IM A TEENThis story wasnt that frustrating just kind of scary for meThe library has a teen room that they reserve only for teens  Others can go in and grab any book they want but the computers desks and couches in there are meant just for teens  They have that rule because more teens are likely to come if they have their own spot  Teens are anyone who is anyone between  years old One day a man goes and sits on one of the computers  It was incredibly obvious he wasnt a teen  I let him know the rules about the room and he says that he didnt know  I go back to my station   minutes later I look over and he is there again  Now this isnt someone who is bordering on maybe being a teen he is a big burly black man that was at least  years old  I let him know again that he cant be there and that there are computers elsewhere  He smiles at me with what teeth he has left and we have this dialogueMan Looking me up and down Its alright sweet thang Im a teenMe Sir its obvious that you arent Im going to have to ask you to use a computer elsewhere in the libraryMan I promise its okay Im a teen  It must be your girl hormones getting all worked up over how manly I lookAt this point he is trying to get near me and touch me so I exit the room and go to my desk  From my computer I shut down his account so he cant use that computer  He comes up to me fuming and says his computer is broken and that I have to fix it  He was getting too close to me  I told him that our system was fine and that that computer must be broken but he could try another computer if he wanted  Man Bitch I aint payin for your shit computer Fuck offAnd then he left the library  THATS NOT WHAT IM LOOKING FORI was now working the information desk where I helped people find a book they were looking for  A man comes in and mumbles a bit and asks me where the romance section was  I point him in the direction he thanks me and leaves  Another man then comes up and he starts asking for a book recommendation and we start chatting about various books  The other man then comes back pushes the person out of his way and looks at me angrilyMumbling man MM indiscernible mumblingMe Sir I didnt get that could you speak upMM THATS NOT WHAT IM LOOKING FOR  THE SECTION WAS THE WRONG ONE WHERE ARE YOUR GRAPHIC NOVELSAssuming he meant comics and such I sent him to the graphic novels section  I continue helping other patrons  About  minutes later he comes back angrierMM  indiscernible mumblingMe Sir could you repeat thatMM THATS NOT WHAT IM LOOKING FOR AHH THAT WAS WRONG TOO WHERE ARE YOUR MAGAZINESHe was yelling loudly but it is my job to help him so I pointed him to the magazines  At this point I was catching on to what he actually wanted and asked our security guard to stand near me in case he decided to get physical  The man comes back as expected and this time he is fumingMM THATS NOT WHAT IM LOOKING FOR WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ARE YOU A RETARDMe Sir if you would calm down and let me know what you are looking for I could helpMM FINE Im looking for your exotic sectionMe Ourexotic sectionMM Yes Your pornography Books magazines DVDs if you got emMe Sir this is a public library we have no pornography of any sortMM Oh You sureMe  positiveMM Oh I guess that makes sense  Thats alright Ill just find something else to readHe leaves and

baconpieguy,33,74,1i558k,404,Sorry for the big wall of text  Its my first time posting to TFR  Hope you like itI used to work in a music store  We sold all the usual good stuff Guitars drums horns DJ gear you get the picture For the most part we had pretty good customers  A nice blend of kids getting their first instruments home pickers seasoned pros  We even had a couple minorformer celebrity types that would come through on occasion  We also had our fair share of douchebags  Musicians right  Were a special breed  The one guy who sticks out most in my mind was a guy in his late s lets call him Don  Now Don was the sort of regular that all of the staff cringed at the sight of  He was short with a protruding beer gut draped with oversized rings and chains and drove a loud firebird complete with the giant emblem painted across the entire hood of the car  He was incredibly self important and would frequently butt into staff conversations with customers so he could give his very own opinions on whatever they were talking about  And he loved to name drop  Ive never seen someone drop so many names in a single conversationSo there we were one sunny afternoon and all was going well  In comes Don who immediately makes a bee line for our one guy who seems to indulgetolerate his usual hot air  Im at the counter as well restringing a guitar so I get to listen to our hero go on and on about his many conversations with Joe s Rockstar who is not only going to produce Dons new album but is going to bring Don in as a session player on his own new album  Restringing a guitar is pretty simple stuff so Im just taking my time with it as I listen to the hot air flowing to my right  A customer comes up from my left and I look up to see none other but Joe s himself  He was the type that had his  minutes back in the early s and then faded into general obscurity his One Big Song still getting a bit of radio play here and there  Hes local as regular a guy as can be and stops into the shop from time to time for a bit of gear or some fresh sets of strings  I greet him with the usual Hey Mr s  Hows things  That everything today etc and start ringing his purchase through  My colleague looks over with a grin and says Oh hey Joe  Don here was just telling me you guys have a couple big projects coming up together  Well Don turns to spot Joe and gets this huge deerinheadlights look in his eyes  Joe just takes a look at him and says Buddy I dont even know youDons response is to stammer for a second or two while turning beet red before making a hasty exitJoe for his part just finishes up his purchase and we talk a little shop about the new strings hes checking out then he heads out  I left that job shortly after so I never found out if Don ever came back or if there was any follow up to the incident  Still it felt really good to see a name dropper get called on his actions like thatTLDR Name dropper drops names gets busted by the person whose name hes dropping,Douche drops names,478
AmishHomeboy,83,94,1klgby,407,Whats up rTalesFromRetail Today I need to complain about an incident with my boss so WALL OF TEXT WARNINGso let me begin by saying I work rd shift  and a half hours without a break at a gas station When the end of my shift arrives Im tired ornery from dealing with customers and ready to go to bed Well first shift is normally the manager and assistant manager so they are the ones who relieve me from my shift The boss has showed up over an hour late more times than I can count but the most frustrating and irritating thing they do is after they both clock in and the assistant manager puts her till in the register and they ask me if I can watch it for a few minutes while they go smoke a cigarette So I always tell them yes which yes I know I should of learned by now and every single goddamn time they smoke like  to  cigarettes each and talk to each other Leaving me to watch the register for over a half hour every single time I just worked all night while they slept and they asked me to do them a favor and they take advantage of me Every Fucking Time Which inferiorities me to no end All the other coworkers who have asked me to watch their register while they go smoke are considerate and only smoke one and as fast as they can and if they see Im getting busy they will put it out and come inside to help me Not the manager and the assistant manager they go talk behind the dumpster and dont care if Im getting swamped by the morning rush or not and Ive never heard a thank you once Its ungrateful inconsiderate and unfair Now me being a nonsmoker working at night I have time to kill so I will occasionally enjoy a fresh air break for ten minutes or so a night especially if a customer I like is smoking outside Ill go have a chat with them Well we have this one regular customer whos about my age who comes in almost every night after he works and buys a tea and maybe a pack of smokes well call him Chris and everyone who works a late second and third know him very well because hes friendly and talks to everyone Well me and him hit it off really well and have conversations sometimes when he comes in One night he asked if I wanted to chat outside while he had a cigarette so I said yes While we were talking the assistant manager pulled up to get gas so I come inside and ring her up then go back out and continue talking to Chris We got carried away and talked a little longer then normal but it didnt stop me from getting my rd shift duties done so I didnt think anything of it The next morning the assistant manager comes in and asks to talk to me for a second Apparently after she filled up her tank she parked across the street and watched us talk for about  minutes and bitched me out for it saying I cant get anything done if all I do is talk and its my job to stop talking to the customers and not allow them to hang around the station So I was annoyed since she takes multiple smoke breaks all day and has left me to watch her register while she smokes for a fucking half hour almost every morning I work but I understand where she was coming from sorta The manager heard the talk and asks me if this is a customer she should have a talk with I tell her no and that Ill just tell him we cant talk as long as that again The next time Chris comes in I jokingly say hey You got me trouble and he says yeah I got myself in trouble which took me by surprise what do you meanApparently the manager took it upon herself to have that talk with Chris anyway in front of other customers who were in the store at the time She had a  to  minute talk with him about how it was wrong for him to distract me from my work and he needs to buy his stuff and just leave instead talking to her employees He was talked down to and humiliated by the manager of the gas station he frequents Im sorry but I find this wildly unprofessional I understand the reasons for my talk but she has no right to lecture a regular customer who spends his money here Chris emailed the corporate office to inform them of the situation and will be calling to file a complaint I havent heard the results of that yet Needless to say Ill have to get home as soon as possible when they ask me to watch the register while they smoke from now onEdit formatted got your pleasure,Manager lectures regular customer,501

tank When she finally got back outside she opened the door to the  car set it on her back seat and buckled it inThe other two ladies make their way to the car having not witnessed the rest of the

Inceptagon,93,102,1h8p1r,405,At my restaurant we recently added a taco salad to the menu Thing is this taco salad is not served with an edible shell like most restaurants serve them Its just the salad part I thought that was kind of an odd move but whatever I just work hereFor some people that might give away where I work but I dont care its necessary for the storyA few weeks ago I got a lady who came in huffing demanding a replacement order for an order we messed up She correctly names a manager she talked with on the phone and she has the receipt Okay so I honor it I look at the receipt and see that she had ordered a taco salad and nothing else I say to her Maam just out of curiosity what was the matter with the taco salad I just want to double check that we dont make the same mistake twiceShe says They didnt give me a taco salad I dont know what I got but it wasnt a taco saladImmediately I start thinking Oh god this better not be going where I think its goingSo I dutifully remake it exactly to specifications and I give it to her and apologize about whatever the problem was Internally Im crossing my fingers that the lady would accept it She doesntWhat is this This isnt a taco saladI cringe and say Maam thats our taco salad Thats exactly how we make themShe says No its not a taco salad Taco salads have shellsI try to say Maam the salad has seasoned taco beef on it and crunchy tortilla strips on topShe says No I ordered a taco salad you need to make me a taco salad I want one with a shellI apologize and say We cant make taco shells This company doesnt stock the tortillas we need to make themHer face turns red and she starts rambling Thats false advertizing Why do you advertize a taco salad if it doesnt have a shell Taco salads have shells thats what makes them taco salads Without the shell its not a taco saladIn one last attempt to be polite I pull out a menu for her and point out the picture clearly labeled TACO SALAD showing that it doesnt in fact come with an edible shell but a bowl It looks exactly like the one I made for her I show her that its exactly how we advertize itShe says This has to be a misprint That cant be rightI say What do you meanShe says like a broken record This picture isnt a taco salad It doesnt have a shellAt this point internally Im screaming GO TO Popular Mexican Restaurant you crazy woman but on the outside I restrain myself Instead I say Maam Im very sorry for the confusion but that is actually the way we serve our taco salads If you would like something else from our menu Id be happy to make it for youShe says So you cant make me a taco salad Is that what youre sayingI get the manager and walk away because Im fuming at her Manager says something to her and makes her leave Later we get a corporate complaint presumably from her that a customer got a taco salad made incorrectly without an edible shell and that we were rude and refused to make it correctly which puts a negative mark on our stores score But whatever if thats the price for never seeing her again then so be itSome of these people they give me funny stories to tell friends thats for sure I just need to keep telling myself that and maybe I wont end up pulling my hair outTLDR Taco salads do not automatically imply edible bowls no matter how hard you pretend Try a different restaurant,Lady Rejects Our Menu Substitutes Her Own,507
jadefirefly,35,48,19r2n6,408,I work in one of those discount stores  not exactly a dollar store though we do have lots of  items but stuff that isnt is still really cheap Its also a fairly lowincome town So needless to say my clientele doesnt always represent the cream of the crop Tonight I had an older man at my register and he didnt move about very well His cane was in the shopping cart and it was obvious that he wasnt going to get very far without support He didnt have a whole lot of stuff but it still wound up being two bags worth Now hed planned to cart it all to his car and return the cart like any reasonable person would do  but weve got such a theft problem carts included that the carts all have poles on them that prevent them from being taken out the door Theres normally a couple that dont in case someone really needs one but theyre missing Again Right behind him was a kid somewhere in the  range Hed obviously been sent on an errand all he had was two boxes of tissues Not to be judgemental but honestly he looked like the kind of kid I might have to watch in the store in a couple of years Saggy pants lopsided ball cap oversized hoodie As Im scanning his tissues through I explain to the old man that I can help him with his bags in just a moment as soon as Ive finished with the kid And before anyone else can say anything the kid steps up and says I can get your bags for you sir Sure as anything he gathers up that guys bags waits for him to get his cane all situated and walks him right out to his car I know something like that shouldnt move me that much But its just so damn rare around here to see kids display any real initiative to help others that my manager and I just stood there as they left shocked It made my day ,Faith in adolescents  temporarily restored,456
BAWWWWful,141,80,17ixnu,406,Today I present you with a familiar retail tale you know the type Corporate sets a policy management communicates that policy to the sales associate sales associate attempts to enforce policy spineless manager bends policy to avoid confrontation It makes you wonder why policies exist in the first place This tale is not as gross or shocking as some of the other stories about returns but it is one of the more memorable from my experience This occurred circa  when I worked in the Mens department of crappy department store Our stores return policy was more than fair if you ask me Most merchandise except for electronics could be returned with a receipt and we would return the amount paid for the item in the form that it was given If you had the receipt you could return merchandise in virtually any condition there were very few limitations on this If you had no receipt we could return the item for store credit so long as the SKU came up in our system and the item wasnt visibly worn We even accepted merchandise with no tags as long as it was something we currently carried and therefore could obtain a SKU and process the return Exchanges were allowed as long as the item was of equal value preferably the same brand and style You get the idea Often when customers found out that they could only get store credit without a receipt they would opt for an exchange One day a middleaged man approaches the register brandishing a visibly used Fossil belt with no tags I shall call him Belt Guy Belt Guy asks if he can return the belt Its me and two other employees working that day Michellenot her name and Lindsaysame deal Foreshadowing Michelle in particular is known for not taking shit from anyone and for regularly complaining that management makes the sales associates look bad by not backing them up on policy issues At that moment Michelle was elsewhere in the department straightening merchandise Lindsay and I were talking with Belt Guy at the register we explained the policy and stated that a belt in that condition was not returnable without a receipt Given that it was a Fossil belt we didnt even know whether he bought it from us to begin with We directed Belt Guy to the corner of the department where the belts and wallets lived so that he could buy himself a new friend Belt Guy returns about  minutes later carrying a brand new Fossil belt with tags If memory servers it wasnt even the same belt as the one he was attempting to exchange As he casually passes by the counter the following dialogue ensuesBelt Guy I put the other belt on the rack and I exchanged it for this one OKIll pause the dialogue for a moment so we can all take that in This customer thought it was totally normal to exchange take new merchandise without presenting his original merchandise and that he could just walk right out with it OK resume playHe starts towards the doorMe flabbergasted WhatLindsay Sir you cant do thatBelt Guy looking perplexed WhatLindsay We would have to actually process the exchange at the register we need a record of the transaction in our system Belt Guy But someone said I couldLindsay and I exchange looks knowing none of us would tell a customer they could do such a thingMe WhoBelt Guy It was a lady she had brown hairNote the description he gave seemed intentionally vague and the only one of us who could be described that way would be Michelle We knew she wouldnt approve something like thatIt was pretty clear to us what was going on here This guy knew he wasnt going to get his return through the proper channels because he had probably worn his old belt for years and knew we couldnt turn around and sell it to someone elseFortunately Michelle was just coming back to the register at that point perhaps seeing the commotion Belt Guy You points at Michelle You said I could just leave the other belt on the rack and take this oneMichelle WHAT No I didnt Belt Guy Yes you did I want to talk to a managerYou can imagine our joyfacetiousness upon hearing those awful words At crappy department store the procedure is to call customer service and request that a manager come to the department Whichever manager is available will head over So one of us makes the call while Michelle understandably continues arguing with the customer I would be angry too being accused of something that I know I didnt and would not ever doWe quietly groan among ourselves when we see who we won playing the manager lottery Its Nancystill with the madeup names  Nancy isnt your runofthemill spineless manager Oh no Nancy was much worse than that She had no business being in a management position She was the epitome of noncontfrontationalism a complete doormat Dont get me wrong she seemed like a nice enough lady and all but why take on a position of authority if youre incapable of telling people what to doNancy strolls up to the register already looking meek upon seeing all the commotion Michelle argues her case the customer argues his Lindsay and I chime in with bits of policy particularly underlining the reasonable notion that when you exchange merchandise you should ACTUALLY GIVE US THE MERCHANDISE This back and forth goes on for a while Nancy nervously glancing between the four of us until she just cant take it anymore She throws her arms up in consternationNancy Oh just let him take the beltAnd that was it She walks away The three of us are wearing our best are you fucking kidding me faces and the customer gleefully strides out of the store Thats right The fucker got away with it I dont remember if that was the last straw the one that broke my morale but I do know that not long after that the job became nothing but a paycheck to me I started to just cut out the damn middle man give the customers whatever they wanted and deal with the repercussions Spoiler alert there never were anytldr Why would we need to keep record of merchandise changing hands Inventory is just for fun right,Thats not how returns work Not here or anywhere else ,486

rambleson,34,81,1l1bxn,406,I was working at a coffee shop It was a slow day so only two of us were there My co worker was in the back doing dishes and I was cleaning up a table in the lobby Two teenagers walk in and go up to the counter and my coworker stops the dishes and ask what he can get them They ask for waters and as he turns around to get themI finish with  the tables and walk up to the counter As I walk up I see one of them reaching into our tip jar We had had a few incidents recently where people had grabbed our tip and run out So I stop walking and say in a loud voice is there a reason your hand is in my tip jar He turns and sees me and looks shocked at being caught He stammers out umm oh I was um putting change in I say  I highly doubt that my co worker at this point had turned around to see what was going on and sets the waters on the counter  I say I think you should take those waters and never come back They grab them and literally run out of the store My coworker was so blown away that I had caught them and confronted them For weeks he called me ballbuster and told my other co workers about how I saved our tips I never did see those two in the store again and our tips werent stolen while I was on the clock Ps I hate thieves,Is there a reason your hand is in my tip jar,487
tetewhyelle,71,120,18pc5k,400,Okay so Valentines Day was a really long day for me In fact it was the first time Id ever worked more than hrs in a day So expect this post to be long Im warning you now Its going to be a readI work in MakeAMonkey CreateACat BuildABulldog etc You get the idea As usual I will preface this by saying I LOVE my job Love love love my job Anyways on to my lovely Valentines Day It was busy The day before that Id prepared to be called in early My original shift had been close store closed at  usually finish cleaning around  However my ASM woke me up at around  and asked me to come in early No biggie In fact that awesome More hours and more money for me When I got there my ASM apoligized profusely for taking time away from Valentinesshe knows I live with my bf and thanks me for coming in It really wasnt a huge deal though My boyfriend and I had basically already decided that since we are so poor there is no sense is celebrating a moneyspending holiday like Vday As he said We dont need to spend scrupulous amounts of money on each other just to say I love you So basically Thursday is truck day One manager usually stays in the back to unpack the boxes and put all the shit away While  floor associates handle the floor Since it was going to be a busy day they had a floor associate and my GM working the floor while my ASM did truck The problem soon arose when they realized a newbie had been the scheduled floor associate So my GM was having to try to work on the new floor sets work register answer questions for guests and help put away any of the new stock that was supposed to go on the floor The problem had become worse when they realized that out of the remaining three people to come in I was the only one who wasnt a new hiresomebody really screwed the schedule upI ended up getting put in the hole to unload the boxes and put them either on the floor or top stock Which took a good hrs The whole time I was in the backroom I could hear it getting progressively busier but I did not expect to see what I saw when I went back on the floor It was literally worse than Christmas The store was trashed there was a line out the door and down the hallway and there was a steady crowd forming in front of register I hopped on register for a few hours until we go to a slow point then made a stock list I was about halfway done pulling everything when my managerI think I called her Kate in another story who had just took over floor after the ASM and GM left came to the back to tell me she needed me on the floor The store was swamped again and remained that way steadily until around  It didnt really slow down it just got to a point where nobody was waiting the be rung up and I could talk to my manager Kate for a second We had to send one of the new girls home because she had stayed min past her shift and we had to leave the other one on the stuff machine because thats all she had been trained on so far Kate and I made a game plan basically She told me what we needed to get done before the end of the night so I made myself Kate and the new girl all a todo list I felt bad for the new girl because she got all the shitty cleaning jobs but she was too inexperienced to know how to stock reset the floor set and box away the Vday stuff Tonight was definitely not the night to teach her either I got the lists handed out and then put the gate halfway down to discourage any more customers from coming in the store It was starting to slow down around  The lines were going down but it was  until close and we still hadnt even finished the midday stock started a close stock list or began to put out the new floor sets  minutes until close about  families ducked under the gate and started browsing I let everyone know the store was closing in minutes and got complaints from everyone that Well we thought you had later closing hours on Valentines Day You really ought to Its almost offensive that you dont Like what the fuck Okay dont wait until  at night to go shopping Dafuq people Then this one family They topped it all Theyd driven over an hour to our store because the one closer to them was closed for renovations That store sent out mailers and handed out flyers for MONTHS letting people know to come to our store instead and still people call us all like OH MY GOD Youre actually open Oh thank GOD Like every single one of our stores closed for renovations at the sameAnyways back to this family Theyd driven over an hour The wife was hearing impaired and talked in a way that made it very hard to understand Her husband had a thick African accent and they often switched between speaking English and their native languagewhich did not help for communication Their kidgrandkidnot sure which obviously did not even want to make a bear It was like they were talking him into it essentially Like for example I overheard this convo while they were looking at clothesDadgrandad  Hey didya see this outfit Its really coolKidgrandkid Yeah its alrightdadgrandad Well lets get it thenKid I dont knowDad well you said it was cool so why not get it Oh my God we are just getting thisKid FineI didnt even want to come here anywaysSo theyre making their frustrating way to register and then momgrandma suddenly remembers she must make three more stuffed animals for her daughtersgrandaughters But it cant just be any one stuffed animal Oh no she has to ask extensive questions about every single one of them Like which ones were most popular I tell her why And shes like No those are ugly Why would a girl want that I wanted to scream at her I DONT KNOW YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS POPULAR AND I TOLD YOU But of course I was polite and asked if there were any colors or animals the girls were interested inShe finally decides on our Vday themed animal Fine We make three of them Then she needs three matching Vday themed outfits Well our stock has dwindled and we only have a few things left She doesnt like what we have left and proceeds to spend another  minutes looking At this point they were the last people in the store and it is now  minutes after close I tell the new girl to start on her checklist because it was just cleaning stuff that could be done whether a customer was in the store or not She starts on that They finally get up the counter and I start to ring them up Of course she has to complain about pricing and ask the price of everything even though it tells her on our penpad Then she decides to remove something so I void the item from the transaction but its still telling her its there on the penpad She doesnt understand that its not a live update and doesnt refresh right awayShe has some coupons so I apply those and some point reward certificates Now These things basically count as cash Theyre usually like  and they run as a tender Like a  check from corporate to you So once I run it through theres no going back Even if I void the transaction itll take a call to corporate to get the certificate back So naturally what do you think she does Oh well she decides she does in fact want that item I voided and not just one but like an odd number like  or something Whatever I tell her itll have to be a seperate transaction She doesnt flip her shit or anything but shes obviously pissed and not having any of it Complaining and alikeFinally got her and her family out of the store atdrumroll please   minutes after close So Kate starts closing out the registers because she couldnt do it while the family was there I start pulling the Vday stuff to the back Since Kate was opening the next day she said she would box it up if I could just put out the new floor sets So I started on that Which took a good  minutes Then we realize we are missing some of our displays so I start on thatOh and the POS system pretty much crashed so Kate was on the phone with our DM for a while trying to sort that out Then she had to send our Vday numbers and other promotional offer info to the RM and all that other managery stuff The new girl kept cleaning and straighteningat a slow pace At around  I started making a stock listFINALLY I made seperate lists and took them to the back so Kate could pull them We got everything restocked decently Not perfect but at this point we were way past caring Sent the new girl home Finished  the new girls cleaning list and finally clocked out at  I worked a  hour shift that day Damn was I tired I then proceeded to work an hr shift the day after Vday and a another hr shift yesterday So in three days I racked up essentially hrs The pros  my store manager is asking the DM for the go ahead to give me manager trainingThe cons  I lost my voice from talking to customers so much Edit Grammar error,How I spent my Valentines Day and I why Ill be working the morning shift next

alltime highs the economy was in alltime lows the war was at an alltime crapfest and everyone in general was feeling an alltime slump  People werent happy with their lots in life  Where once people would ask to fill er up we were now getting small and odd denomination requests as it was obvious people were scraping the bottoms of their change jars just to afford to get to work  In short things werent that great  As Dickens said the worst of timesI had not yet been trained to be a cashier so my duties consisted only of being an attendant plus coming inside occasionally to help stock shelves or futz about in the cooler  Which is where I was when this particular little minidrama unfolded  A small truck pulled up and the driver asked to fill his tank with premium  NOT A CHEAP REQUEST  At the time premium was around gal and his truck had something like a  gallon tank that was just shy of emptyBut the alarming thing wasnt that the guy wanted to spend  on gas its that he was obviously methed out pretty hard  His pupils were so large it looked like he had no iris just twin wells of deep blackness  He was sweating hard even though it wasnt that warm he looked gaunt and thin his cheeks sunken and sallow  His movements were jerky and had a random aspect to them like the neurons in his somatosensory cortex had all gone on strike and the scabs they had hired to replace them really didnt understand the muscle movement user interface this should be a lesson always hire union workersAfter he had told the attendant that he was going to pay inside and grabbed his slip he proceeded to wander aimlessly up and down the aisles of our store looking at everything but seeing nothing  The cashier and the assistant manager soon became worried that this guy was going to splashanddash and this is where I realized that the crew at this station would be good to go when things got rough  Through very sneaky use of the intercom whispered instructions body language and general intuitiveness all three of the attendants the cashier the AM the GM and the three guys down at the car wash were all now surreptitiously watching this guy like a cast of hawks  However he was oblivious to our watchful eyes  Instead he picked up three liter bottles of Mt Dew placed them on the counter then blabbered semicoherently about needing the bathroom  The cashier pointed to the door near the backAt this point the AM the cashier and I had a hurried discussion  He was obviously out of his mind on something very strong he shouldnt be driving  Could we figure out a way to hold the guy there long enough for the cops to show up  The AM went into the back room to call it in while I stood watchThat last question thankfully answered itself  The guy came back out still dazed and confused but now walked straight past the counter and headed outside  I yelped into the backroom I think hes going to try and drive off as the AM was still talking with the dispatcher  His tone became more urgent as he now described the fact that this guy was about to make off with  worth of gas  Haste by the responding officers was promisedBut Lo  The gas station gods did smile upon us that day for it is written that this man could not get his truck started and he was wroth before their eyes  I dont know what it was that was wrong with his truck but he could not get it to start  The attendant came over and asked for the slip showing that he had paid but the driver just looked at him like he was a talking ficus or something and went back to trying to start the truck  The attendant then called inside on the intercom to ask if the guy had paid and get the conversation on the microphone  Nope no money had been receivedThe truck finally started but all the guy did was back up and park alongside the store  He sat in his car fiddling with something in the front seat as the rest of us waited with baited breath for the police to arriveWith their usually alacrity two units converged on our station with a timed precision that belied anything other than telepathy  They contacted the driver who seemed to be willing to go along with the program  That is until one of the cops reached out for him and like Usain Bolt coming off the blocks during the meter finals at the London  Olympics he was off like a shotA short foot chase ensued  Im sure that if this man had not ingested some sort of heavy narcotic he probably could have gotten away because he was quite fast  However being fast means nothing when you dont have good balance or coordination because he tripped and fell over himself about the time he got to the far end of the parking lot followed quickly by flying tackles that would make any Heisman winner proudCuffed and secured he was lead back up to the station to be patted down  And what would you know he had ZERO money on him  No cards no cash no checks no nuthin  So the officers charged him with theft and evasion and got him in one of their cars  They then searched his truck finding several small baggies of an oddlyfamiliar white substance  Well then add possession of meth to the list got to watch them do the test on the material its very cool and incredibly fast  The officers thanked us we highfived our selves several times and then went back to work secure in the knowledge that we had each others backs and that at least one bad guy was off the streetsPOST SCRIPT  The tale does not end there but continues on a few days and about  miles later  The guy made bail hitched a ride and was found south of the state capitol at a rest stop naked as Helen Mirren in Caligula but no where near as hot doing his level best to murder a park bench with a wooden stake  He was again arrested but not before AGAIN getting in a foot pursuit this time along the shoulder of the interstate  I would love to have seen the faces of passing motorists as they saw a naked guy with a large chunk of wood being chased by several cops up the shoulder of a freeway in the rainTLDR  Mr Mackey was right all along,Meth is bad mkay Or how I learned to stop worrying and love my coworkers,495

toxlab,54,52,1a77t6,393,I lucked into a great job working for an independent video game retailer This was back in the day when SNES and Genesis ruled the land and the Neo Geo and DO were the shining examples of high end gamingI worked at an old school coinop arcade in high school and when they closed down the owners sold me a full sized Tapper machine for fifty bucks It graced the living room of my bachelor pad for about a year before a friend told me that a new store had opened up in his neighborhood The owner wanted coinops for the sales floor of a game store I met with the guy and he was super cool Turns out he needs someone with product knowledge to run a booth at a flea market on the weekends After a couple of months of this I earn his trust and start working  days a week at the retail store and doing weekends at the dirt mallGene was a different breed of cat He wasnt a gamer but he knew what was up He DEMANDED we play new games the second they were released and based his purchases on our recommendations When games like Mortal Kombat came out we would make up xeroxed cheat sheets for the fatalities and sell them for a buck a piece If we could buy a used game and resell it that day he would let us pocket the difference Plus cash advances gas money and weekly poker and Jack Daniels parties in the back roomThe thing that really separated him from every other retailer Ive ever worked for was his business savvy If you brought him regular business and were a decent human being he would move heaven and earth for you He made a  mile round trip to pick up extra Game Gears one Christmas when none were available in our area He got import games for Sega CD for our loyal weaboos If you bought a new game we recommended and you felt it wasnt up to snuff hed give you full exchange value and just sell it as used Our customers loved him Most of themWe had machines set up upfront to test used games This was back in the dark ages when cartridge based systems roamed the land and repairing a used game usually amounted to blowing on the pins Still wed let you play Sonic for a couple of minutes to assure full value The problem was the store was in a strip mall and people would go into the restaurants with their friends and tell Junior to go waste time with the vidya until mommy had her fill of gossip and came to collect their crotchfruitGene was not a babysitter In fact truth be told he spent most of his time in his office watching porn on a pirated connection He hated kids They didnt understand release dates trade in values or system compatability Little Vern would want Street Fighter Five Extra Mega Super Edition The one with Pikachu and naked Chun Li because thats what Timmy said he had at home and Mom and Dad wouldnt understand why we couldnt fulfill a simple request for the birthday boy After all an eight year old knows better than SOME GODDAMNED MORON WHO PLAYS VIDEO GAMES FOR A LIVING AND ARE YOU CALLIN MY KID A LIARGene gave these customers what I called the Invitation to the World Hey its a big wide world out there We sell games What we dont do is babysit your mutant hellspawn until you deem fit to pick them up Maybe theres someone out there who does that Possibly while charging you a service charge Go there Thats my version of it Genes version was more like Hey fucko Collect your retarded offspring and get the fuck out of my store Next time you leave them here I offer them up to the creepy thirty year old with a paper route Hilarity would often ensue When one clueless individual stated that he had a RIGHT to leave his children unsupervised in the store while he partook of frosty libations at the steakhouse and then threatened Gene with physical violence Gene calmly removed his  millimeter from under the counter racked a shell into the chamber and said Walk out or get dragged out Your choice We never saw Daddy dearest againIt was a gamers wet dream Serious players come in We got the hook up You get top shelf gaming all day long Rentals on street date Used prices that cant be beat and fair trade ins New to games Well get that shit done son Find the perfect system from you clue you in to the gaming franchises that will have you ballin all night Love Street Fighter II Hell beat my Vega and Ill give you a freebie off the rack Come in with your three year old copy of Dragons Lair for SNES the rotten ringpiece of Super games with no box or instructions and insist its worth sixty bucks because thats what you paid for it I cant give that partial birth abortion of a game away for ten brand new Why dont I trade your  Gremlin in for a brand new Corvette while Im at it No I am the manager Would you like to meet the owner Okay No problem Let me tear him away from whatever vagina based programming hes watching and get him out here Oh hes obviously impressed by the big money you claim to spend here despite no one on staff ever having laid eyes on you before Wait Is he Yes I believe hes bending over spreading his cheeks and demanding that you just shove it in and break it offI spent two years at the foot of the master Every day was an adventure It was satisfying on so many levels

snowangel,97,102,15vx48,396,I worked a few years at a big box stores Portrait Studio You run into the most ridiculous customers here and if you think being a cashier is bad try spending at least an hour if not more time doing everything from sales to acting like a complete imbecile to try and make children smile for the cameraWe do EVERYTHING Photography clown around for the kids pose them sales no commission but it mattered cash register delivery give portraits to customer who pick up passports customer service phone calls booked appointments outreach cold calling contests it was a jack of all trades type roll Yet jobs dont seem to consider it ANYTHING on the resume grumbleHere are the events to one of the worst days working at this jobIt was a busy Saturday afternoon and it was only myself and my one coworker We had only worked together a couple of months and I had been at the job maybe  months I think one other girl was supposed to be there but called in sick  details are fuzzy on that one If she did its no surprise It happened often with THAT ONEhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsxeccompulsiveliarakathatone there are many stories with her I wont currently go intoIt had been an extremely busy day with almost all back to back appointments No lunch breaks for either of us I know its the law but sometimes its THAT busy We have  camera rooms and my coworker was in one with a family I was just able to get a breath after a customer left and in walks a man at around pm saying he has a pm appointment for a family portrait Me Are you the Smiths my pm appointment Him No my name is Singh I dont find him on my schedule and let him know so hes aggravated while Im still searching Ah I found it at pm like he said but yesterday I let him know his appointment was yesterday He is livid He starts yelling and blaming us for booking the wrong day I say I can try my best to fit him inMy pm doesnt seem to be showing up and can take him in right away Whos going to be in the photos I ask My family Me And they are  Next thing I know hes on his cell calling his wife and screaming at her for them not being at the studio He tells her they have an appointment Gee I wonder where the confusion of the appointment came about Hes a lot more calm now as he is embarrassed by this He tells me they can be here in an hour I say sorry we have a pm and are fully booked until closing At this point my coworker has come out of her photo room to see what is going on She pipes up in front of him No take him in That pm canceled I stare right into her eyes are you sure yes your positive yes Me Okay I can take you and your family at pm Situation was resolved pfft thats a laughpm rolls around and his family walks in ready for their photos Who walks in next Of course you knew this was coming My pm walks in They are pleasant and start getting ready in the lobby type area Okay so there are  camera rooms and only  of us and my coworker is still doing baby photos in one room and I now have standing here  families expecting photos right this minute I HATE my coworker right now Shes actually quite lovely but seriously HOW can you make a mistake like that How could I listen to her and not just call the customer to confirm Oh but reddit I dont think you saw this coming In walks a very plump and loud lady with  adorable but rowdy TRIPLETS Triplets I tell you I am not joking when as soon as they walked in they separated in a full run to play scream and circle me JUST like in a film  I actually stood in awe for a moment at how weird it was that they would do that as brats do on the hollywood screen Who was this lady Why she was my pm who never showed up I let her know her appointment was over an hour ago now and she was ANGRY In a booming voice she blames ME I told them I would be late when booking I told them How am I supposed to do this with triplets Utter hogwash because although we were heavily booked they would have at least booked her at  not pm Standing before me I had  families demanding photos that very minute Out of all the chaos this one young girl walks in and asks to pick up her photos Simple right Wrong it takes like  hour to deliver photos You have to make sure the order is correct then upsell with the extra photos that are in the package and put it through the system so they dont come back saying they never picked up All I can muster is I am SO sorry is there any way you could possibly come back tomorrow Im usually great with customer service I would have given her free stuff She was extremely sweet and agreed I was so overwhelmed and thankful she would do that for me Im not sure I would have been so nice myself The original man from yesterdays appointment Oh he went BESERK on my ass Screaming If that was me who came to pick up photos I would be SO angry Why are you understaffed You have all these appointments Why are you understaffed I literally had tears in my eyes and took the berating and mustered that I would take in the original pm as fast as I could and would take both the other appointments in as soon as I could The rest of the day was a blur The portrait studio still gives me nightmares sometimes there are so many other stories But I tell you to this day I REALLY wish I had more courage and just said Your appointment was yesterday Your appointment was over an hour ago Even if we had more employees we only HAVE  camera rooms how does THAT help If you dont like the amount of employees on do you REALLY think Im the one to yell at about it Both of you F off Im taking in the pmThanks for letting me rant Reddit ltTLDR Listen to your gut and stand up for yourself in a proper mannerEDIT I meant that I would take in the original pm and fit in the others when I could amp I really wanted to tell them all to fuck off except for the pm who were on time for their appointment and did nothing wrong Sorry I just wrote the wrong number down It was VERY late when I wrote this Of course I took in the pm with the appointment who wasnt late that was the most sane thing to do The pm was the least of my worries of the groupEDIT Thanks for all the comments For those of you wanting to know about THAT ONEhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsxeccompulsiveliarakathatone I made a post for her,It doesnt matter WHEN my appointment was Im here now,498
HeloRising,41,70,1qvprn,397,This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you The last one took off so I figured Id throw another one upI was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door This wasnt strictly unusual sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear though and all whiter than bleached snow A little odd but this was in an incredibly white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall it wasnt unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given daySo Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes I greeted them but they didnt take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes laterYoYo manyou got like any frogs Frogs Yeah weve got a couple of different ones they should be up on that shelf Naw dawg I saw those ones But Im lookin for somethin special Somethin gangstaI stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a gangsta frog looked like I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the newish guy She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for reals yoI told him to hold on and Id check in the back I went back where another employee was finishing up glazingHeyI dont know our whole stock yet Do we have anything back here that we dont have out there A couple of things why whatd they ask forlong pause A gangsta frogthe fuck is a gangsta frogI have no idea Do we have anything that meets that criteriaWeve got one with a big chain give him thatWe did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to himYeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii Thats what Im talkin bout Dats the shit right thereSo he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery His cohorts also selected figurines Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose From listening to their backandforth these were suitably gangsta choices for various reasonsAs they were painting my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song they had in fact begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working withThey took about an hour to finish their pieces I wouldnt have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on at length though Im not positive how a springing lion can look straight outta ComptonOnce they finished they paid with credit cards not as gangsta as a wad of cash but way easier for me to deal with and left Last I heard they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap To their credit they werent half bad at itAntics aside they were actually very nice and never gave us any static Never even heard the n word out of them which was sadly very common with the hiphop kids especially the white kids,They want gangsta frogs,467

up to my register positively fuming Im by myself again Mary Can someone help me with cat litter I cant find the cat litter Im looking for Me Yeah no problem I can help you At this point I give a look to my manager down the nearest aisle communicating that Im leaving so hell have to ringMe in the aisle So what litter are you looking forMary Im looking for lesser known cat litterMe Maam its right

He looks defeated Poor BobMe Im sorry about that Maam but this IS the litter youre looking for correct Mary Yes I would like it to go in the cartMe uhhhhhhhhhhhh okay Bob looks fit enough Hes a big guy Im a tiny girl but I can pick up bags no problem Buuuut okay Sure Maam How many bags would you like Mary TwoAnd without a thank you I put the bags in her cart and walk back up to the front with them to pay for their items I find my manager with a line and a LOT of bagging to do so I help him out I notice Mary is once again huffing and puffing like a blowfish She finally gets her turn and my manager has since gone to the office to let me ring up items by my lonesome Cue real troubleI scan her items she swipes her card she gets her senior discount and loyalty discount and I think Ive done everything right Not in her eyes Just as shes slowly pushing her cart to the door she explodesMary Um excuse me This is not the litter I wantedMe confused Its not Mary Of course it isnt This is

my eyesI must add that while this is going on poor Bob has left Mary and is now looking at our petthemed greeting cards Manager walks over and asks What seems to be the problem todayMary The problem is that she picked out the wrong litter This litter is WRONGManager Okay we just need you to fill out this return form so we can give you your money back Mary I already told HER jab of a finger in my direction that Im NOT filling it out And why hasnt anyone gone to get my new litter yetManager Let us call someone to get it for youMe paging unsuspecting stock boyHe arrives I tell him what we need which is only a  second walk away and he comes right back up with the bags and another stock boy This is turning into a showAs Mary stands with her hand on her hip lips so tight I wonder how long she can sustain that face my manager just rings her up with the returns Manager Maam your total comes out to about  dollarsMary WHAT BUT IM RETURNING THESE ITEMS She is so in our faces at this point that I back away from the register and cower behind my managerManager Yes but the new ones are more expensive as they are clumping cat litterMary I did not know this I thought they were the same price Manager No MamShes deliberating in her head then finally swipes her card My manager remembers her discounts thank god and we give her the new receiptBob comes back from his intense reading starts pushing the cart and Mary doesnt say anything back when we tell her to have a good dayMy manager turns to me and says when that happens just get them out of the store as quickly as possible Just write that the customer refused on the return formAnd with that I was left to explain Mary to my stock boys who had only witnessed the endWhat really gets to be about it is that I asked her if it was the litter that she wanted She said yes She saw the other litter bag same brand on the shelf and CLUMPING and NONCLUMPING have to be in the  pt font range Ridiculoustldr Lady doesnt lift a finger buys cat litter blames me for purchase changes cat litter Husband reads birthday cardsEdit Fixed Maam so it didnt look like Mom,She picked out the wrong litter This litter is WRONG,492
deleted,94,79,1e6ax5,391,I have worked here for almost two years now and Ive always refused tips but today was just so weird and different We were just talking and at the end of the transaction after I had closed the till she pulled out a hundred and I assumed she wanted me to break it down in twenties but she told me to keep it and then left I stood there shocked I chased after her and she saw me and said to keep it and then ran off I didnt report it because I was afraid I would get in trouble and instead pocketed it because otherwise it would go to the company Should I have reported it or was it okay for me to keep it this one time I am mainly surprise that someone out there is so nice and generous enough to just give away a real hundreddollar bill to a simple cashier ,I got a  tip from a customer today,470

Schmoogly,29,91,1i9uva,394,BEHOLD THE GREAT WALL OF TEXT  the only manmade literary work visible from the moon I used to work in a small music and DVD shop located on a train station concourse The shop was very very busy and very very small This story begins one balmy august evening when our keyholder to whom I did and will continue to refer to solely as The Idiot was taking the cash drawers out of the tills so we could close for the night The Idiot decided to stack the till drawers so they were balanced on the edge of a bin which was full of customers rubbish and predictably they all fell in Several thousand pounds in coins and notes was thoroughly mixed in with customers revolting rubbish This stuff was all food and drink wrappers bins are hard to come by in UK train stations thanks to the irritating habits of unsavoury people who kept putting bombs in themI spent the next hour after closing digging through rubbish with my bare hands trying to retrieve the days takings The bin STANK it was a hot day and it was full of ice cream wrappers and almost a full inch of miscellaneous food sludge into which all the change had fallen To his credit The Idiot did help out a bit This didnt stop me and the rest of our staff from giving him a hard time The tills were eventually refilled and handed to The Idiot so he could waddle off and lock them in the safe in the office I went home The next day I got in for the am morning shift to discover my Assistant manager on the phone to our head office as the safe would not open It turned out that in his frustration The Idiot had continued to live up to his name by slamming the safe door thereby breaking the safety glass and rendering it permanently locked Head office told us that they could send someone out to fix it but it would be am at the earliest which would mean that we would have to operate for  hours without any cash drawers We made signs with CARD OR EXACT CHANGE ONLY  apologies for any inconvenience and put them in front of all the tills We were also explaining the situation to everyone who came into the shop as they walked in Everyone seemed to understand or so I thoughtSo this oldish fella walks up to the till hes in his late s and is brandishing a couple of DVDs I explain the situation about the change drawers and tell him that he can either pay on his card or pay in exact change He looked confused His total was  and he had a  note I told him he can either forego the penny or come back later when weve got the tills I had already checked my pockets and given out the four pennies I had on me that morning His reaction was priceless He exploded WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY EH WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY Again I told him that we dont have any pennies to give again he got angry THIS IS DAYLIGHT ROBBERY LETS SEE WHAT THAT POLICEMAN HAS TO SAY ABOUT YOU ROBBING ME he gestured to a policeman who was patrolling the concourse ILL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR THISI told him You havent bought anything yet At present we do not owe you a penny I am simply informing you that if you were to buy this DVD in cash it would be on the condition that you would not receive your penny change You can pay by card you can forego the penny change or you can come back later when weve retrieved our change drawers from the safeI watched as the cogs and wheels in his head slowly whirred into place He looked down at the DVDs in his hand and then back up at me  Im not happy about this he said as he handed over the  note When he left he did go for a chat with the policeman I think he was expecting plod to leap into action round up all the shop staff and send us to jail The less dramatic reality was that the copper shrugged and I got back to work  Addendum  Loose endsThe Idiot wasnt reprimanded too harshly for breaking the safe or dropping the till drawers he suckedup to the manager extra hard for about  weeksWe received no overtime payment for the hour spent digging through the bins I got an infection in the nailbed of my finger about a day later It was very painful and I blame having to dig through garbage for change The old man returned the DVDs after  week He apparently wanted his extra penny refunded as well though I was not working that day,Well lets see what that policeman has to say about you ROBBING ME,485
conncollcamel,11,77,1i8btg,391,I work at a retail store where everything is constantly on sale from its original price kind of a scam but whatever Last night at work a man and woman in their late fortiesearly fifties walked up hand in hand to me at the jewelry counter I asked them if I could help them with anything and the man said No this is our first date so were just looking around A little confused I asked him Youre on your first date at insert retail store here and the woman responded saying Well weve known each other for over  years We dated in high school but things didnt work out and recently got back in touchI told her I thought that was sweet that they found each other again and that they looked very happy together The woman thanked me and looked to her date and said she was going to quickly look at the shoes As soon as she rounded the corner the man asked me to pick my favorite diamond ring from the counter as he was going to propose that night I helped him pick out a beautiful ring as quickly as I could so that the woman wouldnt see the ring before she got backToday the couple came in again SHE SAID YES They wanted to thank me for helping the man keep the proposal a surprise and helping him pick out such a beautiful ring These were by far the best customers I have ever had ,Not your typical tale cute with happy ending,468
grownmannaked,75,99,1hnicw,395,I work at a well known retail store that offered flip flops for  last Saturday  This is obviously a very popular sale and as a result we had a large line to get to the register  One lady had waited about an hour in line and once she got up there I noticed she had not bought any flip flops She got to the register and told me Wow I cant believe you guys have so many items on clearance  After I had rung her up her total was about  dollars which she said could not be possible  I took her though each item individually and she explained to me  isnt clearance clearance is  or  dollars I dont want any of these items and she walked away without purchasing anythingTLDR A lady waited in line for an hour on our busiest sale of the year and didnt buy any sale items didnt read the price tags and didnt buy anything, isnt clearance,494
Osiris,45,105,1brtw8,390,Previously on Gas Station AdventuresWhy am I bleeding Or how simple statements can lead to assault chargeshttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsboqxqwhyamibleedingorhowsimplestatementscan  Yelling a the wrong guy or how a bitchy lady learned what handcuffs felt likehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbagdyellingatthewrongguyorhowabitchyladyBefore I begin I should preface this by saying that the stories Im telling here are in no way actually in chronological order  Its more of a oh hey remember that one time that kind of story tellingThis even occurred late in the shift  It was dark out and traffic had died off to almost nothing  Our station is present tense its still there even if I dont work there located at the beginning of a cul de sac along with an oilandlube shop a family diner a dentists office a McDonalds and a flowercoffee shop  There was just myself and another employee out playing gas attendant but since there werent any customers we were instead standing in the middle of the pumps conversing as coworkers do  I also had my phone out texting my thengirlfriend  Aside from the roar of the nearby freeway the world was for the moment quietBut slowly we heard a noise  It was obviously coming closer but truck traffic made it hard to determine what it was let alone where it was coming from  After a few minutes we determined that it was a human voice yelling something  It soon became apparent that the voice was coming from a woman up the street a bit from the cul de sac  She was in fact SCREAMING her lungs out  As she wandered her way up the street vaguely in our direction we began to understand what she was saying  Mostly it was gibberish word salad without form or grammar with the occasional guttural moan or shrill yelp  A few coherent phrases came through as well the most memorable of which was Come back me up MarinesMy associate and I watched in stunneddisturbed fascination as this mad woman walked up our cul de sac and entered the McDonalds  No entered isnt the right term  She CONQUERED herself in there like a cowboy hero busting open the swinging halfdoors to the saloon in an old western right before he challenges the bad guy in a black hat to a highnoon show downOnce inside we could see her moving around  Not up at the counter but amongst the tables and chairs  She spent several minutes in there and it was obvious that the McDonalds staff wasnt happy about it because the guy we knew to be manager was pointing to the door and saying something to her  She did not appreciate being informed where the egress was as she started to throw around items like trays handfuls of napkins straws cup lids whatever detritus she could find and running full tilt from the counter to the bathrooms and back againMy associate and I chuckled  Poor MickeyDs schmucksAt some point her eccentric ha orbit of the dining area destabilized and she was ejected from the premises by her own inertia  The two of us on the pumps then turned our heads as we didnt really want to deal with something like that right before quitting time  However we were either too slow or not camouflaged well enough because her next course change sent her directly our wayI still had my phone out sending updates on the weird event to my gf  The crazy lady approached but didnt really seem like she was interested in communing with whatever it was she thought we were  That is until she saw my phone out and my thumb on the keypad  THAT piqued her interest and in nonetookind a manner  She stalked over to me came within about  and hisswhispered If you call the cops Im going to fucking kill you  Oh dear  Thats not exactly what you would call a smart threat given that she then wandered towards the parking lot on the back side of the store still shouting randomly and occasionally flailing her large purse around  Out of reach and out of eyesight I called it in  My coworker wandered a bit over to the side to see if she was going to mess with anything in the backApparently I wasnt the only one who had called  about this lady because the police response time already quite quick was extraordinarily fast  Well under  minutes as I was still giving information to the dispatcher when the two units arrived  Just as the officers got out of their cars we heard a loud crash of breaking glass along with my coworker yelling HEY and pointing at the woman  The two officers broke into a run as did I and came around the corner to find her with a piece of pipe that had been left near the recycling bin smashing the window to the small outbuilding which contained some sort of monitoring equipment for the underground gas tanksThe moment she saw the two officers however it was like a switch got flipped  She instantly calmed down and became intelligible  She put down the pipe and complied with the officers as they asked her to come out to the front of the store which was on camera and better lit  The officers asked her for ID which she calmly produced from a back pocket  Another officer arrived at this point but went down to the McDonalds to talk with the manager  The two officers with the lady were interviewing her asking her what might be the reason that people were calling about her her responding that she was just having a bad night etc etc  After a few minutes of this the officer who had been down at the McDonalds came up to talk to us two pump jockeys  We relayed our perspective of what happened to him and he went over to the other two officers  Now Im uncertain as to what that officer said to the other two but he soon went back to his car and began to drive it up to our parking lot  As that was happening the two officers with the lady asked her to stand and if they could search her purseThis is as they say the climax of the storyFor she stood as she was asked and grabbed her purse as if to drop it  However instead of doing so her hand returned with a smallcaliber compact pistol which she raised up and fired  Now thankfully she didnt actually point the thing AT anybody  Her aim was directly between the two officers and both of us wage slaves were off to her left  So the three rounds she fired werent REALLY a danger to anyone with the exception of a possible ricochet or that poor barkdust hillside which took three rounds amidshipsThe two officers with her reacted instantly not with guns drawn but with a very well choreographed double tackle  Her gun was taken from her hands as she squirmed and screamed all manner of vile epithets  The third officer heard the shots and his big VInterceptorPackagedPoliceCharger roared up between the pumps  The three officers had a hell of a time getting her into cuffs because even though she was slight she was feistyEventually she was controlled with handcuffs and leg restraints along with the arrival of another couple officers and eventually an ambulance  One officer had sustained a rather nasty cut to his forehead during the struggle the cause of which I do not know  The woman now lying in the back of a police cruiser still screaming and trying to kick the window was being taken to jail for booking and then almost immediately to a hospital for a psych eval  The two officers were visibly quite shaken and I overheard them asking if they could take the rest of their shift off  In a quiet community like that its not often that officers end up being shot atIn the end I believe that the lady was committed for sanity issues which does make me feel bad for her  A crime scene tech recovered the bullets from the hillside which Im happy to say recovered from its injuries and we were thanked by the police officers for our quick call to   I went home drank a couple beers and went to sleep dreaming of crazy ladiesTLDR  One of the better nights sleep Ive ever had actuallyEDIT  I cant link well,Shots fired Or I dont think the Marines are going to help you out this time lady,495

jdpatric,74,92,1p293f,385,After reading Layaway httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsptwdlayaway I thought of my time at the hardware store and rentalsI was going to post it there as a comment but its just really long I used to work at a small hardware store in a medlarge town We offered a few in store services and one of them was rentals We had two different types of carpet cleaners we rented along with pressure washers Each rental had a form we had to fill out on the computer We didnt require an email address but we did require an in state drivers license or some form of military ID two phone numbers and a credit card we charged the deposit to the credit card Note If youre reading this you probably know that a debit card can be run as credit provided it has a major logo on it I cant tell you how many people Ive had to explain this to Especially when cashiering Here are a few stories of people doing rentalsNumber oneAngry guy comes in AGAG  I need to patch a hoseMe  OK heres the aisle where we sell hose mendersAG  No Its for a pressure washerMe  What Like gas powered  PSI pressure washerAG  No its  PSIMe  We dont sell anything to patch that kind of hoseAG  WhyMe  Because it could kill youAG  Ohhow much to rent a pressure washer hoseMe  I dont think we rent just the hose out let me checkMe  Sorry you have to rent the machine Its  with a  deposit that gets refunded when you return the machineAG  Thats not too badsign me upMe  I need a drivers license and a credit card sirAG  Well I dont have a credit card just cashMe  Sir the deposit is required to be on a cardAG  I want to see a managerManager tells him the same thing Finally the guy gets agitatedAG  If your store wasnt so cheap I could just use my Visa and this wouldnt be a problemMe  Thatd workAG  No it wont Its a debit card you idiotMe  Actually it will run quite nicely as either credit or debit I have the same card from the same bank and use mine here at least once a weekAG obviously flustered and embarrassed as hell now  Fine Ring me upHe called back later to complain that it wouldnt start It was out of gashed been trying to figure out what was wrong with it for an hourAG  What do you mean I have to put gas in itMe  Well sir it runs on gas didnt really know what else to sayAG  You guys dont put gas in them for meMe  Sir we dont sell gas hereAG  hangs upHe tried to get a refund for the machine later Was turned downNumber twoA guy wearing a Bluetooth and a full business suit comes into the store in a HUGE hurry HHHH  I need to rent a carpet cleaner and Im in a rushMe  Ok Ive done plenty of these and will have you out of here in no time I need a drivers license and a credit card pleaseHH  OK hands me the stuffOn the rental form I was required to get a home and a cell phone It was OK to get two cellsheck even a relatives cellhome just so long as we had two legit phone numbers This was a CYA for the cashier as much as for the owner If the machine goes missing the owner has two places to call looking for it and if the cashier puts two phone numbers even if it was just a neighbor then the cops had a second thing to go onor so the owner told us I was OK with it it was the rulesMe  OK last thing I need a home and a cell phone numberHH  My cell is when he said this I kind of expected the worst  not really just use that you dont need my home phoneMe  Sorry sir the form requires two phone numbers for the rental HH  Well we dont give out our home phone number to anyone we dont want telemarketers to callMe  We dont give this information out to anyone in fact this particular computer isnt even connected to the internetHH  Well I dont have a home phone lieMe slightly annoyed at being lied to  Sir I can use another celldoes your wife have oneHH  Yes but Im not giving you that eitherMy manager who knew I was a veteran at this had seen the debacle beginning to unfold and had stepped over to assist thankfullyManager  Its the store policy from the owner sir Im afraid theres nothing we can do it you wont give us two phone numbersHH  This is insane Fine Heres my work cell really all thatI ring him up and set him on his way Didnt think anything of it I the next had three days off due to the way my semester was scheduled at the time and then was on for four days When I returned the owner was on the phone yelling at someone not terribly unusual owner was great but occasionally he had to call people and be that guyThe next day someone goes to return a carpet cleaner using the form the guy had rented it with the previous WEEK at this point Theres a huge late fee which the guy had negotiated down a bit with the owner Note the guy returning HHs machine is not HHNew guy NG  I need to return thisMe  OK do you have the card it was rented on expecting the worst we needed the card to refund the depositNG  Yeah HH wont be needing it anymore Hes been firedTurns out the guy was a really midlevel fairly new employee at a local company who had invited a bunch of friends to his office to watch college football they had several rather large TVs and projectors for conferences and such apparently and party on Saturday with the intent of cleaning up the mess on Sunday Something went awry when he tried to use his company card to pay for the rental and got caughtNumber three On a really cold day a sketchy guy and his equally sketchy wifepartnernot even sure what walk into the store and ask to rent a pressure washer This is in Florida so cold is a relative term but it was legit winter and the high was in the low s I wouldnt want to pressure wash on a day like thatSketchy guy SG  I need to rent a pressure washerMe  OK I need a drivers license and a credit cardSG  Uhhhh one sec says to sketchy lady SL dig my license outta your purse for me Back to me Can you fill the rest out while she does thatMe  Ummm sure I dont see why not I need a Home phone and a cell moving to the next open bracketsSG  Uhhhh my cell is insert number here and I dont have a home phoneMe  I need two numbers sirSL very quietly and under her breath to SG  Just make one up quick hunSG Thinking that for some ungodly reason I couldnt hear SL  Yeah uhhhmy home phone is insert some obviously made up number hereMe  Yeah Im not going to put that in You just made that upSG  How do you know I didnt make the first one upI was about to reply saying because you didnt pause for  seconds between each number and forget our area code with the first one when SL picked this moment to find SGs drivers licenseSL  Oh heres his licenseI take one look at it and I see the saddest excuse for a fake ID Ive seen Probably ever It was beat to death The guy on there while also a very sketchy individual was NOT SGMe  Sir Im sorry I cant rent you this machinethis is not you in the pictureThe computer we used for rentals was LITERALLY on the wall of the owners office and the walls didnt connect to the ceiling so he could hear whenever we had a problem with a rental and he had one way glass so they could see it tooOwner comes out of the office and tkaes the fake ID  Sir Im going to ask that you hang around here for a few minutes until the police arrive or I wont be giving you your drivers license backSG  KEEP IT runs away with SL in towOwner didnt really call the cops but pinned the license up to ward off future attempts to steal our machinesNumber fourThis is one of my all time favoritesA couple in their late s early s walk in the door and right off the bat I can see something is off They just look a little confusedsomethings just differentI could tell Me  Howre yall doing today yeah southern drawl Id put it on for retail lol Can I help you with anythingConfused couple CC  Utter silenceMe now confused myself  Can I help youCC  Still silentAt this point they began to sign to each other and I determined that they were both deaf Well that explains a lot Found out that they were both INCREDIBLY proficient at reading lips to the point where they warned me not to mutter anything negative under my breath as theyd probably pick that up too We communicated via writing on slips of paper They need a carpet cleaner Ok no problem I write that I need  a drivers license and a credit card They gladly provided me with both Since they could read lips I would usually just ask them questions and theyd writeMe  OK I just need a home and a cellphonenumber I realized how ridiculous this was as I was asking for itthey were DEAF why would they have a phoneThe man just looked at me with a stare that said what the fuck am I going to do with a phoneMe  Ummmsorryone secI go straight to the owner who happened to be there that day obviously he hadnt heard much if any of the one sided conversation I was having with CC I explain the situation to the owner At first he doesnt budgeOwner  We need two phone numbers no matter whatMe  Owner They Are DEAF They dont HAVE one phone between them let alone twoOwner  YeahI guess weve never had this come up beforeummmYeahUhhhhjust fill in the blanks with numbersHad anyone but the owner told me to do that Id have told them to pound sand but that came from the tippity top and it was already an odd case so I punched it right inThey didnt give us any trouble at all returned it same day and everything went fine,Yes Yes we DO require two phone numbers to rent a  dollar machine,477

serophia,60,73,19mayn,386,Long time reader first time poster I have stories beyond number of my time in retail but this one will always stand out as the most absurd to me This was many years ago so I may not remember the dialogue word for word but I dont think Ill ever forget any of the other details I was  years old fresh out of high school and working parttime at a Shack that sold electronics We were paid by commission at the time with additional bonuses for certain items like cellphones for example Any large sale was always very exciting for us but we never tried to sell a customer something he didnt need or want since having it returned would have the same commission money coming out of our next paycheckOne day I was helping a rather heavy set middleaged man purchase a TV It was a display the last one we had of its model We had a policy where instead of giving a discount on a display item we would double the manufacturers warranty up to one additional year This guy was happy with that and got to play with the TV to make sure it worked properly and everything He even bought two cellphones while he was there one for him and one for his wife He complimented me on my service and left happyFast forward a week or two later and I see the same guy come into the store so I step up to see what else I can help him with Turns out that was a mistake because he was angry as hell Started ranting about how the piece of shit TV I sold him was defective because it took a couple seconds for the display to power up when he turned it on He demanded to know what I was going to do about it Always happy to help I said I didnt honestly remember if it was doing that or not when it was in our store but if hes unhappy with the way its working we could either a send it to our repair center to have it fixed or b take it back and give him his money backBut either way he needed to bring the TV back to the store He said that neither of the options I offered were good enough and there was no way he was going to go through the trouble of bringing that piece of shit TV back in and he wanted to know what I was going to do for himI was completely dumbfounded I repeated what I said earlier thinking maybe he misunderstood Either solution seemed acceptable to me but he disagreed and insisted I do something else because he just wasnt going to bring the TV in We went back and forth like this for a couple minutes because I just couldnt comprehend what else he wanted me to do When I flat out asked him he said What I want is for you to do your fucking jobJust when I thought that the situation couldnt get any more absurd he then asked if I wanted to step out into the parking lot and settle this Thats when a coworker that was listening near by stepped in and told the guy flat out that he didnt care what his problem was that was unacceptable and he needed to leave nowThe customer started yelling even louder said Fine then I want to return THIS and pulled his cellphone that I sold him out of his pocket and SLAMMED it down on the counter The screen immediately shattered and bits of the case broke off and flew everywhere Without thinking I said the first thing that popped into my mind We cant return that its broken We couldnt have taken it back no matter what once it was activated he had to deal with the cellphone service provider and not us But the situation was so absurd that I said it without thinkingHe picked up the mangled phone and threw it against the wall where it exploded into tiny pieces Then he turned on his heel and stomped out of the store without another wordI was still so shocked by the encounter that I had to go sit down in the back but once I calmed down I found the whole thing hilarious To this day I still wonder if he really thought that a tiny  year old girl was going to fight him in the parking lot over his stupid TVA couple days later we got a call from the corporate headquarters saying they had a customer complaint about one of our associates stealing his phone My manager said that we had his phone in a plastic bag here at the store and the customer was welcome to come pick it up whenever he wantedHe never did,We cant return that its broken,459
AnthraxyWaxy,82,81,1q6hrx,388,The title is hyperbole but this lady was pretty insane  I worked for a large coffee chain inside of a grocery store and the training there was horrible  I was given about a week and a half of training and then left on my own for whole  hour shifts without any help  Also I cant have caffeine otherwise I get dizzy and nauseous  This means that I had little experience with coffee drinksNaturally my first day working on my own was a bit of a disaster  Somehow I had not yet learned that latte refers to the steamed milk not to the espresso Well this one lady who Ill name TB for Total Bitch came up to the counter and asked for a Chai Latte  I thought I had this one in the bag and so without looking it up I make a Chai which has goddamned caffeine in it to begin with and add espresso  All the while this lady was pacing around looking incredibly impatientI gave her the Chai and told her to have a nice day  She muttered a thank you and then took a tiny little test sip  She then proceeds to freak the fuck outTB  OH MY GOD DOES THIS HAVE COFFEE IN IT  QUICK GET ME A GLASS OF WATER OH GOD I CANT HAVE CAFFEINE  IM ABOUT TO PASS OUT OH MY GODMe having a heart attack at this point  Oh my gosh Im so sorry quickly get her water all the while apologizing profusely Im really really sorry  Im new here but I should have known better  Here let me remake and refund your drink and Ill give you a coupon for a free drink next time you shop at our chain  Again I cant apologize enoughTB  THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH  Get me your manager NOWMe  Yes maam of courseI call up my manager and explain the situation to him and he makes his way over apparently taking way too long for this lady who is huffing and puffing about  She then yells at him for about five minutes about how incompetent and stupid I am refuses to take another drink from me but does take the refund and coupon and goes back to shoppingLater still a bit shaken from my first ever crazy customer and slowly realizing that that little sip of caffeine would never send my body in a spin I see her just  feet away at self checkout  Shes yelling at her husband on the phone because apparently the TV wont work and he cant fix it   All the while she is standing at a selfcheckout kiosk and is obviously too angry to swipe her groceries  The person manning the selfcheckout area has to come over and swipe and bag her groceries for herShe tells her husband she is going to call the cable company and a few minutes later I hear her yelling into the phone  GET ME YOUR MANAGER ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW  I broke down laughing and learned that day that some people are just assholes,This has caffeine OH GOD IM GOING TO DIE,469

Stabbies,36,77,1mbnml,388,I dont work in retail but you guys seem lenient about that type of thing and there isnt a shippingreceiving subreddit So Ill just post this here Let me know if thats against the rules and Ill delete itSo I work in shippingreceiving for a massive company in a large city We would receive dozens of boxes over the course of each day and all of them would be signed for loaded and delivered to their recipients by me I also handled outgoing mail and boxes but thats irrelevant to the storyMy company shares a a building with a few other companies all of them much smaller than mine Regardless they all had their own shipping and receiving people Despite being in the same building each business had a separate address so its rare that something gets sent to the wrong place But it does happenI received a large heavy box one day It had my company address on it but the name on the box was someone who worked at another company in the building and that company name was also on the box Lets call this company G As per protocol I called the shippingreceiving desk for G told them I had a box for them and asked them to come sign for itThe shipping guy at G told me that he didnt want to come get it I needed to deliver it to him and he sure as hell wasnt going to sign for his own fucking boxThis a problem because my company protocol clearly states that once Ive signed for a box with a shipping company I CAN NOT let that box leave my possession without a signature from the receiver Whether this box went to someone in my company or not I was liable for whatever happened to it until I had a signature for itAsshat working at G even after hearing my explanation refuses to signSo I wrote not at this address on the box and sent it out via outgoing boxes that night I got it back a few days later I assume that the receiver just thinks that the building address is his company address The shipping guy at G still wouldnt sign for it so I sent it out again once again labelled Not at this addressI got it back again a few days laterSo Ive been receiving and shipping this box over and over for about three weeks now I dont really have a choice in the matter but the Fedex guy and I have been having a laugh over it The box is starting to look like someone tried to put it through a paper shredder The shipping and receiving guy at G has become increasingly furious at me for not just giving him the box but theres nothing I can do about it The entire building is keycard restricted I cant deliver the box to the receiver myself because I dont have access to G company floors I dont know whats in the box and theres no way in hell Im breaking protocol because this guy is too lazy to sign his fucking name on the dotted line Apparently he has the receiver breathing down his neck because according to the tracking number the box has been received sent back received and sent back repeatedly Hes been called repeatedly by the sender to confirm his name company name and address before the box is sent back each time Im curious about how many hundreds of dollars went into shipping this box back and fourth for almost a month The poor receiver has been waiting on whatever the hell is in this box for three weeks longer than necessaryEventually I called the company contact thats been sending the box back explained it to him and he said hed fix the label the next time he got the box I never saw that box again but I still hate the shipping guy who works at G,In which a large box is sent and received dozens of time because an employee refuses to sign for it,465
Bravesfan,33,79,1lsrqu,385,This is my favorite story of all time It can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsmoxsweetlittleoldladiesarethebestcustomersHi everybody This is my first time posting to this sub I actually just found it last night and couldnt wait to spill the beans on my boss but wanted to sleep on it so that I could remember all of the stories that I couldA little background on me I was hired the summer right after I graduated high school to start in a grocery store I was hired as a checkerstocker to start out with and how very quickly that changedAnyways boss seems insanely nice during the interview and telling me that I was hired I thought Great I have a nice boss to work for Thisll be fun Oh how naive I wasStory  I always had TuesThurs off for school and usually one other day during the week mostly on Wednesday I come back to work on Friday as an opening checker Im met at the door by my redfaced highly irate boss this was towards the end of my stint at this store He goes off on me about how something wasnt done in the deli right on Thursday I inform him that I was at school and even though I was trained in the bakerydeli I wasnt at the store to screw something up He proceeds to blame it all on me saying that I should have known it would happen and showed up to prevent it I was flabbergasted but just walked away and went on with my workStory  The day before Thanksgiving in  our store was a madhouse We had  cashiers but only  lanes I was there to be a checkercarryoutcartfetcher for the day Theres a small lull in the action and our bookkeeperfront end manager asks me if I will run to the bank with her to get change since the bank wont be open again until Monday and she was in her s and I wasnt going to make her carry it all herself We go to the bank and I end up carrying something along the lines of  lbs of change inside After being back at the store for  minutes the asst manager calls me behind the service desk and hands me a write up for not retrieving carts from the parking lot Before we left I had gathered all the carts and ran them back inside During the  minutes we were gone I guess a massive rush showed up and cleared out the carts and people left them in the parking lot Even with  other people there to gather carts I was the one written up I signed it just because I needed to help somebody with a western unionStory  I was changing light bulbs in the store with the help of a stocker to hand me the bulbs the long fluorescent ones My boss shows up yells at the stocker to go do something productive and then yells at me for doing what I am I inform that he told me to do it first chance I had after I arrived that morning He gives me a youre annoying me sigh walking off and bumping the ladder I was standing on Hard I fall off twist my ankle and bust  light bulbs My boss tells me to clean it up and when Im done theres a writeup slip for me to sign I refuse He threatens to fire me I threaten a lawsuit he shuts upStory  My buddy was getting married and I was in the wedding and we were going on a float trip for the bachelor party I asked to leave early on Thursday and have Friday off and to leave at noon on Saturday the day of the wedding I ask about  months in advance he calls me in about  days before the bachelor party and tells me that I cant have any of the days off because I didnt give him enough notice I figure Ok I can deal with not making the bachelor party although itll suck but Im in the wedding I inform him that Im in the wedding and that I can come in a different day to make up the hours if he wants me to He tells me You cant go because Im your boss and I said so I inform him that Im going to the wedding and whatever consequences I face Ill deal with later I miss the bachelor party and Saturday rolls around When I walk in he asks if I can receive a shipment for him at  I tell him that Im leaving at  for the wedding and he says that if I leave then I wont have a job the next day I walk away and leave at  I walk in the next day and still have my jobStory  I was facing zoning the toilet paper aisle one day because I was just a stocker that day and I got everything out that needed to be out I ran out right before he went to lunch to get carts and did again about  minutes before he got back Im standing on a milk crate to reach the very back of the shelf to reach something when all of a sudden my boss comes around the corner and kicks the milk crate out from underneath me I fall taking out half the shelf with me stand up and ask him What the fuck was that for He tells me that I didnt get the carts and he had to get them after his lunch and it wasnt his job he brought in  damn carts I watched the video I tell him that he can pick the toilet paper up himself and that Im going to lunch I come back an hour later and I see our office managerfront end manager our sweet  year old lady from earlier picking up the toilet paper I ask her why and she said that Mike our boss had told her she had to I tell her that Ill take care of it I grab all the toilet paper that I can while still leaving a respectable amount for the customers and go and stack it in his office He threw a bitch fit when he got back and wrote me up I refused againStory  I had placed my  week notice in and I had  days left Hes pissed Im leaving because I trained all the new checkers and I was the only person he had up front who could run the whole service desk beside our sweet yo office manager He takes me in to his office and tells me that he wants me to stay I told him that Id had enough of his crap I fould a better job with better pay running the warehouse of a competitive grocery store and I had a few friends that I knew work there He tells me that hell tell the new store that Im a horrible employee I let him know that he talked to our office manager and got a great recommendation from her for me He calls her in the office and attempts to rip her a new one and shes had enough Mike you leave this poor boy alone Hes done everything that youve asked him to do and hes getting out of here Youre an asshole and if you even attempt to write me or him up Ill quit and youll have to do the books yourself or hire someone else He isnt capable of doing the books He tells her to leave and then proceeds to start ripping me a new one I walk out and go back to my register and start ringing up a new customer He comes over the intercom  times with variations of Bravesfan come to the office now I refuse He walks out and stands outside his office and yells in front of customers employees and everybody in that store Bravesfan get your fucking ass in this office right now you piece of shit Everybody in the store looks at me as I calmly reply Ive got  days left whatre you gonna do fire me He storms back in the office I receive applause It was awesomeACTUAL GOOD STORY FOR ONCEStory  I was bringing carts inside and I almost hit some older lady who was walking out while I was walking in I said Oops Didnt mean to almost run you over Im sorry Her husband stands there and says Ive been trying to run her ass over for years now And I just lost it laughing She hits him with her purse and calls him an asshole in a joking manner and they walked out holding handsTLDR Old boss was a complete jerk and  cute story at the endNote Sorry this is so long but I had a few stories to share And also all names used are not the employees actual namesEDIT Since this thread blew up Ill add a few other things Since so many people have told me to do so I went ahead and contacted corporate and HR The statue of limitations for battery in my state is  years so I will talk to somebody about it Although since Im  hours away at college I will more than likely just back up what the other charges have said or if he plans on pleading guilty to them then I will throw mine into the mix to add to his miseryAs to why I never laid a hand on him first Im a  guy and weigh roughly  lbs whereas my boss was near  and weighed about  I also thought about anything that could have legally happened to me had I done anything and didnt want to deal with the hassle Even though I never foresaw taking him to court I can definitely say now that refraining from hitting him is going to helpAnd as to why I stayed another poster had said it I was just out of high school and stupid My family is quite well off so what I made was completely mine minus gas car insurance car payment phone payment and I tend to spend quite a bit of money and I didnt want to do anything to threaten my job or quit until I had something else lined upI appreciate all the comments everybody,The boss to end all bosses,464

bwettfett,35,70,1jchln,383,I work at a roast beef restaurant about three weeks ago I was working drive through during a pretty heavy rain and it was getting hard to hear anyone over the thunder A car pulls up and I can barely hear this person speaking her order I keep asking her to speak up but its a futile effort After a full two minutes of waiting for the person to either pull up like I asked her to or speaking up I hear her now crystal clear screaming at me I have told you I want the number fifteen with no sauce  five times I calmly apologize to her and ring in her order When she pulls around I take her money and she yells at me for wasting her time I leaned out the window and said honestly I could not hear you I dont know what the problem was long story short we deduced that she had been yelling her order through the window at the speaker Shed kept the window up because she didnt want to get wet She asked me why the speaker couldnt hear her when she could hear me She said she shouldnt have to wait for her slow power windows to come upShe has now done this three times so I have dubbed her The Fruit RollUp,The fruit rollup,453
nanabattmaaaannnnn,128,97,1f7hp9,388,Alright this is my first time posting on here so bear with me as far as formatting and such I used to work for a major retail company  I worked in the Electronics Department and was one of our top performing employees All of our guest scores had risen significantly since transferring to this store and I was also a very well rounded employee I worked not only within electronics but any other department I was needed including logistics and guest service There was a Spanish teacher at a nearby high school who was nice enough to assign a video project in which these groups of HS students had to film a short ad in spanish in the specific store I worked The problem is we do not allow video recording within the store without permission from the store and district manager as well as a film permit A group of high school girls and their overenthusiastic mother come into electronics and begin filming right in the middle of the main aisle complete with other customers I go up to them and calmly and extremely nicely explain that they can not record within the store without a permit Before I even have a chance to say anything more the lady loses it and by loses it I mean she flips her shit Starts berating me and my job saying that I work minimum wage and need to shut the hell up and let them do their assignment and get the hell out of their way I ask her to please remain calm that I would be more than willing to bring the manager over but that she could not continue filming especially if there are other customers in the video against their will I think I honestly said something along the lines of if she posts this on youtube the unsuspecting customers have every right to sue her to the full extent of the law maybe not  true but I was losing patience So the manager Derptina comes over She asks whats wrong and replies with Oh sure go ahead and film Have a great dayOk This pisses me off Im a former film student I know how much trouble our store as well as my manager can now get in I try explaining that to her but she wont listen so I make her move me to another department if there is going to be filming within electronics flash forward to the next day group of teenage boys comes in to film I tell them they are more than welcome to go speak with a manager but until they have her permission they are not allowed to film The lead guy of the group starts cussing at me calling me every name in the book and before I have a chance to snap and tear him a new one I tell him to leave my dept until a manager gets there I call Derptina back to the dept Derptina Could you please come to electronics I have a verbally abusive guest and need assitance before he turns violent her response Sorry Im actually eating right now so its going to be at least  minutes before I can get over therekey words Verbally abusive violent REALLLY Then as soon as Derptina comes back she pulls me off the floor and proceeds to try and coach me She says I did not handle the situation according to policy I tried explaining to her what happened and reminded her that she was supposed to come to the dept or at least send an AP guy overNeedless to say Derptina is seriously trying to blame me for the guy blowing up on me despite the numerous other employees who have told her that I did nothing wrong She then starts blaming me for the  drop in guest service and all of the other problems within the dept that I had actually fixedSo in a moment of lack of judgement in a job I didnt really need I did what I had wanted to do in every other retail job at some point or another and told her to and I quote Take this job and shove it TlDR Idiots filming in store manager wont take care of it guest gets verbally abusive Take this job and shove it,Take this job and shove it,485
FilmYak,97,130,1bt3cm,385,I was picking up some meds from the local pharmacy and had my three year old son with me The woman handling the register started asking him if he had any brothers or sisters He said no and she started on with you have to tell your mommy and daddy to give you a brother or sister Yammering on for a minute about this ignoring my wide eyed appeals for her to shut her pie hole eventually telling me directly I needed to give him a sibling It was very hard work on my end not to chew her out and punch her in the face See we had already told our son a few months earlier that he was going to have a sibling and then my wife miscarried Now the idiot at the register didnt know that and in her head Im sure she was being nice but she couldnt have pressed a more damaging button if shed tried All she had to do was keep her mouth shut and I hope any retailers reading this  screw it I hope any decent people reading this  learn that sometimes they need to stop as soon as no I dont have any siblings has been established Ps  after  miscarriages we did end up with a healthy second kid Just adding this because I am not asking for sympathy votes Im just asking for people to be aware before they tell a compete stranger they need to have more kidsEdit thanks everyone for the kind words but seriously its ok  Both miscarriages were at around first heartbeat time and my wife and I were both approaching  so as much as it sucked we were relatively prepared for it  And again we did have a nd child eventually and hes just months away from turning   We are all well it was just a frustrating story that stands out because it was so  well she was TRYING to be cheerful while talking to a cute little boy she clearly had no clue it was a stupid thing to say and continue talking about but boy it pissed me offEdit several folks have asked if Im sure it was a pharmacist not a cashier  I am not sure  I just know she was working behind the pharmacy counter and Im using that term for the sake of simplicity  I have no idea if its right or wrong in her case this was about  years ago,Well meaning but idiot pharmacist,515
toxicpretty,28,76,1a3vgj,389,I had a similar experience when I worked as a makeup consultant for a small chain of  boutique makeup stores We worked in a mall and gave free mini makeovers for customers in order to get them interested in our products I worked along side a more senior associate who had quite the attitude She made it a point to only target people who looked liked they had money to burnshed leave the rest to me I didnt care cause it was just fun making people look their bestI loved showing people how to create a beautiful look for themselves and I actually like most of our products so it was easy to recommend them One day a couple of little girls came in to ask for makeovers Because they looked about twelve the older associate quickly brushed them off saying they needed to go play We were slow as hell and they looked so eagerI immediately said that I would love to help them The senior associate reminded me that I was wasting company time and resources on children and that their mom was going to be pissed as hell But I figured that it was just for fun and besides I could show them how to make it look natural and simple Maybe even help them avoid the god awful selftaught looks that little girls usually do So I sit the first one down and start to cleanse Immediately I realize that despite being an exceptionally beautiful little girl shes sporting a serious cleft lip scar She tells me that shes always hated itand asks if I know how to diminish it I tell her that shes in luck since I know some theater makeup tricks I learned in high school not to mention Im a painter Long story shortI give both girls a killer natural look but most importantly I completely hide the cleft lip  Gone The look of utter adoration and joy was worth a dozen sales and I sent them off feeling pretty satisfiedI thought that was the end of the story but I was wrong A half hour goes by and suddenly a woman rushes in demanding to know who gave a makeover to her daughter I immediately recognize the little girl with the cleft lip  trailing behind her The senior consultant smiles and points to methinking Im about to get a major chewing out But instead I am immediately hugged There are tears and laughs as the mother urgently explains that Im a miracle worker and that her daughter has never looked so beautiful She then goes on to tell me that her daughter is a steady pageant contestant who has racked up many a trophy despite the cleft lip but now she NEEDS me to teach her how to fix the scar Fast forwardtwenty hugs and a professional makeup consultation is scheduled This is a  dollar service we offer for people wanting a full specialized consultation facial cleansing and makeup application I want to add at this point that I worked on a base paycommission statusmaking a small bonus for each item I sell along with my hourly rate The  professional consultation comes with a nice commissionThe senior consultant was shocked and then grumpy at this turn of events but wrote it off as lucky but unlikely to lead to any major sales due to the girls ageOh how wrong she wasThree days later at the scheduled time three people showed up instead of two The little girl her mom and her dad There is a weird feeling in the airnot bad just weird It doesnt take long to realize that the couple is divorced civil and madly in love with their daughter But there is some tension and some emotional issues It seems that dads paying and mom is consciouslyunconsciously using that to drive up the purchases Shes treating me like a makeup guru and every time I even touch a product its purchased It was like something out of a game show shopping spreewith the piles of makeup up and cleansers building a metropolis at the register Im having candid camera moments pinching myself occasionally to see if this is real But Im drawing the boundaries when suddenly I realize that its going too farafter she began asking about whether we should add antiwrinkle and cellulite creamssome of our most expensive and IMO useless product I put the brakes on I never let people buy those Shes twelve I knew they were going to the mom and besides I told her they dont work anyway By this time they had bought nearly one of everything in the store with the dad seemingly unfazed and the mom and girl giddy as can be It was the most fun Id had in the month Id worked there oh yeahdid I mention that And then it was over to the tune of nearly  not including the makeover Plus many hugs compliments and teary gigglesMy senior consultant had unfortunately not been scheduled to witness the crazy spree but was there the next day when my manager came in on his day off to award me an additional bonus and certificate for best individual sale to date I guess I had broken a previously held record by nearly a hundred dollarsThe look on the Srconsultant was pricelessalmost better than the hugs and moneyalmost but not quite So much for working with lowly kids

techiebabe,87,111,1prkmw,385,Needed to let off steam and where better than TFR where you share my frustrationsIt was Saturday afternoon at a large supermarket I had finished my shopping and was trying to drive out of the car parkA woman was pushing her trolley slowly down the road within the car park Straddling the white line so she was blocking both lanes and couldnt easily be passed Never mind I just stayed in my lane and hung back giving her space inching forward at her slow ambling pace Eventually she looked over her shoulder and noticed me She turned round and screeched at me a tirade which I didnt entirely catch but the gist of which was what the hell are you doing I instinctively replied Im drivingShe moved over to one side to shout at me through my drivers window which gave me the space to pull away amp drive offBut honestly What was I doing Giving you space and time to move even though you were ignoring the pavements and if you chose one side of the road OR the other thered be room for both of us I hope she hasnt got kids it would be awful for them to hear her high pitched irrational headbiting rants At least I could tell myself that for whatever reason I was having a better day than her at this pointAaaaaand relax Thanks for letting me rantTLDR Woman gets in my way for a while then notices me and shouts at me for  who knows why,Short rant about fellow shopper shouting at me,496
SilentDis,57,91,1mjzo8,380,This will be a long one  No apologies no regrets  My mind drifts back to these times today because of a post on another subredditThis took place in ye grande olde tymes of   I was  years old and found myself the owner and primary operator of a burger and fries restaurantMy father started it  He took a rundown carhop only driveup order at a speaker or with a person food is brought out to your car AampW and reopened without the corporate branding as an independent  He was quite successful and decided to upgrade to a small sitdown placeNew slab attached to what used to be a kitchen in  walls seating for about   if the fire marshal wasnt around couple washrooms and a slight upgrade to the kitchen hanging outlets everything on wheels etc  I helped design the kitchen a little after having some experience in fast food when I was in High School  He ran it as such for about a month and a half and got bored of it  Nothing wrong or anything just wanted to do something elseI had lent him  as a silent partner eBay sniping and relisting computer builds a couple other odd interests here and there while holding a tech support job  It was a business venture plain and simple he got extra funding I got a couple grand a year till I hit k out was the original idea  Between his boredom and me getting fed up with tech support though he offered it to me while hed go silent partner  I had nothing really to lose so I said sureLocation was good  I was  mile from a state bike trail that was popular  I had a High School out my front door and the kids had open campus for lunch  The prices at the  fast food franchise joints were a bit high and the only other place to eat were for the most part bars where they couldnt go anywayI cleaned house rather quickly  He was a bit old mind on a lot of things  His product was mostly prepacked frozen and his supplier was gouging him badly for the privilege  In  months I had reinvented the menu to be much much smaller  I fired the two idiots he had because they were lazy  I introduced a waste control ie fresh soup daily daily specials and purchased some new equipment a flat top that catches fire if you put a burger too close to the edge isnt good dadI hired a cook  This kid was  and looked and was when I hired him a total wreck  A rap sheet in a small rural town in the middle of Wisconsin that included numerous drug offences theft and the big one grand theft auto a bit bullshit that one  A test drive from a used car dealership that went a little awry  To this day I have no fucking idea what went through my head when I hired him but folks impressions are not everything  He really wanted to turn his life around and I am very very honored and proud that he got a damn good start at it while working for me  I also hired only  teenyboppers  Specifically kids from the High School to work my frontofhouseMinimum wage at that time was all of hr  This is entrylevel bullshit  Thats what I should pay right  No  Just no  My cook got hr start at the end he was making hr  The two kids I hired to wipe tables take money and make shakes  Yeah they got hr and instant hr raise after  weeks  I was told multiple times that I was insane for doing such a thingWrong  Way wrong  I admit there was a lot of hireandfire for a while  If you didnt work you were out on your ass without a second glance  But I had a stack of applications in my office a mile high  Every kid in the high school wanted to make that sweet sweet bank and the fast food joints the only other places they could get jobs were stuck on the whole must pay minimum wage mentalityMy interview process kicked a lot of them to the curb  It wasnt the sit down and answer questions variety  Id pull down a lb box of plastic spoons off my high shelf and tell them to put it back  Lift a full mop bucket into the mop sink properly with your legs not your back  Youd be surprised how often these simple physical tasks were either scoffed at or couldnt be completed  It was on the application  You said you could do that  Why did you start right off by lying to meThe big one though was making change in your head  I required every person to touch my till to be able to do basic change in their heads  I didnt care that the register told them mistakes happen and I want their doublecheck  When the bill is  and the customer hands you a  you should be able to tell them the change is  instantly  When they failed and so many did that this is th grade arithmetic at best and theyre in high school I got some tears some attitude but I never ever gave them a jobWhen I did hire I made sure they understood up front what it was we do here  Simply this building and your job exist to make me filthy rich  So wealthy in fact that I would be able to go home and swim in a pool of money just like Scrooge McDuck  Everything we did here would be actions toward that one single goal  Now I am happy to take you along with me provided were in it together  DealI made sure they understood that this was a more business partner deal than just a joejob  It was my life after all  I paid well at the onset and youre damn right I gave regular raises  One kid was making hr before she went and moved out of state for college  Another was making   For a  year old  years ago that was pretty damn good  I may have expected a lot but the way I saw it I better pay for that just as wellAlso no one and I mean no one abused my staff but me   I am a sarcastic sardonic selfdeprecating prick and proud of it  Given the unlimited power granted to me by ownership there were times when Id crank it to  and rip off the knob  Id joke around with abusing my staff and fully expect them to give it back in spades  I assure you I herd some great oneliners at my expense high schoolers are wonderfully cruel I tried very very hard to make a safe fun decent place for both me and my employees to make money at  I like to think I succeeded in that at leastTheres one other thing I must remind you all of  I had dedicated a good  hours a week to this place myself  From the behind the scenes stuff running errands doing bookwork filling out tax forms filing tax forms preparing orders picking up orders tearing my Sysco rep a new asshole because the product I was sent was shit more on that at a later time to general maintenance toilet clogs repairing a table leg reattaching trim to my coolers fixing broken equipment as well as being there constantly to cook clean help staff train staff serve customers Everything  I saw it this way if I didnt do the job in front of my staff how the hell could I expect them to do it right my way  Mind you I didnt work a moment of it I lived for thisWith all that out of the way Ill share a few short moments that stick out that always make me smileMy meal deals were just a sandwich and fries  No drink  This was intentional it encouraged upsales to more profitable items like shakes malts phosphates etc  I didnt make squat on sodas well compared to my profits on a root beer float I didnt  Still cant beat a single handpattied freshneverfrozen burger on a freshmadethatday bun with handcut fries for  plus taxStill idiots would complain and demand a free drink  I would try to educate a few at first it was like telling a toddler they cant have more candy a pointless activity that just drained me  I told my kids to just tell them no politely and ask if theyd like to buy one  Otherwise punt to me that was what I was there forI was cooking one of my employees was serving someone and the lack of drink came up  She did perfect suggested a chocolate phosphate perfectly and even said it was her favorite no lie they are awesome  Made me happy every time to hear that stuff  Nope demanding a free drink because McDonalds programmed them to  Offered again nope more verbal diarrheaSilentDis could you come out here  Im dressed in faded as shit blue jeans a dark teeshirt and a dirtyassin apron  I look nothing like what an owner should look like DMe Yes  Customer I should get a drink with my meal  Me Not here you dont  Prices on the meals are as cheap as they come ever had a raspberry dreamsicle soda  Ill give you a taste if youd like  Customer  Meals always come with sodas you dont know what youre doing I demand your manager  Me  Oh okay hold onI turn to my left  degrees  I turn back around to my right and face her once againMe How can I help you  Customer  YOURE NOT THE MANAGER i WANT THE MANAGER RIGHT NOW  Me  Im the manager would you prefer the owner  Fair warning the guys a bit of a dick though  Customer  HOW DARE YOU TALK LIKE THAT I DEMAND TO TALK TO HIM NOW  Me  Alright he wont be happy thoughThis time I turn  in placeMe  Get the fuck out of my storeAnother similar free drink customer was in and one of my fronthouse girls took it upon herself  I was seconds from coming off my line and dealing with it I could hear everything and knew where the conversation was going when she stated plainly Wow last time I got that worked up was over wanting a pony  I was   It broke me I was in tears laughing very loudly and Im certain the customer herd  Red and still crying I rounded the corner to see the customer storm out the doorAfter I was able to talk again I asked her to please just let me have my fun with them next time but that was fucking hilarious,Tales From The Shack   On Ownership of a

neomety,112,155,1ik0pb,385,Edit Tale number five is here httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsilfctalesfromthegaybarthepowderpuffortheres it is finally the much anticipated tale of the Powder PuffChapters one httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsihfemtalesfromthegaybar Two httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsihxuqtalefromthegaybarthebabydykesorasmall And Three httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsiilhytalesfromthegaybartheblueboobedgirlorFirst of I want you all to understand something very important I want you all to understand how wonderful you are All of you I have posted three stories so far and I have not received a single negative comment Do you know how rare that is To find a subreddit where people are nice and civil to each other and where a little sarcasm is not looked down upon as smartassery For that I thank you most humbly Thank you fellow rtalesfromretailers you are a delight and I feel honored that you enjoy reading these stories And secondly I would like to dedicate this story to uencoreunefois as the biggest thank you for the gold I am able to give I want you to remember that when people are horrible they usually get what they deserve Even if it might not seem like it at firstThirdly I realize that there were slightly more votes for the anthropological report on Powder Puffs but it was time I told this story So the Powder Puffs will have to wait but I promise youll get to meet them soonSo here it goes Christina and The SteakOn my very first barshift back in  my shift manager pulled me aside and told me of Christina and The Steak They were well known at the bar for causing trouble and I was to be on the lookout for them  But how will I know what they look like was my in my opinion pretty dignified question My shift manager merely laughed Youll know he said and went back to doing whatever it is shift managers do I didnt give it much more thought I figured if they were violent I could just kick them out simple right WrongA month or so would pass before I got to meet these two delightful characters No delightful is not the word Im looking for I think colourful suits them better yes colourful Christina was in an orange top quite deep in the eh neck region And blue pants that made her ass look about as wide as a barn The steak wore a navy blue shirt with a fire breathing dragon curled around his sizeable beergut Yes colourful is most certainly the word They were both in their midforties and had that kind of look like life has been a bit rough You know the sagging cheeks the eyes that never stay focused on one thing but seem to skid across the room constantly scanning for danger or opportunity the lumbering walk that looks like a bitch female dog you guys about to give birth to the puppies shes been carrying for too longMy shift manager was right I knew The moment I saw them walk through the door I knew How did I know Mainly because of him The Steak was I learned at that moment not just a nickname It was so much more He was The Steak there could be no doubt He was big and tough and meaty he even looked like he was a bit undercooked if you catch my drift He was the embodiment of a steak If a steak and a human mated this would be the result of that I had no doubtChristina was cheery The Steak not so much They sat down at the bar and he ordered a beer she perused the drinks menu Unsatisfied with the general selection she asked if I would make her something sweet And then she winked I thought Id imagined it or that it was involuntary but I now know it was most definitely voluntary and I most certainly did not imagine it However I chose to ignore it misjudgment on my part Im sorry to say I made some drink I cant even remember which but then again the sickly sweet drinks have never been my cup of tea She praised the drink I thanked her and moved on to a customer and his GnT squeeze of lemon darling I went through the motions Glass Ice Which Gin would you like Sneak a peek at him loose wrists styled hair skintight clothes eyeliner Hell have Bombay Bombay darling Jigger Gin Tonic Knife Lemon Squeeze Straw There you are Thatll be  if youd be so kind Card Terminal Register DING Receipt Pen Signature Thank you darling Short break Read the above paragraph again but this time with your most stereotypical gay man accent when you read his lines its okay we wont judge you much It just adds so much more flesh to the character right Okay back to the barOnce done with GnT squeeze of lemon darling I cleaned up wiped down the bar and then did the patient bartender spiel Your bartender does this too Its an act you put on you stand around doing your best to not look bored when there are no customers but in your mind you are either rehearsing the lyrics to We Didnt Start the Fire trying to remember what you had for breakfast or if you are a dutiful employee practicing different drinks in your head So there I was silently in my head going Harry Truman Doris Day Red China Johnny Ray South Pacific Walter Winchell Joe DiMa This drink is reeeeeally good Her screeching voice cut me of halfway through the first verse I look over and see her greedily suck the last drops through the straw It makes that sound that you can in no way reproduce in writing yet we all know it well The sound of air and liquid being drawn through a slim tube on to a waiting tongue The sound of slurpees and kids birthdays The sound of movie theatres and unrelenting angerShe pulls out the straw and licks the last drops off of it Her muchtored lipstick is smeared on her teeth She pushes her glass across the bar and asks will you make me something like this sweet but with a bit of a bite to it and there it is again That wink This time Im sure She winked at me But Im not the only one who saw The Steak did too He shoots me this look Ive never seen its like It was a sigh mixed with anger and regret and just a touch of resignation All this in one look I was a bit blown away honestly but I collected myself and made some random drink Sweet with a bite just like she askedAgain she praised the drink and gulped it down quicker than a  year old when told he cant have that cookie This time she asked for something sweet and sexy How is a drink sexy I know some drinks have sexy names like sex on the beach or one night stand but how does a drink taste sexy I asked if there was anything on the menu she thought looked good she shook her head no they look so simple and boring I like what you do better Wink You know what lady Screw you and your sexy drinks and screw your wink toI made her the simplest drink I could think of A screwdriver Glass Ice Jigger Vodka Orange juice and then the twist I added another ingredient it colours so violently so I only used a drop there was no way she could taste it Blue Curacao straw stir serve Which colour does blue and yellow make Green How many drinks can you come up with that are green Me Im a bartender I can think of a few But this woman this Christina Ill bet you my favorite shaker she had never seen a green drink before She went nuts Bonkers Mad Completely frigging deranged Over a drink you guys The most basic of drinks the one I teach new bartenders first to explain the basics of drink making or mixology if you insist A screwdriver with a bit of colour mixed in and she was off her head It was the best drink she had EVER had and I was just amazing and beautiful and talented andandand I think she creamed her pants right on the spot but no matter for this is where the story takes a slight turnThe Steak long overlooked and forgotten in the ecstasy his wife was living through her superb green screwdriver got up He didnt say a word he just got to his feet drained his beer bottle leaned slightly over the bar and CRASH He brought the bottle  down holding it by the neck on the edge of the bartop and it smashed leaving him a nice little stab weaponStill not saying a word in the now completely silent bar he looked at me looked at his wife lifted the bottle neck with the jagged edges glinting in the dim lights he grunted at me in a manner I can only assume was to convey you get what Im hinting at I nodded just at short curt nod of acquiescence That was enough he sat back down pushed the bottle neck across the bar to me and motioned for another beer I was not happy with the situation but at least the immediate danger was averted or so I thought I was wrongIn my mind I quickly calculated how long till closing half an hour  minutes I could manage that no need to make any more out of the situation right Again I was wrong This must go down in history as The Night Neomety was Wrong The steak and I had made a silent agreement none more would come of this we had marked up the borders of our respective countries Mine was Barghanistan his Guestran We shared a border but I would not invade his capitol Christran Tehstina okay Guestran was bad enough I cant come up with a good pun on Tehran and Christina sorryhis capitol Christina and he would not drop a beer bottle shaped atom bomb on me The peace treaty had been drawn up all that was left was to sign it and we could enjoy peace in our time Historians and people with a bit of knowledge of World War II will see the danger ahead because when Neville Chamberlain said Peace in our time what did eventually come to pass Well not peace thats for sure and the same happened here There was a Yoko Ono among us a nagging little bitch who would not give peace a chance A lipstick smeared teethed orange shirted blue pantsed ass as wide as the Rio Grande little devil who decided this was her time to shineGoddamned maximum of  characters The last part will have to be in the comments Im really sorry about that I didnt mean

madeofstarlight,85,76,1i5ubv,385,I worked at a retail store catering mostly to older conservative women We sold your everyday bra and panties We had a stupid policy that as long as you had a receipt or if your item had the original tag we would take it back It didnt matter if it had been worn  times or if it was  years old We also had a special going on  bras for some amount a piece not counting clearance or specialmarked items All the signs are clearly marked This woman comes in and heads to my counter I ask if I can help her and she hands me a bag and says she has a return but wants to shop I tell her no problem I can process the return at the same time as her purchase She goes somewhere in the store and a CA is helping her I open the bag and this pungent smell of BO exists the bag I pull out the bra It at one point was white but now looked grey and cornflower blue had broken underwires and had that feeling of sweathad been sitting in the car for months No receipt but theres a tag without a price I type in the UPC and it tells me that the bra is now only worth  The bra is from  when I catalog it This customer was awful She tried on no less than  bras several of which were the same style and size but were different colors She got makeup and deodorant stains on the dark colored ones which we have to damage because they cant be resold She questioned the price on every item even though the sale had been explained to her repeatedly Her total store time was over an hour She comes back up to the desk and decides she wants her return purchase and regular purchase to be separate I give her additional items to my CA who I was training I process her return which comes to  She asks Why am I only getting  back for this item It was  when I bought it and I just bought it a few months agoI say Maam this is now a clearance bra and I cant give you the original price because it is not listed on the tag and you have no receipt and she cuts me off But I came in  months ago and it was  I reply Maam this bra is  years old The style number is one I dont have in books from  years ago and I have been here  years and we havent sold anything for  since  She stares at me for what feels like an hour Cant you just take my word for it I tell her sorry theres nothing I can do So she takes her  and disappears in the store again and comes to the CAs register shortly after She comes up with two promotion bras and a clearance bra The clearance bra will already be half off CA explains to her three times that the promotion wont work on two only three and the third she picked was clearance She exclaims This one was on the rack with these other ones I found CA explains that it clearly red marked and it must have been put there by mistake Customer gets very angry at this point You are trying to rip me off I know you can give me the price I want but you are selfishMy CA looks at me and asks what to do I told her Just give her the promo on the other two I am tired of hearing her mouth The customer shuts up after that CA finalizes her purchase The customer looks up and says I had a  off coupon I dont have it with me but can you look it up or use another one I am so livid Maam the coupon is tied to your reward card but unfortunately I have no way to look up your information Customer again throws a fit WHY CANT YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR IT I COME HERE ALL THE TIME She snatches her bag off the counter I stop her at the door and hand her the bag of the nasty bra Take this with you This is something I can call OSHA over and I do not want to subject my employees to touching decadeold filth She grabbed it and ran out of the store Never to return on my shifts anyway  ,Cant You Just Take MY Word For It,461

ravencrowe,91,101,1ikfmt,386,Last summer I worked as a waitress at a fairly nice restaurant that served breakfast lunch and dinner The layout of the restaurant is simple its basically one big room with windows that overlook a lake on the far end People always want to sit at the stupid lake windowsOne weekday afternoon I was working the lunch shift It was fairly quiet as usual when in walks this yearold Barbie doll She had bleach blond hair done up like she was auditioning for Hairspray turquoise eyes color contacts I assume with matching eyeshadow and was as thin as a cancer patient She clacks in on her high heels taking those tiny beauty pageant steps while swinging her hips back and forth walks right into the center of the room and loudly asks Can we sit anywhere we wantNow our restaurant was not seat yourself Typically people would wait at the hostess stand like you normally do and one of us would come seat you This was important because it ensured that the customers were fairly distributed among each of our sections That and we would also bring menus with us when we seated people so no one ever had to wait for a menu this is important However if customers asked for a specific booth or table we would put them there This got really annoying because people would always request the lake windows which meant whoever was assigned to that section got way more customers and way more money than anyone else Anyway I digress Since we would have put them wherever they asked anyway one of the waitresses said Uh sure I guess and Barbie strutted over to a lake window boothA few minutes later in walks Barbie  Obviously her sister twin she looked exactly the same except that her hair was cemented into a slightly different but equally big hairstyle and her eyeseyeshadow were violet instead of turquoise Now the lucky waitress assigned to the lake windows today was Holly Holly was everything the Barbies were trying to be she was  but looked about  cute thin naturally blond and just overall really pretty She brought the Barbies their coffee and as far as I could tell she didnt say anything more than How are you doing today to themAs soon as Holly left their table Barbie  approached meExcuse me she said I dont mean to be rude but we simply refuse to be served by that blond waitressIm sorry I said but shes assigned to the table your at today Is there a reason why she cant serve youWe just do not want her serving us she exclaimed SighOK Ill see what I can do I found Holly in the waitress station and told her that the Barbies had rejected her Holly laughed and said she didnt care she didnt want to serve them anyway This is when I found out that the Barbies are apparently notorious in the town my restaurant is in for their bad attitude and major middleaged sluttiness Apparently they always refuse to be served by waitresses who are younger and prettier than them I was OK to serve them though Thanks I guess I offered to take care of them because I was intrigued and figured I could get a good story to tell my friends about the time I served The Whores of Town Name as my coworker Laura called themI went to their table and told them that I would be serving them As soon as I got there one of them said Excuse me but we need some menus That blond waitress forgot to bring us any Can you believe that Bitch maybe thats because you decided to seat yourself I put on my best customer service smile and brought them some menus The rest of the meal proceeded with them just generally being really demanding pulling stupid power trips like asking me to bring extra extra extra cream and then not using any of it The icing on the cake though was when they called me over to apologizeI hope that blond waitress isnt offended that we didnt want her serving us Barbie  saidOh no I said with a giant smile on my face not at all Dont worry about itIts just we dont want people talking about us is all said Barbie  Barbie  nodded in solemn agreementI reassured them that no feelings were hurt and no one would be talking about them Then I went to the waitress station where Holly and Laura and I talked about them for the rest of the day,Middleaged Barbies cant be served by any waitress who is more attractive than them,487

TenthDoctor,47,87,1ekmo4,382,So I thought Id submit something here for once something that happened a few months ago I work at a Petrol Station which also has a supermarket section to itSo there I am working the closing shift A few customers every now and then having to stock shelves and fridges between customersIn walks a customer who heads straight for our gift card stand Grabs about  of them and heads to the front counter and asks to buy them Im a little bit suspicious by this point as we usually only sell  or  at a time I think to myself that if he is paying cash I wouldnt have much of an issue except making sure the cash is not counterfeitThe guy then pulls out one of the company cards that we have for business accounts Alarm bells go off in my head and Im thinking What should I do We never have sold gift cards on business accounts and wondering how the guy will react if I deny the saleI excuse myself to check for authorisation and head to the office The guy decides to tell me he bought  earlier in the day with no issues I then decide to call my boss and try to hint to them that it is a potential fraud situation without letting the customer knowI told my boss that I had   gift cards to sell on a business account and that I needed authorisation for the transaction Thankfully they pick up on it straight away and ask me a few yes or no questions do you suspect this to be fraud are they regular customers etc and told me to deny the sale and mention they can call Accounts in the morning if they have any problems and to call my boss back after they leaveThey get a bit annoyed but leave without further issues I called my boss back and we discussed the probability of it being fraud whether they really purchased  earlier they did and one of my coworkers got into trouble for not picking up on the potential fraud gtlt and told me to fill out a report for itI get a call the next day from my boss I am told that the guy is the son of the owner of the business the account is linked to and that he was buying the gift cards on his dads business account then selling them for cash to fuel his drug habit Got a little certificate for being attentive to potential fraud and got a free scratchie from one of the higherups a simple incentive kind of thingTLDR Just read it it isnt that long PPS I didnt win anything on the scratchie ,Attempted fraud,469

TheJanks,43,73,1n4tez,381,Im not just an employee Im partowner of a family business We sell plants to other businesses or landscapers Its not a normal product on a shelf but a living product that demands special attention Being family I am not bound to suffer fools I go out of my way to be a good vendor but as we all know some customers just live to take advantage of this and be horrible people Well I had a bad apple today and thought Id share Customer placed an order and assumed he had a credit account When told he didnt he emailed the letter I wrote in January that spelled out his credit terms I gave him I sent it back highlighting the last three sentences that clearly stated  he already had an invoice out as of today  the due date of said invoice and  the statement payment needs to be made on time else his credit status would be revoked immediately I also sent him a copy of the check stub and envelope that was received TWO weeks past the due date for said invoice I also wrote quite a bit more a bit snarky actually but this is the condensed version for reddit The reply I got from him was what I expected I wrote that check on the due date per your terms Mailing it later is a legal loophole Im entitled to The credit account is a contract that we have because you gave it to me IN WRITING And thats why I saved the envelope for  months  he is not the first person who thinks I would go Oh snap legal loophole I must send you my product nowSince I already called him out on this bullshit and more in the letter I sent him I told him he doesnt have credit nor am I in a legal position to give him credit and Ill respectfully request prepayment for all orders for now on He didnt ask for how long which is sad because I have my standard answer Ive used in the past for when customers push all the wrong buttons trying to scam cheat or take advantage of us That answer is Till the sun goes supernova scorching the Earth and eradicating all forms of life from its surface This is better than the alternative time period which is indefinitely so you cant say Im not unreasonable The above policy was first used about  years ago customer who came to our place of business driving a brand new Lexus with the tempplates still on it We refused to load the plants into her car simply because it was a brand new Lexus and I would not be blamed for the damage caused to it by our plants She was welcome to go get a pickup truck OR load the plants herself She loaded the plants herself Then the following day threatened to take us to small claims court if we refused to pay for the detail work needed to clean up the damage from the dirt and water that leaked from the buckets  We told her that was her decision but we would never sell to her again now because we dont appreciate being threatened with lawsuits after doing our best to prevent that damage She did not like the term indefinitely so I made up the whole bit about the sun going supernova on the spotand its stuck Hmm Another oneCustomer had credit status for years was a great customer One bad year came up and he decided to stock up heavy on product in hopes it would all move and he could make some money back It did not move  and he did not pay us We took legal action in small claims court and made it clear that if we would represent ourselves keep the lawyers out of it it would save us BOTH money because lets face it he doesnt have a case He got a lawyer So sadly we had to get a lawyer We won the case and he had to pay our lawyer fees He ended up having to owe his lawyer and our lawyer more money than what he owed us  When he mailed us the last payment for it all he did have a sticky note affixed to the check I am sorry I was an idiot  should not have hired a lawyer I was happy he said that We still sell to himbut payment up front Another customer like the one above   we won a judgement in small claims court but as some of you may know getting someone to pay is tough With a legal background check I was able to find all his assets and discovered he has a very nice boat on a lake  miles from  us We went to the sheriffs office with our judgement told them about the boat and  hours later the boat was being pulled out of the water on a trailer on loan from the sheriffs department to be locked up in hopes that we would get cash instead of the boat   The customerwas livid as hell We went back to court and he had the audacity to tell the judge we could not take assets that would diminish his business income as per legal rights The judge asked him why he needed a boat to which he said I do landscaping for customers that have property lakeside and take them out on my boat to show them what it looks like from the lake  The Judge had a very good laugh and said not good enough A check was cut  hour later Customer came in and bought plants Complained a week later they were the wrong cultivar one is upright one grows sideways and he wants a refund I told him thats not possible as we only had one type in stock for the past  years  the other simply has not been on this property in  years He argued left and right and even sent us a fuzzy picture of it  I plugged the picture into a program and got GPS coordinates of it   miles away Hopped in my truck and drove out there and called him while standing in the yard Told him that theres characteristics of this plant in the leaves and flowers and this is CLEARLY the plant he originally ordered I then sent him pictures of it and found our original plant label on one of them specifying the cultivar He has no damn clue how I found that house was very angry and promised never to come back after this poor customer service We see him once a week still Ok Ill stop here ,We have a contract IN WRITING and other tidbits,454

spedmonkey,59,57,1b3ari,377,Since hours got cut after the holidays I usually work one night per week at a certain national chain corner drug store About six months ago we introduced a new rewards card that you need to have in order to get our sale prices Its also corporate policy that we dont have store cards available if customers dont want to sign up for one For most customers it isnt a problem and theyll either sign up or just pay full price but every once in awhile we get someone stubborn who demands to speak to a manager who invariably tells them that theres nothing they can do This usually shuts up the customer who either pays or leaves UsuallyThen of course theres this lady An older woman probably about  or so she first came in a few months ago about an hour before closing and brought a pack of toilet paper some chips and a few other sundries up to my register We chat normally as I ring up her items then ask if she has a rewards card with us I dont she says I tell her our store policy and she just stares at me After literally about  seconds of this she asks me to get the manager I do soHe comes up she asks him to override the policy He explains that he cant its store policy it only takes about a minute to sign up for a card and shell be able to use it every time she comes back in the future She gives him the same  second stare then says this is price discrimination and Im going to call the police on you and your anal retentive employee here meWe both look at her in disbelieving shock then both simultaneously try to explain that the police wont do anything because theres nothing illegal going on She cuts us off and demands the name of the stores general manager who well call Mary My manager tells her and tells her shell be welcome to come in or call tomorrow and talk to Mary about our policyNot Good Enough She demands Marys home number so she can call her right now nearly  PM by this point My manager refuses naturally She demands it again This goes on for an absurd amount of time until before we know it its five minutes until closing time Finally my manager throws up his hands and tells her that we need to close so hell price modify her purchase to the sale prices this once but that she shouldnt expect to be able to do this again I change the prices as she glares at me then she pays all of this in silence She grabs her bags and as she walks out the door says thank you SO MUCH for your help you two Ill make sure to call Mary tomorrow and let her know what a good job you did being Nazis My manager and I both agree that were going to close as quickly as possible and go to our respective homes to drink heavilyFast forward to the next weekend and wouldnt you know it about an hour before closing in walks the same customer I recognize her immediately and immediately call the manager on duty a different one than last time to warn him that his services are probably going to be needed She walks up and pretends not to recognize me I ring up her stuff then with a mental sigh ask her for her rewards card She starts the  second stare and halfway through I say why dont I just call the manager now and save us both the trouble Before she can answer I grab the phone and page him up to the front While we wait for him to come she says I dont understand why youre being so disrespectful I hope you know that youre being extremely rude to me already and I dont appreciate your terrible attitude As I bite off my retort the manager comes and since Ive already briefed him he knows what to expect The lady goes through the same price discrimination spiel the manager pulls out our store policy which he had grabbed as soon as I had talked to him and quotes the relevant passages verbatim to her Once again this continues for an excruciatingly long time as she drops Marys name repeatedly and tells the manager that Mary had told her personally that she was allowed to be the one exception to the policy My manager tells her in the most polite terms possible that this is clearly not true she asks if hes calling her a liar and so it continues Finally it once again is about five minutes til closing time so he tells her that hes not playing games with her anymore and shes not going to get the sale prices this time She stands there her mouth agape and huffily decides to pay full price about  more than the sale prices Naturally she cant leave without a parting shot and tells us that were both racists and generally scummy people and that this time shes calling Mary for real to tell her about it We just shake our headsSeveral months pass and I dont see her again until last weekend Same deal  an hour before closing she comes in We have a new manager and its her first night ever closing alone I call her and apologize profusely for whats about to happen and I can hear her facepalm over the phoneThe customer comes up and once again pretends not to recognize me I politely ring up her stuff and ask her for her card She gives me the stare Look I tell her our policy hasnt changed since the last time you came in here You can either sign up for the card or pay full price She demands to see the manager As a lastditch effort I tell her Look Ill call her but seriously nothing has changed Its just going to waste the time of all three of us She gives me the stare again I call the manager WhateverAs we wait for her to come up she tells me I think Im starting to dislike you sir I respond by telling her that shes disliked me for awhile now She acts all offended saying that shes never seen me before in her life I remind her that shes called me an anal retentive scummy Nazi racist She insists that Im lying and says that I have a terrible attitude again I tell her with all the disdain I can inject into my voice that Im sorry she feels that wayThe manager comes up and the customer launches into her usual routine The manager cuts her off after about five minutes and tells her Look I just talked to Mary this morning She mentioned you specifically as an example of how we cant change our policy Further you cant insult me and my employees here So you have three choices here you can sign up for the card you can pay full price or you can leave End of discussion She walks offThe customer is left speechless Finally she mutters under her breath for a bit then tells me that shell sign up for the card She gives me obviously fake information like that her birthday is in  Whatever I dont care enough at this point to call her on it I scan the card and lo and behold none of her items are on sale meaning she saved no money at all Shes flabbergasted and tries to argue but I pull out our weekly ad and point out that none of her things are in it I cant help but smirk at her and she tells me that Ive completely humiliated her and shes going to complain about our entire store from Mary down to me to our CEO himself She then storms out and my manager immediately walks back up to the front from behind a shelf where she was observing highfives me and tells me to go take an extra break because fuck that bitch Maybe its a petty victory but Ill happily take it,I take my small victories where I can get them,434
warpedgurl,42,64,18r6cy,377,This happened years ago when I was working at a huge box store that starts with a W and ends with a Mart So I was working at the customer service desk It was about pm the store was open until midnight I was closing down the customer service desk as usual This lady come in with a shopping cart that is covered with a blanket I ask her how I can help her She proceeds to tell me she had purchased an automatic kitty litter box and that it wasnt working correctly She proceeds to lift the blanket off the cart In the cart is an automatic kitty litter box full of cat shit and piss Then the smell hit me My nose was burning from the smell of ammonia  I asked her to put the blanket back over the cart and she started yelling at me because the litter box would no longer push the clumps into the container and that her house smelled like that for weeks now I looked at her and said did you have it plugged in she looked at me like I has spouted a second head After about  minutes of going back and forth about the nasty litter box I asked her if she had a receipt No I aint got the damned receipt I asked her if she had the box Why would I keep a box that it came in I then told her I could not do the return I asked her to take the nasty litter box back outside with her She took the blanket off the cart picked up the litter box and dumped it on the floor in front of the service then and I shit you not she got down on her hands and knees and started rubbing it around on the floor with her hands and meowing like a cat I called management and they escorted her out of the store I quit about  weeks later when I found out she came back in on a night I wasnt working and they let her return the nasty litter box edit words,You want to return what,441

RedRing,45,85,1px2uj,374,Hello again TFR  Im sorry I missed you over the weekend and by doing that I might have upset some people I promised a theft story to  So today I rectify that with the theft story that was promisedThis one just as the other  I am working at the game store that I loved  Let us first set up the fun fact of at this time the store wasnt as staffed as it should have been for the holidays  I didnt like hiring holiday workers because they just didnt seem to work out well and it wasnt fair to them in some ways but thats neither here nor there  Now the downside to that was that it caused me to work at lot more  For about  months I worked everyday and a lot most of those days I pulled open to close shifts so that my guys had cover  I didnt mind the shifts at all though as it was a blast  If you love your job you never work a day in your life  I loved being there and even worked whenever I went home trying to find things to make the store better  However eventually it does begin to wear on youSo we fast forward to January and Im going to have my first day off since October  My guys knew that I was not to be bothered unless the world was going to collapse into a black hole  I close down the shop for the last day of my stretch getting out of there at around   I locked the store up and went home getting ready to lay in my bed and not get up for a long time as I put my day back as being a late close shift  Get home at around  and fall asleep by  which normally I cant do  Suddenly at around  am I am woke up by my phone  I recognize the number as the district manager  I answer the phone and know its going to be something I will hate hearing  He informs me that someone has broken into the store and the police need someone to come down and of course that meant me  I get dressed and go to the store using very colorful language to the nice person who broke inThe guy managed to steal a bunch of games consoles movies and snacks from the store and rental place connected to it  He completely destroyed the store in the process of it to  You would have thought a bunch of frightened dear had been let loose in there  The nice thing was that he also decided to bleed all over the store because he cut his stomach pretty bad on the top of the fence that separated our stores  I stood around as the police did their final sweep and answered a bunch of super fun questions from the officer then went home and fell asleep probably around The next morning at  I get a frantic call from my opener saying someone broke in  Apparently he didnt get my text message or anything  Told him we already knew and he went on to continue working  Noon rolls around and my dm calls to let me know they didnt get anything that was really useful but the guy who robbed us also robbed the grocery store near by for alcohol and ace bandages  Fast forward a week and we have decided we were just sol when it came to the merchandise  While doing some video editing on my laptop for a promo video I hear a ruckus outside the store  I look out and a woman who is probably in her late s  and maybe  pounds is screaming at the car  Suddenly she goes to the passenger door and rips it open to yell at the guy in the seat  She yanks her  year old  lb son out of the car by the ear and drags him into the store  We will call her AM for angry mom He will go by T for thief  I will be playing the role of myself and my costar will be OSM for other store managerAM Well get on with it lets get this doneT No mom please through tearsAM You made a mans decision now be a manT Im so sorry mom I love youMe Mam can IT IM SORRY I STOLE FROM YOU GUYSMe UmAM Boy you better do better than thatT It was me I robbed you guys Im so so sorry  Please dont call the cops  Im really sorry  You can have the games back I brought them He had a trashbag of our stuff but at this point Im trying not to laughOSM We have to call the policeT OH GOD NO  MOM PLEASE HELPAM No  You decided to do this so you will face the consequencesHe continued to beg as we dialed   He tried to get up and move towards the door but his mom got in the way of him and smacked him until he crumpled  The cops came and arrested him  When they entered the mom turned over the gun he used to rob the grocery store  TLDR Store is robbed and a the criminal faces justice,The best way to spend a day off,459

DrunkenBlackBelt,92,108,17k8ms,380,Hello one and all Recently Ive been receiving a lot of messages asking for tales from my days as a security guard at the two amusement parks I worked at and my time working in a psych hospital  I would love to tell these tales but dont know an appropriate subreddit yet So for now Ill stick with my LP stories here which as sadly starting to dwindle  But todays tale is about two mischievous young scamps and their quest to acquire some video games without paying for themIt was a slow hazy afternoon in my part of the country  I was working for a blue shirted electronic retailer and having a bad day  See in the summer time I dont like AC Id rather drive with the windows and sunroof open enjoying the air  So I tended to keep my windows and sunroof cracked open a bit when I parked for long periods  This afternoon mother nature decided to take a shit on me and it rained for all of  minutes with a torrential downpour  Naturally by the time I got relief from my station and my car keys the rain had abated leaving me with a slightly soaked car interior a shit ton of humidity and a bright shining sun that seemed to be a giant middle finger right in my faceSo naturally I was looking to improve my mood  Well I must have done something right in a past life because my opportunity presented itself shortly after  Being a slow day I was following the few customers in the store not really paying attention to them if Im being honest  But when I switched to the camera that watched the video game aisles  I noticed two young kids with a stack of games in their hands  They werent too old maybe  and   Obviously brothers and from the way they were whispering to each other and darting glances around the store it was obvious they were up to something Most of you I am sure are aware that most games in these stores have plastic security cases around them supposedly to deter thieves  Though Ive seen them removed easier than a repressed catholic school girls panties during her first week of collegeAnyways next to the regular secure games is usually a bargain rack or bin  Cheap  and  games usually pretty shitty  But sometimes you can find some gems in there  Well these boys had searched and found a few apparently Each kid had about  or  games in his hand I watched them move to a remote corner of the store and begin to unwrap the games  Hands shaking they removed the plastic and stashed it in a laptop bag  They quickly peeked inside of the game case verifying their treasure was indeed inside  Once the first game was free from is cellophane prison the boys quickly liberated the rest of the games  Each case getting stripped of its binding quicker Their hands learning and becoming more deft with each progression  It reminded me of learning as a younger man to remove a womans bra with one hand  First time is always a fucking disaster an impenetrable Fort Knox protecting those glorious mounds that feel like a bag of sand But soon you learn and its almost as easy as snapping your finger like a reject back up from West Side StoryAt this point I made everyone with a radio aware of what was going on but told them we were just going to fuck with these kids  I had the computer supervisor walk over to the aisle they were in  The two young lads scampered off as soon as they saw the blue movement of a scratchy polo being warn by some one making minimum wage  Next stop was apparently appliances  I could see the two young men conversing in hushed tonesWhy brother said Boy  It seems to me without much forethought that we could stash the wrappings of our contraband in this here refrigeration box  Then we can take this disk containing games of video back to our domicile and spend many an hour together rejoicing in our conquestSplendid cried Boy  Let us at once good sirWell at least thats how they sounded in my head  For some reason they decided to throw the case AND THE GAME in the fridge They did this not once but  times  Then they wandered off to the music section and watched the appliance aisle  My guess is they wanted to see how often people checked before actually removing the games from the cases  And this is where things get interestingAn older black woman walks up behind them  She apparently scared the crap out of them and they all began to talk Now this woman seemed like she had just gotten back from church  She looked like an extra from Big Mommas house One of those little old ladies who stops to talk to Martin Lawrence and then isnt seen again  She was pointing at the games remaining in their hand and shaking her head no  She led them over to the video game aisle to have them put them back on the shelves  With a forlorn glance at the appliance aisle they followed dutifully  That is when the fuckery began on my part  I had our appliance manager go to the three fridges containing games and remove the disks from the cases and leave the cases in the fridges  She brought the disks over to me and I smiled a devious smile like a guy who is stuck in an crowded elevator with the boss he hates and releases a smelly yet silent fart of quiet revengeEventually released from authoritative grip of their grandmother the two boys return to the appliance section and begin to go for their main target  I wish I could accurately describe the look on their faces as they opened the Fridgidaire reached in to open the game case only to discover its empty  A look of pure joy  slowly morphing into a look of utter complexity  I imagine its like being handed your child after your wife gives birth only to discover that it has both sets of genitalia on itThe boys looked around in a panic and quickly abandoned the cases and walked over to the home theater section  Sitting on two giant leather chairs the two boys held secretive conferences  Clearly the message had been sent and I could rest easy knowing two little shits had been taken down a couple of pegs  But NOPE One of the boys quickly ran back to the game aisle picked up two of the games their grandmother had made them put back and returned to the chair  He removed the two disks and handed them to his brother who quickly place them under the chair  Then the first brother went and put the cases back into the game aisle Naturally I raised the Theater supervisor on the radio and he agreed that an impromptu changing of the furniture in his department was a good idea  So he and the biggest guy in the store proceeded to shift around couches and chairs  Eventually they reached the chairs where the two boys sat  The Supervisor knowing a bit of fuckery himself held down his radio so all could hear the conversationSupe Hey guys were moving furniture would you mind letting us just place these chairs over there  Then you can have them backThe boys shared a glance with each other the horror apparent in their eyes  Yes boys You were stupid before then you went full retardYou never go full retard  Shout out to Robert Downy JrSupe Hey guys cmon itll take two seconds I know they are comfy but Ill make sure you get them backBoy  Umm Our grandma told us to wait here We arent allowed to moveSupe Ill tell her I okd it  Or stand here and well bring a couch over for youThe two boys got up and STOOD THERE as the supervisor picked up the chair spotted the two games and picked them up after putting the chair downSupe Oh hey these werent yours were they Fell out of your pocket  No Sorry we get people trying to steal this stuff all the time  someone must have left it here The two boys acted suprised as if anyone would actually steal  That was just unthinkable and wrong  They decided then that an area that had been host to criminals was surely no place that they wanted to be lest they tarnish their purity and quickly left the area  At this point everyone on the radio is laughing or trying not to laugh while dealing with customers  My manager comes up and I tell him Im gonna make sure they understand He gives a nod and goes out and gets all the games and cases and brings them up to me  Now the boys didnt remove anything from the store so legally I wasnt allowed to do what I did next But fuck them Im awesomeAfter several more minutes the boys find their grandmother who had just finished her purchases and they head towards the door I ask the sweet old lady for her receipt and ask her if she has a minute  She says yes and I pull her aside with her two rapscallions in tow  Me Mam are these your grandsonsMadea Why yes they are Is there a problemMe Well Mam I apologize if this seems rude but it appears they were attempting to remove some video games from the store without purchasing themMadea What How dare you accuse them of stealing  We just got back from church  These are good boysMe Im sure they are  And I dont normally say anything or act unless they have removed something from the store but I figured this is something youd want to know about  If you dont believe me I have it all on video and can show you so you can talk to themAfter much hooting and hollering about how Im racist and its hard enough for young black boys growing up without the white man putting them down she agrees to watch the video  She sees everything unfold and the stare she gave her boys would make Hitler hug a Jew just to make it stop  She turned to me apologized profusely and assured me she would take care of it  At this point we were in my office and she asks if she can have a moment alone with her grandsons  I agreed and closed the door behind me  The smacks were audible even though she was screaming at them full force A minute later the ruckus died and they walked out quietly into the sweltering dayTLDRAint no justice like angry black woman justiceEdit They did not shit the furniture

shift manager both at the bar and parties then on to further fame as a manager of the bar and in the end I moved on to being in charge of planning and hosting the parties It was a swift climb through

Tennessee in Scotland NO So dont call it a scotchBut this guy INSISTS on saying a double scotch and coke And every time I ask him Jack Daniels and he reples yesI have tried to explain kindly jokingly even slightly annoyed but it doesnt work So one day when he wasnt looking I made his drink with actual scotch and he actually did a spittake I have never seen anyone else do that ever But he did it and he looked at me with disbelief and tears in his eyes and choked out This cokes gone bad Sigh That was a couple of regulars I have many more if you would like to hear about themNow for the types I would very much like to tell you about a specific type of people The straight guys or the lads The straight guys are a group of  guys out on the town Theyre at the sports bar around the corner and have already had a few rounds As they are sitting there talking up their egos by counting just how many girls theyve banged this past week one of them speaks up Lad You know what we should do You fucking know what we should do You know that fag place around the corner yeah We should go there and scare some queersLad Fuck yeah Lets bash some stinking fagsLad Lets do thisSo they drink up and egging each other on almost run out of the sports bar They walk briskly towards the corner but the minute they round it they slow down They begin to think individually that maybe this isnt such a good idea But they cant let their mates know so they keep on walkingIn the end they make it to the door and one of them pushes out his chest and goes for the handle They walk in looking around shyly They have entered a gay bar this is unknown territory and must be surveyed carefully Oh god I hope no one sees me in here thinks one another Oh god I hope no one hits on me and maybe the third lad thinks to himself That guys kinda cuteWhen they have entered the bar there are in my experience three possible outcomes They are aggressive and antagonizing may even end up throwing a punch before they are kicked out They are aggressive and antagonizing until one of them spots the big bowl of free condoms They each grab a handful and leave quickly looking both ways to see no one saw them My personal favorite They are a bit uncomfortable but one of them declares This seems like a nice place and buys a round for his mates They usually sit at the bar and you get a good talk They may even come back once in a while just because they like the atmosphereThere are a million types The bears the powder puffs the faghags the straight girls the baby dykes the alternatives the fazes and so many more

zuizide,31,70,19wtlk,374,Since yesterdays story of my current situation was so well received I decided to share my all time favoriteI lived in a not so great part of town that only had one  gas station for miles so needless to say I frequented that place I kept on running into the owner there in the middle of the night so eventually I asked him why in the world an owner would work overnights He told me that he couldnt find anyone willing to work overnight that didnt rob him blind with free smokes blunts candysnack and drinks beer mostly I offered my services up and told him a little about myself the next night I started with a promise to him I would work EVERY night shift for him from then on He paid me well and with the  hours of OT every week it was a great opportunity for me Within the first month his loss went down over  he claimed I was proud of that and he compensated me wellSo one fine evening I was really slow it was probably about am or so and during the week there really wasnt much activity from am Im standing outside having a smoke when I notice a very large black guy riding a small girls bicycle in my direction It had the pink streamers on the handlebars and everything even a bright pink banana seat It made me laugh at the mere sight of it but I figured he would be coming into the store to buy something so I went in and went behind the counter When he got there he came in and looked at me and said IM ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY He was pretty scary looking to younger me a guy about a foot taller and easily  pounds heavier with about  body fat This guy was pure muscle you could see the definition in his arms along with some veins considering he was wearing a plain white wife beater Instantly though I could tell he was coming down off a crack binge sweaty as hell when it wasnt that hot out eyes darting all over mouth and tongue making erratic movements and kinda foaming a bit so I figured what the hell lets have some fun So I told him So am I man Thats what they pay me for to watch over the money at night He said NO NO NO YOU DONT GET IT MAN IM ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY I said Me too man I just told you thats what Im paid for To collect and count the money for the owner This went on for about  minutes us going back and forth telling each other how we were all about DAT MONEY Eventually he just said AW SHIT NEVERMIND MAN And then he leftThats when it hit me That bastard was trying to rob me So I went out to my car after scanning the parking lot for him and noticing he was riding off on that cute pink bike and grabbed my trusty  from under the seat I put it in the small of my back and covered it with my shirt and headed back inside When I got close to the door I heard HEY HEY MAN so I turned around and there he was again about  feet from me I hurried inside and behind the counter where I put the gun on a ledge under the counter and kept my hand close to it He comes in the store and says DID YOU CALL DEM BOYS So I played dumb and said What boys man What is wrong with you He said DA PO LICE DID YOU CALL EM I just looked at him and said Why the hell would I call the police Thats when he said Well I wanted da money and you wouldnt give it up so I figgaed you called dem boys on me I just looked at him and said Seriously you were trying to rob me I didnt even realize The next thing shocked the shit out of me because by now I was trying to deal with the fact that I would probably have to shoot someone that night and I really didnt want to Im sorry man I just need to get like  or so I REALLY NEED IT I told him I was sorry that I couldnt help him out with any money but if he wanted someone to chill with while he came down I would sit and talk with him He said ok as long as I didnt call the cops or shoot him apparently he noticed me getting my gun So I left the gun in the store and sat outside with him smoking cigarettes until the urge for more crack wore off During that time he kept on apologizing to me telling me he wasnt like that at all when he was sober and he regretted even trying Although he was shocked that it didnt work At one point he asked me why I wasnt scared of him when he first came in according to him he could have had a gun I told him it was very unlikely that he had a gun because he smokes crack He looked confused and asked what I meant by that so I explained to him If you had a gun at some point you would have traded it for more crack to your dealer instead of using it to rob someone Eventually he told me he was feeling better and not fiending for more crack he hopped on that pink girls bicycle and rode off into the night I never called the cops or told my boss and I never saw him againTLDR I almost got robbed and joked around with the robber and then gave him smokes and company while the urge for more crack subsided,Yo man Im all about dat money,444
Bravesfan,104,88,1mvfv6,375,I had just commented before about only have two weeks left to work at my old store before I had moved to a different one I never told anybody the story of why I put in my two weeks notice though As much crap as I had to sustain while at my job with Mike I liked quite a few of the customers I liked some of the other employees and even though Mike would dictate what I would do for the day normally with lots of yelling once I got my assignment I pretty much did what I wanted while doing my job But what happened in this next story just made me lose it and blow up on Mike like I had never done beforeI was working on a Saturday and we were busy I was running between bagging and service desk I clocked in at  in the morning as a stocker but for some reason this Saturday was like the  days before Thanksgiving massively busy Almost double the sales for any grocery store We have checkers on every lane going as fast as they can As soon as I bag one order Im off to the next register See somebody at the service desk Im off to there nowAbout  in the afternoon my parents come in to do some shopping I say hi and wave to them as Im bagging the order closest to the door They wave say hi and go about their way through the store Im still running back and forth and theres finally a lull in the action I let all four of the checkers know that Im headed out to the parking lot to bring all the carts in and if somebody is needed for the service desk call for a managerI go outside and as expected people have left carts all over the parking lot I grab all the ones from by the building and take those in first I go throughout the parking lot and grab all carts that arent in the cart coral and take those back in to the store Im on my way back out and Im lining up all the carts that are in the coral and I see somebody run up to me out of the corner of my eye I turn around and its one of our checkers They never abandon their registers when its this busy so I know that something is wrongChecker Bravesfan youve gotta come inside quickMe Just lemme get these carts really quick and Ill be in Big rush up frontChecker Not really We had to call a manager up front but Tony the other manager who was in at that time during the day is at lunch so we had to call Mike to the service deskMe Ok Mike can handle the service desk himself I have my own jobChecker Hes blowing up on the customers You better come insideFor those of you who havent read any past stories everybody in our store would bow down to anything that Mike said and nobody would stick up to him Save for two people Myself and Sweetpea our dear sweet office manager I walk back inside furious with Mike I know that he told me he was busy and that I needed to run the front and keep everything in line so that he could do what he was supposed to do I believe it had something to do with orders but its not really importantI see Mike at the service desk laying in to some customers and they both look familiar I see their basket I see the food that theyve bought and I see the mans cane Not just any mans cane No My dads cane Mike is laying in to both of my parents about how hes so important that he cant be bothered to help them and that If Bravesfan wasnt so incapable of doing his job then I wouldnt have to be up here doing this I dont even know why I keep him around Somehow this moron doesnt know that these are my parentsThey just wanted to rent a movie They had everything ready All Mike had to do was scan their card scan the movie grab it and take their money Thats all But no hes yelling at them about how theyre inconveniencing him and that he doesnt see why he should have to deal with people who arent normalFor those of you who dont know my dad has Parkinsons Disease and he has to walk with a cane And apparently walking with a cane makes you not normal I got pissed I dont care if somebody wants to insult me or whatever But I dont care who you are you dont talk bad about my family My mom looks like shes about to cry and my dad looks like somebody had kicked his dog It was on nowMe What did you just say MikeMike Good Youre here Now help themMe No I asked you a question

Hes not normal Now help themMe No First off you narcissistic asshole just because he uses a cane doesnt mean hes not normal Second these are my parents so I cant help them anyway So Im going to let you apologize before I flip a lidMike Ill let you help them this time Now do it I have other stuff to doMe Yeah Ill do it right after I call corporate and let my parents talk to them Youre a prick I wouldnt even care if these werent my parents you dont go around talking to people like that Yeah he uses a cane to walk You know why Because he has Parkinsons Now Im going to tell you one last time Apologize NowMike As he starts heading on his way out from behind the service desk You cant tell me what to do Im your bossMe I walk in front of the entrance behind the counter so that Im blocking his path from getting out Mike has about  inches on me and near  lbs This isnt something that Id win if push came to shove Youre not going anywhere until you apologize And I mean it Mike Do it now or shits gonna get hairy around here and you dont want to be around me when I get that pissedMike Shoves me out of the way Id like to see you do somethingMe Fine Go to the back just wait and see what

to say to youI look at my parents and tell them that Ill bring that movie on my way home and to just go ahead and check outMike and I walk back to the back where our produce manager receiving coordinator and a couple other employees are and I just reached boiling pointMe What the hell is wrong with you My dad is two times the man you are and could ever hope to be I hope you burn in hell you assMike I hope you dont want this job much longer Talking to me like that is a oneway ticket to being firedMe Fine Consider this my two weeks notice You know how many times youve threatened to fire me and never done it Mike Wonder why that is Could it be because I do way more than what is in my job description Is it because I listen to what all the customers actually think of you Is it because I clean up your messes Youre an arrogant son of a bitch why dont you go do us all a favor and go play inside the balorMike Takes a step towards me to try to intimidate me Im too pissed that it doesnt work Why dont you go ahead and try to do something Because you cant Youre weak and youll never be able to do anything about itMe See Mike It goes like this Youll be getting boned by the devil for eternity Like I said this is my two weeks notice Oh by the way Im starting my week of vacation tomorrow Ill come back for my last week but Id like to see how much I actually do Suck my dick Learn some manners and never And I mean never talk to my parents like that again You do that and Ill punch you in the fucking throatI storm out of the back clock out go to the store across town and ask the manager for a job He notices my uniform and asks if I still work over there I said that I just put in my two weeks notice and I couldnt stand working for Mike anymore He tells me that I can start the day after my last day at my old storeI walk back out to my car and notice that I have  calls from the store along with  voicemails I listen to them and theyre all variations of Get back to the store now I went back to the store and got the other manager up to the front to rent me that movieMike walks up front as Im checking the movie out and says that I cant do that on the clockMe Im not on the clock but even if I was on the clock Id do thisI flip him the bird grab my movie and walk out I got home called corporate and demanded to talk to the main boss I leave a message and never heard anything about it I doubt they delivered it to themEven typing this story gets my blood boiling I cant believe that a person can be this much of a dick I apologize for any course language in the post or in any past posts Typing about Mike makes me want to punch something but I have to control my angerHave a great rest of the weekend Reddit,The Final Straw with Mike,463
skunkhairjones,23,79,1foe5n,377,One of the things we install for customers is flooring The process is pretty simple get measured build quote pay carpet is ordered and shipped to the installers installers schedule install Done One of the key components to ensure nothing goes wrong is great follow up and communication with the customers I was always confident my team did an excellent job of doing just thatSo a customer had just gotten measured and paid for a pretty large order for a home Hes being stationed here in the DC area and needed the carpet installed by a certain day before the movers arrived We charge for furniture moving so he saved several hundred dollars by having no furniture Well between the measure time and the sold time he decided to remove a ft wall that divided the room thinking it would have no impact on how the carpet is installed Unfortunately it did have a big impact on how the carpet is laid and how much is needed We had to cancel his original order and for liability and warranty reasons we had to remeasure Now his install date is pushed back closer to his deadline Carpet is reordered and two days later the carpet mill informs us because of the substantial size they didnt have enough carpet from one single dyelot They would have to obtain it from a mill further west Again delaying the install date Only this time it pushed the install date past the date his furniture and rest of his family arrived Apologizing profusely I checked daily for the status of his carpet and would keep him updated He was understandably upset and wasnt sure if he should postpone his movers He couldnt postpone his family arriving though It was cool because he was angry and I guess he had hard time channeling it because he knew it wasnt our fault He remained calm and understanding the entire timeFast forward a week and his carpet is on track to ship as expected That is until the midwest got slammed with super blizzards right where the carpet mill is located Trucks couldnt get in or out At this point I really dont know what to do completely afraid this guy is going to go completely livid I cant contact anyone at the mill because they shut it down due to weather I finally give the customer a call and explain the situation He laughs like he has just gone insane He explains to me he had to pay a fee to postpone his movers and isnt going to postpone them again His family is currently sleeping on air mattresses He is extremely angry but tells me he knows its not mine or my stores fault Everyone at the store has been helpful as could be and he just has shitty luck Its really these types of customers I go completely out of my way for I feel bad they understand that not everything is the stores or the employees fault The entire time he hasnt asked for any compensation because he feels he hasnt been wronged by the store Finally his carpet is dug out of the snow and is headed to the installers Typically an install date isnt scheduled until the installers have the carpet but I tried to pull some strings with our installers to get it done as soon as possible It was a busy season and the installers couldnt fit him anywhere because of the scope of his job It would require another customer canceling or voluntarily rescheduling their install date I pleaded to the installer supervisor and explained the situation the customer has already been through with his family and movers He said he would see what he could do Three days until the movers arrive Im already talking with management on offering compensation even though he hasnt asked for any I get a call from the installers he had called up a few customers who he had felt were flexible with the install date and actually asked if they would be willing to reschedule to accommodate my customer The stars were aligning His carpet was scheduled to arrive to the installers that day the newly opened slot could get him installed the next day and his movers would arrive on the third After all that happened he praised me and my team for being diligent on his order He never felt abandoned by the store We ended up discounting his order the fees he paid the movers for postponing in addition to several hundred dollars off of his carpet for the delays And the install went smoothly his family only had to endure a  days of sleeping on air mattresses I felt pretty accomplished ,If it could go wrong it went wrong An angry customer I actually enjoyed helping,456

Chordata,163,104,1ajmbn,373,I used to work at a clothing store that had a large Latin American clientele Occasionally someone would come to the register and know little to no English I would try to keep my language as simple as possible and say only the key things Other times they would have a child with them who would translate and speak for the parent and appeared used to this they were always darling sweet children Rarely people would get upset with me because I didnt know Spanish One day a lady came up and started speaking in Spanish sounding very annoyed I stopped her said I dont speak Spanish Im sorry Instead of letting me try and help her she stormed off A minute later her husband appeared He proceeded to yell at me about not knowing Spanish and how I had no right to be working there unless I did In his words This is a Mexican store not a white girl store I didnt realize stores had races but I guess he wants to go back to the time of segregation My manager at this point decided to care and ask what was up The man then told her about how I was a horrible employee because I didnt speak Spanish never mind the fact his wife didnt speak English and yet were in America so if there is one person you are going to get on about not speaking a language perhaps it should be your wife    My manager finishes up whatever the issue was I dont remember what it was but it was something small When she finishes the people leave and the first thing she does is turn around and tell me I really should learn Spanish to work at the store I was shocked At no point has this company ever considered itself bilingual There was no recommendation to know Spanish at the time of hiring I told her I was not going to learn Spanish She told me if I want a future at the store I really needed to This was a part time high school minimum wage job This women really expected me to think a minimum wage job in HS was peaking my ambition and I needed to learn another language for it I was so happy when I quit that place not because of the customers but because of the crazy manager I have a lot of stories about her I will add one later EDIT I never learned Spanish because I took French for some reason I should know Spanish because its very useful If a job required it now as an adult for my career I would learn it,I am not learning Spanish for minimum wage ,477

Osiris,131,78,1boqxq,373,You may remember this talehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbagdyellingatthewrongguyorhowabitchylady that I told a few days ago from my days working at a busy gas station  Here is another one thankfully shorterTwas a nice summer day one of those rare days in Oregon when the temperature is just right the humidity is just right and the breeze is just right so that everyone is wearing tshirts shorts and a big smile  I was having a good day at work that day as I had been told to be outside pumping gas in the sun and the warm  Customers were being polite and friendly  The manager was in a good mood  Everything was going smoothly  I should have knownIn pulls a large van and trailer with Ohio plates  Were busy but not hyperbusy at this point but I was always on the lookout for outofstate plates  For those of you who dont know Oregon along with New Jersey does not allow selfservice gas  Been that way since the s  But many many people dont know this  So I finished up the customer I was with and jogged over just in time to see the Ohio driver get out of his car and approach the pump to pump his ownI approached him a sheepish smile on my face my hands spread in a sign of apology and politely informed him that as an out of state resident he might be unfamiliar with Oregon laws regarding self service  Im also wearing a bright bluewhite uniform combo with the company logo and my name in bright red  Its pretty obvious that Im a gas attendant employed there and Im not about to be an ass to him  However his reaction was nearly instant and extremely out of proportion to what I had just said  He got a nearlyExorcistlevel snarl of rage on his faceAnd then punched me  In the noseNow Im not sure if he was just a weak individual or if he had held himself back but the punch wasnt THAT hard  Enough to make me take a couple steps back and say Owwwww but not enough to drop me or make it hard to see  I touched my nose  Blood  Wow  I hadnt been punched in the face since I was in junior high  And this individual definitely not a man had just suckered me for being polite and friendlyNow if you remember for my last story I was in college majoring in criminal justice while I was working at that station  Majoring in criminal justice isnt just sitting in classes learning about laws and investigative techniques  Some of the morevisceralaspects of law enforcement are taught  Like unarmed self defense  And when the guy wound up for a second punch I reacted with the training Id been taught  Left foot forward right hand grabbing their right wrist left hand placed below their elbow pivot clockwise on left foot while lowering right hand and raising left place assailants right hand in crook of left arm grab assailants right upper arm arm with left hand lift up left arm  Boom standard law enforcement hammer lockBut now what  I look over at the nearest employee who just happens to catch my eye and see the blood coming down my face and a guy who looked like a short bespectacled version of Ned BeattyhttpwwwtopquarkiacomDocsNotebookNedBeattycapjpg wrapped up like a Taco del Mar Supreme Burrito in front of me  I didnt even have to say anything he whipped out his cell phone and called Two units arrive rather quickly and take custody of the guy who really isnt talking just snarling at me  I make a statement to the officers and they go inside to review the security camera footage  Local paramedics were called since I was bleeding pretty good  I refused to be taken to the hospital though since I didnt have insurance and an ambulance ride  ER visit    I went to the doctor the next day who xrayed my head and said I had several broken nasal bones  This info was copied and given to the DASo Ohio guy got arrested and charged with Assault II a class B felony  My manager was nice enough to send me home with pay since I looked like well like someone had punched me in the face and that wouldnt be good for business  Ohio guy WAS from Ohio apparently doing a massive road trip across the US and due to lack of sleep or some other lame excuse came unglued at me  He plead out to Assault IV class A misdemeanor and spent a week in jail  I got three days of medical leaveTLDR  THATS why the bridge of my nose looks funny,Why am I bleeding Or how simple statements can lead to assault charges,451

Beake,80,80,1kqlew,369,Long rant incomingSo a few years ago I worked in a retail setting as a salesperson In my business we got a smattering of the demographic some very poor some very affluent There were bad eggs on both sides of course but the types I could not tolerate were not the demanding or angry or difficult ones the worst were the disrespectful ones The ones that when they come into the store one wonders whether they just parade through their whole lives thinking that they are better than everyone else And not on a case by case basis like Im smarter than you or Im very successful but that think that you as a person and retail worker are indubitably beneath them almost a different caste They dont even outright say disrespectful things they just treat you like a nonhuman servantWell my city had a few places of business that spawned a lot of these types You know the type The type who drives his BMW up to the first closest spot of the store and leaves it running the entire  minutes hes there Congratulations youre so important that the  seconds it takes to start your car cannot be wasted doing soAnyway I digress It is  and a gaggle of these types walk in One man whom I will call Pompous Shithead PS his wife and another couple I greet them as they walk in with a genuinesounding hello How are you all doing No response Theyve heard me the place is dead quiet and one of the wives made eye contact with me They walk a few steps away and start looking at a product I reluctantly follow them and ask them whether I can help them with anything or whether they have any questions PS looks at me square in the eyesI mean really looks me up and downfor literally  seconds and then says Yes tell me about x I explain all that I know about them and say how excited I am for the product to be coming in this year He cuts me off and starts asking a followup question Again he looks me square in the eye as he talks over me At this point Im becoming irritated to say the least I answer his question and as Im answering he turns away and says something to his wife Then he asks the same question indignantly because clearly he didnt hear me because he was fucking not paying attention to me When he repeats the question he takes a really condescending tone like hes annoyed at how ineffectual I am at communicating The other couple he came in with sigh at meI give a very concise truncated response He turns around and looks at the product without saying much and I stick around People at this store sometimes expect me or others to be their personal shopper and silently stand by them in the chance they need something carried or questions answered I understand being polite as a salesperson and being available but I cannot stand how some will without a word walk away from you or ignore you for several minutes and still expect you to follow them aroundHe asks about a model that is a step below the one on display This is a model Ive never heard of but sometimes especially when we change model years there are things I dont knowWhat do you have cheaper that has these features PS asksI hesitate somewhat unsure Im not sure that there exists one with those features He looks at me displeased and silent Then I say but Ill go double check the manufacturers website And as I walk away he says thats betterAt this point Im fuming but Im torn on how to behave I decide at this point Im going to be straightfoward with him to combat his rudeness and not kowtow to him It was the only thing I could do short of telling him to fuck off and I couldnt help him Well I look it up and Im  right They do not make that modelSir it looks like I was right they do not make that modelPS snaps at me They do make it Do I have to do your job for you How can you know so little He looks at his friends and shrugs at my incompetenceThey list every product they make on their website and I am unfortunately not able to order that item as they do not make itShow it to me I know for a fact that its on their website and you obviously dont know what youre doingI go to the computer and PS follows on my heels I pull up the website and show that it is not made There youre wrong idiot I thinkNo no I saw it on the internet just today Where are you He looks at the website thinking Im tricking him At this point I know hes wrong dead wrong Im also very pissed at his treatment of me I could have let it go The others in the group were across the store and standing so before I say a word to him I in faked consideration offer them the seats that are nearby the computer That way this idiot can be lambasted in front of his friendsPS was still mad and thinking of reasons why I was wrong so I offered to let him navigate the website so that he can make a fool of himself Now his friends are all watching too Hes getting very mad and clicking around on the website He cannot find it and does a Google search of it Still nothing All the while hes making excuses and blaming me wildly His friends who probably thought this would be a good game of humiliate the salesperson are now beginning to quietHe sees were on Firefox Well wait what the fuck is this This is all wrong Were obviously on the wrong internet What kind of set up do you haveThat is the browser sir Is there a browser youre more comfortable with He says the blue one at me like Im using some sort of technology designed to trick customers I click on Chrome even though I know he means IE and he flips At this point hes obviously embarrassing himself in front of his group and theyve ceased to make sighs and expressions at my stupidityI dont know what internet youre on but this isnt right Its on the internet I saw it Your computer is messed up The loudness in his voice lowers as he realizes hes run out of ammo to blame me with Then trying to maintain some semblance of dignity he says on his way out that hell find it at home and I better fucking learn my products better Yeah man you really showed me,Well This Is Obviously the Wrong Internet,449

tellsbadstories,64,54,x7lhx,374,This is a story from a few years back when I worked at a liquorconvenience storeIt was about  at night closing time an eternal half hour away and just me on cash register while my manager is cleaning the floors Two teenagers probably  or  years old come in and start walking around As they head towards the liquors section the manager starts to follow them He stops one of them and asks if he can be of any help obviously trying to scare them off The kid says no and starts to walk away He leaves empty handedMeanwhile the other kid has grabbed a handle L of rum and is heading towards my register As he turns the corner he breaks into a dead sprint throws something at me bursts out the door and jumps into an idling car that quickly pulls away As I begin to comprehend what has happened I look at my counter and see that his projectile was actually  cash covering the rum he took and leaving me a nice little tip Since the boys didnt actually steal anything we decided not to call the cops or tell the owners what had happened and finished off the night as uneventfully as ever ,The Honest Con,428
fuckyouasiandaughter,63,60,1gsz15,366,This happened a few months ago but I just discovered this subreddit so I felt like I should share the storyI used to work at an electronics store and this Asian family was buying a laptop for their daughter she just got into a prestigious high school I could tell the family wasnt well off financially and gave everything they could to the daughter My coworker was handling the sale but because the parents couldnt speak English I was there to translate From the conversation I could tell buying her this laptop is big purchase for them we compared prices and I tried to ensure the family got the best laptop for their budget Then comes the mandatory sales pitch from my coworker about setting up the computer and purchasing Microsoft Office Now this is the biggest ripoff and how we earn money at the store the setup fee which is just filling in your name etc when you get a new laptop is  the customer has to pay  for MS Office plus a  installation fee because we do it for you Its no surprise the parents was shocked at the price but they thought it was necessary because they dont know much about computers The daughter insisted on how much she needed it In Mandarin I kindly warned them against the purchase and explained why trying to save them some money since you can easily do the setup and pirate MS Office or even buy it for cheaper online The parents were really grateful for the information but the daughter starts CRYING like bawling her eyes out Needless to say my white coworker was confused as to why she is crying She starts wailing about how I told her parents not to buy this for her the computer wont run without the setup its not the Microsoft wont be the same unless she buys it etc Her parents are obviously telling her to stop but she already caused the scene My manager comes out sorts the situation out The parents thanked and apologized to me as they left but the daughter ratted me out to my manager since she can speak English So the not so secret ending is My manager was pissed that I lost income for the store the sales guy was pissed I lost him additional commission I was fired They were right to fire me but fuck that girl ,Im sorry I saved your parents  got fired,426

DrunkenBlackBelt,140,103,18ila0,369,So as Ive stated before I used to work for Dudercrombie amp Bitch  In previous stories Ive explained why I cant stand the company due to their hiring practices Towards the end of my time there I was looking for a new job already over the company  This set of events however was the last strawSo most companies dont allow their employees to purchase or use gift cards  It helps cut down on fraud and helps the LP keep track of the employee purchases  Well not DB  This was the only company Ive heard of let alone worked for where not only could employees purchase gift cards but could purchase them using their employee discount  So a  gift card will cost the average associate   Could be wrong but if I recall the employee discount was around Anyways ever since I had started my manager would tell me this girl who was an employee at a store about  minutes away would come in frequently and purchase  of gift cards from each of the  stores using her discount  However no one seemed to ever recall her name or when she was in  So I never pursued it much  However one day I get a call from my Kids store manager She informs me that the girl has been in and has her name employee number etc  So when I get some free time I jump on one of the store computers and do a little digging into the girls purchase historyIn a  month period this girl had purchased well over  worth of gift cards using her discount  No that not a typo  This part time employee making not much more than  a year has spent the same amount in gift cards as a Senator spends on a high class hooker  Now I consider myself an intelligent person  But even if I was an idiot I think Id have noticed something about this just maybe didnt add up  So naturally I call my boss and tell him of my findings  Now at this point me and my boss didnt get along  He was a nice enough guy but he was Alpha Male as fuck to the point it just went from annoying confidence to full out douchebaggery   Do you even lift bro will more than likely be engraved on this mans tombstone  Most of our issues stemmed from paperwork For some reason DampB still used fax machines Fax machines  But it would send the fax to the emails of the regional managers  So why we couldnt have just scanned it and emailed it is beyond me  But once or twice a week Id send a fax over to my boss and weeks later hed inform me he never received it  Despite the fact that I always got a confirmation it must be my fault Whoa unto he who would dare suggest my that he was wrong about anythingSo I send off all the evidence cocksure that all of my hard work would be rewarded  After all this was a big case  A little leg work and any proof that she was actively defrauding the company for personal gain and Id have a nice big case on my record  Right Well obviously not otherwise I wouldnt be telling you all this IdiotSo several weeks go by  and sure enough she comes in again another  worth of gift cards and off she goes tra la la la laDafuq  So I send my boss a text asking for an update on the case and if he wants me to send over the new purchases as well to add it it  My boss texts me back saying that he never received anything from me in the first place After several messages back and forth that basically consisted of Yes I did and No you didnt  I took  a screen shot of the email that HE HIMSELF forwarded to me  from his boss saying the case was passed on to Corporate LP  But nope I must send it all again correctly this time so he can get it going  So at this point Im angrier than Paula Deen when she doesnt get her hourly stick of butter fed to her  But I send it again making sure to CC the Regional Manager  Who of course responds with We already have this thank you  DerpsAnyways about a week later my boss comes to give me a surprise visit  We visit the stores go over the numbers he quizzes some of the employees on LP knowledge The usual stuff  Then when we go to the food court to have a on  During the course of the talk he brings up the gift card purchases  Here is to the best of my ability an accurate account of that conversationBromanBossman hereafter referred to as BB  So we got word back from Corporate on this girl and the gift cardsMe Oh yeaBB Yea they said just to let her goMe Oookay Were they just not able to prove that she was reselling them  BB The company just says to let it goMe Ok but I want to just be aware if it was a problem on my end If I screwed up Id rather know about itBB No the company is getting money so they dont see an issueMe  Dont see an issue  This girl has purchased over  times her salary in gift cards  Shes obviously selling them And who knows what else Shes probably stealing from the stores too in order to get more money  Is her store at least aware they should be watching herBB  Im not sure But as far as the company is concerned its a lot of money coming its way and they arent really losing anything since it still gets spent in their stores So they want us to just let it goMe Thats insane  BB Its what the company wantsWell fuck that  I naturally called up her home store first chance I got  I was informed that they knew about the girl and were told to just keep an eye on her as the company didnt see the point in investigating her when they were getting money  Such absolute bullshit  I went on vacation a few weeks after that and put in my  weeks while away  Im sorry if this isnt like my normal tales of idiocy racism and general retail shittyness but its something that needed to be toldTLDR I aint saying shes a gold digger But Im not gonna finish that line because Im white and enjoy that songEdit  Forgot to mention the girl only had purchased one pair of clothes using her employee numbers The rest were all gift cardsDouble Edit  Have been informed that I am wrong Gift cards can be sold  It isnt fraud per se what she was doing and any criminal case would be hard to prosecute unless the acquired funds were being used in an illegal manner  Otherwise it would just be a civil case  Sorry folks ,Tales from a Former LP  Someone is stealing from the company  Well long as we are getting our money,472
Shawntae,49,80,1noh33,365,Having worked in retail for many years Im glad I have brothers and sisters in the good fight against rudeness stupidity and downright fucktards I have many stories but this will be my first contribution Not my juiciest but it always brings a smile to my face when I remember itBackground I worked at a popular fast food place in high school and for a few years after Some franchises not only sold burgers and related items but also had a Mexican food menu offered as well I worked in one such store Story On this particular day I was working drive thru the lunch rush hadnt started yet so I still had energy and a positive attitude Enter Dumb AssMe Welcome to Derps Jr may I take your orderDA Boring typical order followed by and I want a Carne Asada BurritoMe No problem can I get anything else for you todayDA Yea I want to know why EVERY time I order a Carne Asada Burrito you give me steak Why doesnt anyone ever offer me chickenSilence I was pretty sure I was getting trolled and I was waiting for the customer to burst into laughter NopeDA Hello Why dont I get offered chickenHoly shit This is a serious questionMe Doing my best to not sound condescending because I pride myself on good customer service Umthe burrito isnt offered in chicken because Carne Asada means steakDA Oh Fine then Pulls forwardMeanwhile the entire back line is laughing because there is a speaker for drivethru and they just heard this conversation A few customers heard the exchange and were giving each other that Please tell me you heard that look My Manager just shrugs her shoulders at me I had to answer the question Its not my fault she didnt know Maybe next time shell think twice before giving attitude while asking a question she should know the answer toTL DR Customer gets kicked out of the restaurant for sticking penis in the salsa bar ,Im sorry you were given what you ordered,445
toxlab,37,101,1n6z9k,363,I worked barista at a big bookstorecafe The dividing line between the restaurant and the books was an aisle that led to the bathroom This meant that everyone who wanted to make a tinkle had to walk right past meThere was a big problem with people taking books into the bathroom Every time we discovered a toilet book there were jokes about it being flagged like the Seinfeld episode Of course the reality was that the books just got reshelved Especially since the area right outside the cafe contained a big shelf of ludicrously spendy art books People would go to drop deuce and lug a ten pound gallery book in there with themOh and the pornography Surprisingly it wasnt the stroke mags that ended up in the Shame Stall It was muscle magazines These people were so confused about their sexuality that they couldnt buy their whacking fodder and go nuts at home No They would conceal a mag get in a public stall beat it throw their fantasy boyfriend with the toned glutes on the floor and dart out in a cloud of shameThis starts to become an epidemic I would go to the little boys room for an afternoon wee and there would be multiple books in there Swing back through a few hours later and another pile of books would be there getting scuffed and kicked along the floor People would piss on them as well Truly classySo now the stage is set Im at the counter and everyone I see taking reading material into the bathroom gets hollered at I dont chase them but if someone breezes past me and I see books then they return without them I go into full public shaming mode and very loudly call them out on their bullshitA part of my job has become being the Bathroom Gestapo I soon realize that the pigs doing this stuff do it again and again A few are so bad that even after yelling across the dining room that they must retrieve their spent ammunition they would still play coy and act like they had no idea what you were talking aboutOne such case was Mr Dingdong He was probably in his fifties always well dressed and had that kind of smug superior attitude that retail slaves enjoy so muchHe would buy books get coffee wander around for a while selecting magazines and then away to the bathroom where he would get in the disabled stall and spank that monkey Bicurious fantasy material would then be dumped on the floor and he would bolt He would do this more than once on the weekend I found a mag covered in baby gravy one time and went back to the front and screamed at the boss that it had to be that asshole and he should be banned from the store The boss was kind enough to understand my frustration but said that since we couldnt prove it was him nothing would be saidMyself and my shift leader wanted none of that We wanted vengeance We vowed to drop everything else to spend our time surveilling DingDong I didnt give a happy hamsters ass if you had to wait five minutes for your latte I was doing something important GoddamnitMy shift leader was an awesome dude named Clark He was remarkably tall and almost painfully slender He looked like a goth scarecrowHe had this amazing basso profundo voice that carried far and resonated wildly It was always fun when he would sing to himself Customers would ask him to say things and giggle when he drew himself up and announced stentorianly We have a special on cranberry scones It was like working with James Earl JonesClark goes to the bathroom and returns with a disgusted look on his face Someone has left a trail of poo in the bathroom Little nuggets litter the stall I think no big whoop and go to pick it up with some paper towels like you would for a dogs leavingsNo no no says the bossman Gotta cross the store get a biohazard kit Gotta sanitize the area after removal End up mopping the whole bathroom because whos only gonna mop halfWe have an uneasy truce with DingDong Either hes getting better at hiding his shameful urges or hes decided that waxing his pole in public isnt worth getting yelled at by someone who drinks a dozen shots of espresso a dayWe start getting more fecal displays in the loo Little clumps the size of a Hersheys Kiss that end up getting stepped on or kicked and then tracked all over the hallway and into the carpeting And this means more sanitizing sessions in the middle of the day when the joint is at its busiestClark posits that it is the work of one man based on the consistency of the droppings He makes guesses about the guys diet and toilet behavior It was kind of like that scene in Jurassic Park where Sam Neil gets up to his elbows in a steaming pile of triceratops dookieA few weeks of looking for our phantom pooper has our alarm bells cranked up to one hundred percent We start following likely suspects into the shitter waiting until they start crapping and then leisurely washing our hands until they leave the stall Im sure there were a few nervous poopers who were denied their joy when we showed up and hung aroundFinally we had our break Clark went to drain the lizard and actually heard the sound of wet shit hitting the ground In a rage he stood on tiptoes to look into the other stall and found Mr DingDong with his pants down ass facing the stall door dropping bricks onto the floor while holding his garments out of the line of fireI became aware of the situation when DingDong came hustling out of the bathroom with Clark right behind him I mentioned Clarks voice was piercing The thunder he pulled up for yelling at DingDong was astounding It was like the first performance of an opera with Tourettes syndromeWhen DingDong had vacated the premises Clark returned and told us the story The boss was concerned about fallout from Clark looking into the occupied stall It wasnt like he climbed over the divider or anything he was just super tall and happened to be able to see over if he flexed a little bitStill the boss went to his boss to hash it out and they decided an incident report needed to be written Clark didnt quite know what to say but Ive always had a knack for colorful verbiage so I interviewed him wrote a rough draft and then punched it up before writing on the form I went nuts That thing read like a Ludlum novel You would have thought Clark had discovered the guy brewing chemical weapons in a hollow volcano lair We also went to great lengths to remind our overlords that this dude was not only creating a health hazard he was destroying company property through vandalismAdd into the mess the cost of biohazard cleaning supplies and labor for cleaning the bathroom more frequently and we had a great case against The Dong Matlock couldnt have saved that motherfuckerCorporate issued an official ban for DingDong and there were machinations of preparing a case against him regarding his feces getting ground into the carpet I dont know what ever became of that but we had no more Mr DingDongWe still found books in the lavatory but knowing we were able to shut down a serial spunker and then got his dumb ass in trouble for being a sadistic passive aggressive fucker was a sweet sweet victory,Mister DingDong,464

mermaidhairnoocares,130,63,17ym4e,359,I think my all time most hated type of customer are the preteen girls You know the type middle school popular girls dressed in glitter and Limited Too or Justice or whatever and hideous overpriced ugg boots The worst part about these girls Its not that they come in packs of at least  its not even that they destroy the store thought that is a good reason to hate them No the worst thing about these bitches is the fact that they have absolutely no money and yet they come to the mall acting like they own the damn place In the back of my store we have a shelf that seats a hollow wooden box thing in which about  total nail polish containers sit on and inside of Next to this shelf hangs like  belts underneath the shelf sits like  pairs of shoes Above the belts is our jewelry One day while working a pack of wild preteen girls come in and head straight for the back and start looking at the jewelry And though we have about a zillion bracelets and they pretty much all look the same one of the girls decides that she wants to look at a bracelet on the very tippity top of the rows upon rows of bracelets  And of course it would be out of the question to ask me for help getting it down No no that would be ridiculous Obviously the most logical thing she could do was to CLIMB up onto the shelf with the nail polish to reach up to get the bracelet Now our shelves were not made by ancient Egyptians Our shelves are basically tin foil sheets zip tied to the wall Not too sturdy So when I turn around to see her knee up on the shelf and her friend hoisting her other leg up I politely say Miss Im sorry but could you please get down from there The shelves arent able to hold human weight May I help you get something down She declines my offer and steps down They start to look at the lower rack of bracelets which satisfies me so I turn around and greet customers All of a sudden I hear the sound of a thousand angels being brutally murdered behind me Or maybe it was the sound of  nail polish containers a shelf and a wooden block crashing to the ground This bitch as soon as I turned around started to climb up again RIGHT AFTER I ASK HER IF SHE NEEDS HELP  Her weight as I said was not supported and the shelf came crashing down causing neon glittery PERMANENT nail polish to splatter everyfuckingwhere It created a tie dye of colors across the floor splashing onto the belts the shoes everything And you know what these girls do They laugh They hysterically laugh Its just too funny so funny HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH Im fuming But oh it gets worse They proceed to tip toe through the nail polish and leave a track of ugg boot nail polish tracks across the floor that was previously not effected by the fall And they are still laughing Payless shoes is next to my store and at this point my manager had had enough He goes up to them breaks up their giggle fest and says You better take those shoes off and haul your asses to payless before I call security on you They think this is even funnier and they strut out of the storeWe ended up having to damage out about  dollars worth of merchandise Not only that but my manager had to drive to the nearest beauty supply store on the other side of town and buy a gallon of nail polish remover which we had to dump on the floor and scrub for  hours So heres a shootout to my homie preteen girls you bitches really kill me ,The worst customers in the world Preteen Girls ,422
StevieDedalus,57,97,164j62,360,Years ago I worked for an electronics chain called Sadio Rack or something like that  I was something of a nerd and thought I would try my hand at some retail  I was assigned to a store not in the best part of town where the manager had been shot and killed in a robbery the year before  The new manager had dreams of being in the police force himself Sadly he was something like  pounds Kg and was unable to pass the physical requirements  He seemed like a nononsense kind of guy though and would drive me  his only employee  to reach for perfection  Dollar counts at the end of the day had to be perfect closing procedures had to be followed to the T  Any mistake was met with stern shouts and warnings  At his suggestion I spent many an hour working off the clock in order to make my hourly quota  My numbers looked OK at this infrequently visited store but only artificially soHis deep and abiding affection for the police led him to do things like give away a free  antenna with each policebought CB radio  This was a managerfromhells special In other words he simply carried the givenaway antennas on inventory I wonder if he ever thought about what would happen when the house of cards would fallThis was not all unfortunately  No the cards were piled much much higher  One day our dollar count was off by almost exactly  dollars  Strange why  dollarsI thought I had done well keeping track After a while the manager explained that he was a bit short and lent himself   So I was to simply add that  then  then  to the end of each day until payday we carried a certain amount in the till and deposited the restthe till amount kept shrinking except on paper  You might think this is quite enough  unfortunately you would be wrong  The cards were piled higher still If he had an interest in a certain item a new kind of walkietalkie or computer game or video camera he would cut open the shrink wrap pull out the item and use it at home for a couple of weeks  When he lost interest he would bring the item back and carefully tape the shrink wrap if any back in to place  It didnt take long for me to become really uncomfortable with these activities  It was simply the wrongness of the entire situation that got to me  When I would talk to him about it he would say Cmon Stevie  who are they gonna believeMe the guy with friends in the police a guy who has worked for the company for several years or you  I started looking for another job and became somewhat depressedHis UndoingIt is strange how I felt guilty in the end being the unwitting instrument of his destruction  Each store could look into the inventory of other stores  In this way if one store were out of an wanted item they could see if a nearby store had one  Sometimes the salesperson would jump in their car and drive over to pick things up while the customer waited  in order to not lose a sale and that sweet commission  In the end a salesperson from the closest store called asking for a pair of walkietalkies  I looked in our inventory to confirm and said yes we have them and we hung up Then I looked on the shelf  oops the boxes were empty  I called the other store  Sorry managerfromhell still has those at home I blurted out not considering the consequences  The next day the district manager called to talk to me Does managerfromhell still have that stuff at home  Yes I said knowing the game was up  Within an hour the DM and a loss prevention specialist I had never seen before were in the store  They went back to the office while I watched the store  Finally managerfromhell emerged  Choking back tears he said justdont dowhatI have done  And the house of cards finally collapsed  They said they wouldnt press charges if he would bring back everything he took home and repay any money he had out  but he was obviously fired  The DM told me later if he had known the extent of it he wouldnt have offered the dealI didnt last long after that  I got a job as a computer guy in a data center and have never gone back to retail  My sympathies though if you get a boss like I did,The Manager from Hell,457

woofle,59,82,18xxq0,355,I apologize in advance for this storys extraordinary length but I honestly believe that it is worth the read This happened over the summer as I was working my part time job at a movie theater I was sitting behind the guest service desk near the front doors just shooting the shit with my manager when this old man came storming out into the lobby from the hallway screaming WHERE IS THE MANAGER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT My manager a very tiny woman named Mary spoke up asking whats the problem sirEntirely ignoring her question the man continued screaming I WANT THAT MAN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH ASSAULT THIS IS AN OUTRAGE Mary persisted asking again whats wrong sirHE REPEATEDLY KICKED THE BACK OF MY SEAT EXTREMELY HARD AND WHEN I TOLD HIM TO STOP HE GAVE ME THE FINGER AND CONTINUED KICKING I WANT THE POLICE CALLED NOWOkay was this a kidNO IT WAS A FULL GROWN MAN TWICE MY SIZE IF IT WAS A KID I WOULD HAVE KICKED HIS ASSMarys eyes widened in shock at this statement and I broke in to the conversation Okay sir Im going to go talk to this guy I said grabbing a flashlight and a walkietalkie The entire time we were walking to the auditorium Uncle Scrooge continued on and on about how angry he was and how young people these days had no respect for their elders He entered the dark theater ahead of me and took a seat right next to his wife on the very end of the row There was no one behind himSir where is this guyRight over there he snarled pointing at a group of three guys one row back and about  seats overAs I approached the men I noticed that they were regulars who I saw around three or four times a month One of the guys immediately spoke up Is this about the old guyYeah he says you were kicking his seat and then flipped him off when he told you to stopWith all due respect regular guy replied thats bullshit It was dark when we were walking in and I stumbled walking up the stairs I fell onto the back of his chair and before I could even apologize he started screaming and stormed offThat doesnt really surprise me You guys have never caused any trouble while you were here and frankly this guy just seems like an angry old prick Just do me this favor if you need to get up for anything during the movie use those stairs over there and not the ones by his seat They agreed and I turned to head back out of the theaterWell apparently me exiting without these dudes in handcuffs didnt jive well with Father Time so he grabbed his wife by the wrist and stormed out of the theater againSir are you not going to stay for your moviethe following were this mans exact words I am exaggerating absolutely nothing he said NO I AM NOT SITTING IN THE SAME AUDITORIUM AS THOSE BARBARIANS I AM A  YEAR OLD MAN AND I DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PROTECT MY RIGHTS AS A SENIOR CITIZEN THEN I WILL NOT BE SPENDING MY MONEY HERE FURTHERMORE I WILL SEE TO IT THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE A JOB HERE ANYMOREI actually had to turn away from him so I didnt laugh in his fucking faceUpon hearing her employee being ruthlessly screamed at Mary stepped in again trying to defuse the situation Sir would you like me to refund your ticketsNOT UNLESS YOU CAN REFUND MY TICKETS FROM THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE AS WELL AS THE  LEFT ON MY GIFT CARDSir I cant do that I can only refund your ticket purchase from today Mary was cut off as the angry customer threw his ticket stubs at her faceFINE I DONT NEED YOUR MONEY ILL JUST TAKE PRIDE IN KNOWING THAT I WILL DO ALL IN MY POWER TO SHUT THIS HORRIBLE ESTABLISHMENT DOWN I honestly wish I was making this shit upHer mouth was actually hanging open in disbelief at this guy I wish I had gotten a picture because it was the most hilarious thing Id ever seen And kinda cute too if were being entirely honest hereHe stomped out the door and Mary and I both burst out laughing It was the most absurd situation wed ever witnessed That is until I noticed he wasnt gone yet Oh

hatetank,62,110,14gvoi,353,Long time reader First time posterI sell cell phones and cell phone accessories If you are signing a  year contract you have  days to return the phone before the contract officially starts If you want to return the phone you need to have the box everything that came with the phone and most importantly the phone must be in new and re sellable condition Easy enough right Well not for one guyThis guy comes in with a Galaxy S  that he purchased in a town hours away from my store Which is kind of weird Why not return it in the town where you probably actually live He wanted to return it because he wanted to wait for the new one Uh ok He hands me the receipt and its torn in half so that the bottom of it is missing There are also holes in it Like he put it in a hamster cage or something So I look up the original receipt in the computer He bought it  days ago Keep that in mind  Days Ago I go to the back room to grab the receipt off the printer and tell the story to my boss My boss gets a confused look on his faceBoss Did he ask for meMe No Was he supposed toBoss Yeah He tried to return the phone at another store The phone had been beat to hell The District Manager even said not to take it backMe Fuck This is gonna be funI head back out and inspect the phone Sure enough beat to hell Scratches all over the battery cover and chunks were taken out of the metal lining that curves around the front It honestly looked like he threw it down a flight of stairs My phone is over a year old and is in better condition than the GS There were no scratches on the screen though I took a deep breath and dove in head firstMe Unfortunately Im not going to be able to return this for youCustomer blank stare Why notMe Because of the condition Its got scratches all over the back and there are chunks taken out of the metal part I then point at the damaged areasHe then snatches the phone out of my hand like a child whos about to cry Im taking MY football and going homeCustomer Naaaawww theyre not so badMe Yeah theyre pretty bad The phone has to be in new and re sellable condition for returnsCustomer Why Its before  daysMe It is before  days but it looks like youve had this thing for monthsCustomer Phones get dropped I work in the redacted Service Center I know that things dropMe Why didnt you get a case That would have prevented the damageCustomer They didnt have the one I wanted It needed to have a kick stand on it I had the screen protector on it Theres no scratches on the screen so its ok Its not all messed upMe Regardless of that the phone is not in mint condition to put it in comic book terms He doesnt get what Im saying so I try to dumb it downHe then picks up the tattered remnants of his receipt looks at is through the hamster  gnaw marks for about  seconds and exclaims smugly It doesnt say that on here Ok smartass Time for some schoolin and baby I aint foolin I take the receipt from him turn it over and read aloud the line about new and re sellable condtionHe scoffs Scoffs like a rich white lady when told that she cant park her BMW in a fire laneMe If the phone came from the warehouse looking like this I would not sell it to a customer I wouldnt even want this phone That pissed him off He started looking at me as if I just said You know  Hitler had some good ideas but just went a little too farCustomer Thats a shitty way of weaseling out of a return He actually said weaseling Thats the first time in my life that I had ever heard anyone seriously use that term I was expecting him to call me a jive turkey nextMe Its actually not You hold responsibility for keeping the phone in good shape RightCustomer Whatever Let me talk to your managerMe The one you were supposed to ask for Sure Hang on His expression turned from anger to slight shockI grab the phone and go to the back office I hand the phone to my boss He inspects it and gives me a WTF lookMe I knowThe boss calls the DM and tells him the scoop He hangs up and sighsBoss Go ahead and do the returnMe WHATBoss Hahahhaha Just kidding Dont do it If he wants to escalade yes he actually said escalade As in the car it then he can call the DM Another store manager already looked at the phone and said it was in horrible shape so we aint taking it eitherMe That works for meI head back out to floor and tell the customer what the DM said Have you ever seen any Hulk Hogan wrestling match You know when Hulk starts getting beat down and the crowd is cheering for him With every blow Hulk regains more and more strength until finally he Parkinsons out the pain locks eyes with his opponent and Hulkamania runs wild You know about that right Well thats what I thought the customer was going to do to me I was about to get the big boot to the chest and then have a leg dropped across my neck But instead of that I got a bunch of mumbled cursesMe You can call our DM if you want He was the one that ultimately made the call on this after the other store denied your returnCustomer Can you call him Me We  just did I told you what he saidCustomer Gimme his number How about pleaseI wrote down the DMs number as the customer packed his hamster trodden receipt and stair case ruined phone away I hand him the card with the number on it and he of course snatched it out of my handWe have these huge windows in the front of the store where we can see the parking lot After the customer left he sat in his van for about  minutes Not doing anything Just sitting there A thousand yard staring into the store I could see him He could see me He finally started up his van He put it in gear and laid on the gas The van smashed through the front of the store sending  shrapnel of glass and wood into innocent shoppers I leapt though the air and grabbed a small child mere moments before a giant shard of glass decapitated him I landed and handed the child back to his grateful mother She started to tearfully thank me but I hand no time for gratitude I had a job to do I spun around and pulled my twin s from their holsters and rained lead death into the cab of the now bloody van  His body exploded in blood and carnage as the van finally came to a stop near the blank media section of the store I cautiously walked over the broken bodies of people who just wanted to look around I approached the driver side door and found that the assailant was still alive Barely but still alive He tried saying something but choked on his blood He spit it out and hoarsely whispered Do my return I turned to the camera took the cigar out of my mouth and said All sales finalIt was either that or he just drove away without incidenttldr  Put a case on your cell phone Watch more action movies,The Returninator,463

snobbery comeuppance of a horrible customer antics of a mentally deficient coworker exploitation by a horrid boss ridiculous store policies or any of the other usual fair of my or the rest of TFRs stories  It contains a single earthshattering KaboomLike many other gas stations ours included a propane refilling station  Ours was located off to the side of the parking lot kind of in between the pumps and the car wash  We were all trained on how to use it not terribly hard but something that needs to be done correctly to keep from getting sprayed with liquid propane  It was also one of the very few ways we could get commission  per tank filled  Doesnt sound like much but during a nice weekend you could easily get  worthOn this particular day I was outside playing dispensary technician instead of inside being in charge  Meh sometimes that happens and it was nice to get outside and run around a bit  A lady pulls up next to the propane refill gets out her tank and looks at us expectantly  One of the other guys calls out to her that hed be with her in just a sec so I forget about it and continue with doing what Im supposed to be doing pouring dead dinosaurs into metal containers  So I dont see my guy run over and start the process  I can only assume he did things the way hes supposed to because what transpires wasnt his faultThe next thing I know Im hearing a horrifically loud KABLAM from the propane station  I jumped the guy in the car I was filling up jumped pretty sure everyone for a  mile radius jumped  The sound was like a bigbore rifle going off right next to you  I actually felt it in my stomach  I whipped around to see a rapidly dissipating white cloud and my coworker and the customer laying on the ground  Oh God  Oh God  Oh man Oh God  Oh man Oh GodhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvYKyBdPeKHgI rushed over fearing that I was about to see dead or dying people  Instead my coworker is trying to sit up with a trickle of blood coming out of his ear  I gently place my hand on his chest and tell him to lay back down dont move  He cant hear me but at least gets the idea and doesnt try to get back up  I check on the lady customer and shes in a similar state unable to hear but seemingly fine from what I can see  Regardless I pull out my phone and call   I told them we just had a propane tank rupture and there are two people with possible injuries  Given how many firetrucks arrived I probably should have told them it was a gallon tank not the gallon monsterAs it was FIRETRUCKS FIRETRUCKS EVERYWHERE  Several ambulances too  The station is closed down and the two who were next to the tank get the once over by medics  Actually they got a twice over but given what had just happened and the minor miracle that neither of them had been struck by anything other than the ground it made sense to check and recheck  During this time the general manager the assistant manager who lived near by and was off for the day and the owner had all been called and told to come down  We didnt know yet what had happened and wanted to make sure they were on scene in case legal stuff came upAfter the initial chaos died down to something more akin to Black Friday in the late evening the fire investigator showed us what happened  He picked up the end of the hose from the refill station and there still screwed onto the end was the valve from the gallon tank along with a chunk about the size of a coaster from the tank itself  Wow  The investigator said that apparently the weld had failed though how or why he couldnt say right thenHowever one question remained  Where was the tank  It had gone between vanished pulled a Jimmy Hoffa demonstrated its ninja capabilities been taken by the Lord in the propane tank rapture The Rupture  It couldnt be found anywhere near by  We were pretty certain that it hadnt disintegrated because we would have found shrapnel and such  It was justgone  WeirdBoth my coworker and the customer were taken to the hospital for evaluation and to get their eardrums fixed  A couple hours after all this nonsense occurred and we were back to seminormal albeit shaken up  Ive seen those little green backpacking propane tanks get ruptured by idiots with guns before but never experienced a big tank going off  Thats a new oneFast forward about a week  One of the other coworkers who was in attendance to this event lived near by and walked to work  He walked through the door with a look what I found expression on his face carrying a propane tank with a big hole in the top  Damn dude where did you find that  Apparently when the top blew off it had kicked the tank across our parking lot over a street through the parking lot of the McDonalds adjacent to us over a fence and into a drainage ditch about  yards away  Hed found it when he was walking to work dropped his phone into the ditch while trying to mess with music and had gone after itI wish Id had the wherewithal to take a picture of the hole because it was pretty impressive  The edges all bent outward and looked pretty ragged  While the tank looked pretty new there were several dents that I assumed were from the tank banging into things as it made its first and unsuccessful attempt at space travel  We gave the tank to the GM and I think she ended up taking it home as a souvenirTLDR  Hank Hill would be disappointed Ah tell you whut,A very scary accident or Marvin the Martian would be proud,416

diinomunster,90,134,1pb94v,356,So I work graveyard pa at a gas station This morning around  I had a guy in his early twenties come in Our site is really slow so theres no point in having more than just me on most of my business is people paying for their gas at the pump with their card I greet him when he comes in like I do everyone and he walks right over to my register I figure he was a bar fly looking for his smokes and ask how I can help him Bad Guy you can hand me all the money in your till and in your safe I just sort of sighed at him Me listen buddy Youre not only on multiple cameras I gesture to the big TV that shows all my camera views but theres also a cop that circles this area constantly I have about fifty bucks in this till and Im not a manager so I cant get in the safe not true I have to count it down every night but he didnt know that Im also going to warn you now that I have  years of martial arts experience with three different black belts and I will use force after which Ill push this panic button around my neck which will lock you in until the SWAT team arrives laughs at you for getting bested by a five foot two girl OR you could turn and walk out my door and not come back and I wont say a damn thing to anyone about this He didnt even take a second to think he turned on his heel and walked out I dont know why he wanted the money but Im glad he decided not to go through with it Im quite proud of myself for handling that so well I know were trained to just give them what they want and hit the panic button when they leave but I think if you calmly and rationally lay the facts out for people itll turn them off to the idea Anybody else have crazy robbery storiesAdded edit okay because Im tired of repeating this haha If the guy had been intimidating at all If I had felt any that at all I would have just given him the money But he was a scrawny mirror half drunk guy who Im pretty sure Ive seen around and who just wanted more money for the bar No big deal I just had to make him think about what he was doing We had a big seminar on talking down people in self defense situations after I got my black belt ,Almost got robbed today,490
sellyourdreams,154,112,1f9j17,351,Ive posted on here once before but after reading through a lot of these posts the past few days I was reminded of one of my worse times in retailLet me just preface this story by saying I am white and I am also a bit of a germaphobe  But who among us isnt All of us who had to work registers day in and day out know that there is no way to know where your customers hands have been and you are constantly touching their dirty sometimes sweaty money sometimes you touch their hands as well when handing it off  This story starts out as your basic day I am working at a different store in my district to help out when someone called in sick  And like any other day I am helping customers and working on one of the registers checking people out  My policy has always been that whenever people hand me cash to pay for things when i hand it back I try to drop the money in their hands from a short distance so I dont come in contact with them  It sounds terrible but like I said I dont like to touch ANYBODY I dont knowSo then comes in this guy an African American gentleman with his whole family they come up to pay and hand me their money and I hand them back their change in the same manner I always do by lightly dropping it in their hands as to avoid any sort of germ to germ transfer  Then this guys just looks at me grabs my arm and pulls me towards him over the counter and rubs his arm all over mine  All this while saying Its not gonna rub off honeyAll I could say is wow  I could not believe what had just happened  The man and his family left the store and I just turned to my coworker mouth wide open flabbergasted  For one I could not believe that someone would do that  And for two this man basically called me racist so racist that I would even refuse to touch someone with a different skin color than mine  I was hurt and I was confused  After that I tried not to work that store again just to try to avoid this man who had assumed I was this terrible hateful racistTLDR African American man grabs my arm to demonstrate his skin color wont rub off on me after I had him back his change in a way that avoided any germ riddled hands,Its not gonna rub off honey,463
legomaniac,11,58,1e3tz6,354,Hey TFR heres a quick one from today No tales from the pet store today this time I was on my lunch break at a burgerice cream place near the storeThere was one lady ahead of me in line She finished her order I placed my order and I moved away from the counter to wait for my food All she had ordered was a cheeseburger so her order was up pretty quickly She takes her food and goes to sit downfor all of  seconds She then comes stomping up to the counter and slams her burger down on the counter fuming and red in the face The exchange went like thisCrazy Lady I told you people no mustard on my cheeseburger Theres mustard on this cheeseburger I want my money backEmployee Im sorry I can make you a new burger if you wantCL NO Shes screaming at this point I want my money backShe then rips off the top bun of the burger and shoves a finger toward it to prove her pointCL See Mustard I said no mustardE Maam there is no mustard on that burgerCL Then whats that yellow stuff all over it thenE thats the cheese maamThe psycho lady suddenly went pale and stood there as the stark realization of her idiocy hit her over the head like a Mack truck hitting a squirrel at mph She stammered for a few seconds then grabbed her mustardfree burger and dipped out of the storeThe employees and I had quite the laugh at her expense,Whats that yellow stuff,412
justined,41,55,1b45bk,353,Some of you have seen my crazy customer stories before but this one I blocked out of my mind for years and it has recently resurfaced because of an incident that happened to me recentlyI worked for a bookstore for a few years as one of the managers and had come across my share of batshit insane customers but this one was just so crazy I had to laugh at her It was a nice sunny day when Im standing at the information desk organizing books to go back on the shelves when a lady stormed up to me and practically threw a piece of paper at me and just started yelling I want my money back you idiots Seeing that she was just going to be the most polite person Ive ever helped I asked her what was wrong in my nicest friendliest voice She picked up the paper that she had thrown at me that was laying on the counter and told me to read it I looked at it and it was a bank statement with things blacked out all over the place with one thing highlighted Now I want to mention that names of places were her card was used were blacked out with a marker but the amounts her full address and checking account number were not blacked out I looked at the highlighted line and the following conversation followedMe Yes mam it shows that you charged  here on August  or whatever date it was what seems to be the problemHer This was a fraudulent charge My son came in and used my card to charge that and I want my money backMe Okay so your son came in and purchased the items Does he still have themHer Yes of course he does I found them all in his roomMe Okay well just bring the items back and we can do a refundHer No they were purchased without my consent so he gets to keep them and I get my money backMe Uh wat No thats not how it works You can bring the items back and return them and get the money back or you can take it up with your credit card companyHer Good Thats what I was going to do in the first place but I thought I could come here and try and reason with you since your staff has always seemed intelligent I guess I was mistakenMe Okay well before you leave I just wanted to let you know that we have a camera there pointing above me at the pillar where you can clearly see a camera and if you do submit this to your credit card company as fraud we have you on camera admitting that your son bought them you have knowledge of that and you are refusing to return them The credit card company will most likely find your claim to be fraud and enforce severe penalties upon you She then turns her big ass around and scoffs as she storms out of the store She came in several times after that and wouldnt you know that we never got a letter from the credit card company saying that she was disputing the charge The best part is that our camera is one of those two second delay cameras without sound So you could see her talking to me but couldnt hear what she was saying and you only saw every other second And for the record I have no idea what her card company would have done if they found out she was committing fraud ,Silly lady thinks she can get away with fraud ,408
crazypancakes,72,82,1aiwun,351,I still cringe of this moment but maybe the healing process will begin after I share this tale I would like to point out that even though I would like to I dont blame the customer for my PTSD in hindsight it was totally my faultSo I work for an electronics company that also offers training on products that we sell you come in at a scheduled time sit down with a trainer and theyll either teach you something from a set curriculum or will show you specifically what you want to learnA few years ago we ran a promotion over Christmas to attempt to increase the number of people that took advantage of this training program In order to attempt to do this if you bought a particular product we would offer one free training session kind of like a taster The conditions were you would either need to sign up for it during the actual purchase or thirty days immediately after said purchaseThe stage is set Enter the playersMe Hi what can I do for you  Customer Hi I purchased a device last week for my daughter as a Christmas present and I just found out I can sign her up for a free training session on how to use it  M Absolutely Ill just need to take some information  I get the recipients name and other informationM Great The last thing I need is her email address so she can use it to set up her session  C recipientsomeemailcom  M All right shes good to go Shell receive an email in a few minutes explaining how to get started  C Wait What do you mean shell get an email  M Shell receive an email from us explaining how to set up the session  C NOOO This was a surprise Christmas present You have to stop the email from being sent  I know that it is impossible because after I submitted it it goes straight out but being fairly new I ran to the back and spoke to a Manager that confirmed it I went back out with the worst sinking stomach feeling Ive ever hadM I am so sorry but it has already been sent out  C I cant believe this YOU JUST RUINED CHRISTMAS  She turned around and left leaving a line of customers staring at me Over the next few days I kept replaying it over in my head convincing myself it was her own fault for not telling me it was a surprise Even though that is true I should have been smarter and assumed or at least asked Either way it was one of my worst moments,How I ruined Christmas,433
tavissd,50,73,17qhw9,346,I take tickets at an arena at my school and it was shocking  I go to a university in the northeastern US not in my home state but that is kind of useless information  So i was taking tickets last week when some big dude tries to stroll through the door  I ask for his ticket and he looks at me as though i asked to cut his arm off  He then continues to walk by meThis time i had to get in front of him and ask where his ticket was and that games are not free to attend  He stares at me and says Dont You Know Who I Am  I say that i do not and ask for his ticketHe pushes past me and i had to get a cop to tell him to buy a ticket or leave  I later found out that he is a small town high school football player that just won a game earlier that day  What arrogance from someone that barely did anything to be recognizeable  TLDR  Some no name thought he should get in everywhere because he did almost nothing ,Dont You Know Who I Am,419
Gratestprsnalive,65,65,10wz4u,350,Weve all had that one employee when working who just didnt quite fit The store I work in has a great atmosphere Awesome bosses great employees its not a bad gig for someone in college to work easy hours at a relaxed pace For the most part all employees are really laid back We work in an affluent area and are surrounded by other large chain stores Nearly everyone in the store kind of has the same personality and outlook it makes for great fun  nearly everyone except bobWhos bobThink the twentysomething suburban thug Hes never gotten out of the pocket of mommy and daddy but lives his life like a hardened criminal Hes never to anyone in the stores knowledge committed any serious crimes and the store doesnt hire felons So hes become something of a running joke for the store Bob is a little slow no matter where he works there will be complaints Generally hes just asked to do backup work This way he doesnt get in the way and he cant possibly mess anything up But despite being off put and weird Bob has never done anything majorly wrong until recentlyThere are three registers in the store There are of course no cameras in the entire establishment Maybe thats just the policy of corporate maybe its because theyre too lazy to update our already inferior equipment who knows Bob has just finished working one of the tills in the front and is told to take a lunch break Our lunch breaks are thirty minutes so it was a little strange when Bob came back almost  minutes after he left for lunch Maybe he just lost track of time Another two hours pass and the store closes Its this time that the manager notices a major discrepancy  Somehow the till in the back which receives the least amount of business is six thousand dollars short No one can explain why this is Of course we cant leave until the matter is sorted so corporate is called and the police as well Everyone who has worked this day has to remain in the buildingSome of us are beyond suspicion I generally work front register and have no access to the back register though even with that Im still asked the routine questions Eventually were asked to go home for the evening and the police and managers help sort out the problem Theres never any more than a few hundred dollars in any register so the store couldnt have been robbed When going through the logs of the registers it is possible to see who was signed on and what transactions they made The managers finally see Bobs name come up and he had rang out sixthousand dollars in gift cards Best buy walmart game stop anything you could think of with electronics He was of course arrested and while we might not have cameras the other stores were kind enough to lend the police their footage of Bob lumbering around the store He had spent all of the money in  minutes Im not even sure I could if I was told to Just another exciting day in retail,The sixthousand dollar lunch break,415

killerq,28,70,1imbk2,343,I have posted here before and had no complaints about my job even though it is not exactly retail I work at a horse racing track in the northwestUsually in doing normal vending or commissary tasks but this particular day I was helping people move their art to their cars from the art show Fine no big dealWhat did bother me was one particular customer who was an absolute bitch about how we helped her load her two  very heavy sculptures We got a call at  and grabbed our flatbeds and made our way up to the second floor and started looking for a lady standing next to a sculpture We find her easily as she was the only one in the exhibit and politely explained to her that were going to take the sculpture down the employee elevator off the loading ramp then walk it around to up front where shes parked She then tried to explain to us how it was our job to carry it across the busy second floor and carry it down the escalator across the pavilion and then put it in her car Now this is a sculpture thats two piece put together that I would estimate weighed about  pounds each That may have been doable if the entire second floor was empty but not with all the people I caught my friends eye and knew he had the exact same thought process as me We were absolutely not doing that especially not alone I then tried to explain to her that it simply would not be safe for the art us and the other customers to do it her way She got all huffypuffy with us at that point Why didnt they send  grown men to do this This line made me extremely extremely angry for some reason Nevertheless I kept my happy customer service voice on trying to explain how our way was much much easier and safer and that we would be more than capable of doing it in one trip our way She wouldnt have it She blew a gasket I STILL DONT GET WHY YOU TWO LITTLE BOYS WONT JUST DO IT MY WAY THE CUSTOMER SHOULD ALWAYS COME FIRST ESPECIALLY WHEN I SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER At this point I pulled out my radio walkietalkie whatever you wanna call it Well call my manager Danny for these purposes killerq to DannyThis is DannyYa this lady is screaming at us because we wont carry the two parts of the sculpture down the main stairs and the escalator Shes demanding you at the momentPut her onpause while I had her the radioWhat seems to be the problem maamHe then said exactly what I had said about the safety and she seemed to calm down and accept it wasnt our fault While she was talking to us again my manager came up and everything got sorted out We ended up going down the employee elevator down the loading ramp and around to the front with both pieces being taken at the same time Perfect Then we load the pieces into her SUV TO HER EXACT SPECIFICATIONS had her sign out the art and prayed she never came back We went back inside and clocked out talking about what a bitch she was We walk around the corner and what do we see The same lady screaming at the front desk people then turning to scream at us when she saw us Turned out the sculpture had broken when she went over our speed bump at  and she wanted us to refund her  for that sculpture Tough shit lady you signed it out were no longer responsible This felt so right after she made a huge fuss out of nothing but a reluctantness to follow her stupid ideaedit we visibly laughed at her which ticked her off even more then just walked by blowing her off knowing we were off the clock and she couldnt even report us,Why Why do it the risky and stupid way,413

Bravesfan,31,90,1midzg,344,Hello all As many of you know Ive posted many stories about my dealings with my old boss Mike the past few days and today I thought I would share the most hilarious situation that I walked in on after hearing a commotion in the produce aisle EnjoyIt was a Saturday like any other day except on this particular Saturday our produce manager was sick I was pulled off of stocking and was put in charge of running the produce department for the day For a little background I worked at a small store where Saturdays like most grocery stores were always our busiest days save for preholidays and one of the reasons that our Saturdays were so busy was because we had a massive amount of Amish come in on that dayAnyways Im in the back marking down some fruit and vegetables that were starting to look a little on the bad side Amish would buy them for their pigs and all of a sudden I have an amish man burst into the warehouse and over to the side where most of our produce pricing takes placeMe Err excuse me sir we dont typically allow people in the back is there anyway that I can help youAmish Dude AD Yeah I was wantin to buy some vegetables that I could feed to my pigs Yall normally have some on Saturday but theres none out there and Im in real bad need of someMe Im actually pricing some up now we would fill banana boxes with them and price them by the box if youll wait outside of the warehouse doors then I can bring them out when theyre doing being pricedAD Thank you very muchSo I keep pricing boxes of old fruit and vegetables all of a sudden I hear some yelling and screaming so I walk out to where I think Im hearing it from which is the produce aisle and Mike is there harassing the amish guy that I had just told I would bring some fruit out forAD This ad says that these apples are supposed to be on sale today only and I want it at this priceMike Well I dont have to sell it at that price and what are you gonna do Call corporate You cant even use a phone The amish in my area used the payphone outside of our store if they ever really needed oneAD This ad says that its this price and Im buying them for this price And Ill go outside and use the payphoneMike That payphone is our property and you cant use it if I say you cantMe Err Actually that payphone is on the other stores property right next to ours So technically we cant deny use of it to anybody seeing as its not on our propertyMike What are you doing out of the back Didnt I tell you to only do produce todayMe Looks like Im in the produce aisle Mike And that sale ad applies to all stores If we dont have an item that would be the only reason that we dont sell something at that price While I suppose that you could refuse to sell him those apples at that price today the next time I see him I would sell him the apples at that price without telling youMike And how do you propose to do that after I fire youAD Excuse me Sorry But I was wondering Takes apple out of bag if I could throw this apple at your headI dont know why but I just suddenly busted up laughing in the middle of the aisle Other customers who had come over due to the commotion just started busting up laughing Mikes face got about as red as the apple and told the man that he needed to leave the store He tells me to escort the amish guy out and while displeased about it I do itAD Hey my wife is in the buggy if we dont tell Mike then he wouldnt recognize my wife You wont tell him will youMe Nah but only on one conditionAD Sure What is itA little info here our amish barn where all the amish would park is off to the righthand side of the building when entering Mike would park his motorcycle in front of itMe You know the shovel in the amish barn Well could you scoop up some horse crap and deposit it in front on that motorcycle thereThis friendly amish guy starts laughing walks towards the amish barn grabs a shovel and just starts bringing out mounds of horse poop and depositing it all around Mikes bikeI walk in with his wife throw three bags of apples in her cart with a note we had limit  You had to have a managers note to buy more Not a manager but the cashiers all loved me I grab a box that I had previously marked down to  grab a sharpie mark it down to  with my initials on it And go about working on produce againMike leaves about  minutes later and comes storming back into the store and calls me over the intercom to come to the frontMike What did you doMe Errr Ive been working in produce all day Ive been working  hours without a break so Im going to go take one nowMike No youre not Youre going to go clean up the horse poop from around my motorcycleMe Actually no Im really not My lunch hour was more than an hour ago and I havent been able to take one since you believe everybody should work around your schedule So instead of a  I think Ill go on lunch good luck with the horse shitI go and clock out and walk out to my car to go home for lunch I look at Mikes motorcycle and I kid you not there is at least a five foot radius of horse crap all around his bike This amish guy must have been out there doing this the whole time that his wife was in the storeThat amish guy would come in to the store at least on a weekly basis and we would shoot the breeze so next time that he came back I asked him why he put so much horse poop around the bikeAD Well I started on it and then another amish guys name Completely forgot the name pulled up and asked what I was doing I told him he went back to the barn and pulled around that big trash can that yall have for the horse poop and grabbed a shovel from his buggy and we just started dumping it all around the bike He thought it was the funniest thing everIt was one of the best stories that Ive ever heard and that guy and I would talk every time that he would come in to the store He actually just had a baby roughly  months ago and I got to meet him when I went back home  weeks agoIve got a little bit more homework to finish up then off to more classes and to tutor some middle schoolers then I plan to post at least one more story tonight Most likely the story will be about my dealings with unruly

narelie,86,65,wrg75,346,Ok so bear with me I had to cut out some of the details to keep within limitSo our story begins years ago when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guys website  total to cover the design I made and the guy the client hired on to code Yes I was a moron about pricing back then The Client well call him TJ threw a fit about the price but eventually agreed to it The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish but ended up turning out really nice The sites monthly profit actually went up by  after the new design was launched No Im not kidding thats how much of an improvement I did TJ however throws a massive fit demanding extra free work done and that we WILL do it because hes paying us so much As Im in the middle of trying to calm him down and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project he suddenly does a  personality change Hes suddenly extremely polite and nice and says he completely understands Im a bit weirded out but didnt think much of it Well that evening the guy who I paid to code calls me up freaking out His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night Considering wed just gotten paid by TJ to our Paypal accountsthis was odd Both of us checked Paypal and found out TJ had reversed the payments Coder in a fit of rage promptly logs in to TJs website and strips down all the files and leaves up a note on the website of TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder and this is what he got Not a  classy move but within two minutes TJ was calling me up screaming with rage He made all sorts of insane rants that we overcharged him that we scammed him now we have to give him the entire design for free and that if we didnt wed suffer I explain politely that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversalnonpayment the files will be removed until receipt of the payment He rants a bit more about how this is illegal extortion but finally gives back the money Coder puts back the files problem solvedRight I guess coder felt like this wasnt good enough I had no idea but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coders buddies and Coder had enough of TJs shenanigans He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJs industry and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited word got out Fast I heard about the post within half an hour and by the time I went to go check TJ and coder were having it out on the forums screaming at each other I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJs lawyer later found out it was his friend telling me theyre going to be suing me for slander extortion etc I tell Coder to cut it out and I get the forum thread locked downTJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my wayhes gonna track me down and beat me up hes gonna cut me hell find my familyI end up blocking him because Im not gonna listen to that After blocking himradio silence I thought perhaps magically this would all blow over  A few weeks later I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account Hes apologizing and asks how Im doing I said fine and he asked if my kids were nearby as they typically are Hm weird but I said yeah of course ones even sitting in my lap TJ is all kids are wonderful like that So I need to know if youll make a design for my new site and gives me a link At this point my kid was squirming so I got up put her down so she could leave and went back to see what he was talking about I click on the link and immediately hardcore porn floods the screen Im horrified and look at TJs im where hes laughing and saying how he bets thats gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget Im furious and block him At this point I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problemsThis occurred a few more times over the next few months Id get messages from fake people wanting to know quotes asking me to look at their site and see what I can doand itd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on TJ went  and made a post about me with all sorts of insane claims Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry and that with every project I stole my clients bank account numbers SSNs and their CC numbers Id had it and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me I would contact the police I was done with it and Id drag him through courts if I had to TJ flipped out claimed this is all MY fault I cut him off say Im serious and Im done Im blocking TJ again and if I hear ONE WORD Im going to the policeThat was the last I heard of him for a while a year in fact I later ran into his expartner from the website we did for them He was furious asking if Id heard from TJ Turns out he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny He contacted the buyer and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed Hes siphoned off something like  of his partners money and kept it for himselfThat wasnt all though as he was discussing this with the buyer he noticed in the sites activity feed someone withdrawing small amounts this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well and the new owner was like yeah come to think of ittheyre been withdrawing every day New owner checks the account and HOLY MACKEREL they have a  pending balance Thats literally impossible to pull offespecially considering that the account was created the day before the site sold Upon further digging new owner discovers a few accounts all created the day before the sale with thousands in their balance And all with payment details that belong to TJYep hed made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer slowly over time He wouldve ended up making off with something like  if hed not been caught So yeah expartner and new owner were furious and trying to find TJ I just said Im sorry cant help you there and went back about my business Tthe next week I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages Upon checking every single one of them was from a clientfriend of mine in the industry ranting about the same thingTJHed had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for But hed closed everything down and told everyone  theyre not being paid This is something now to the tune of k Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers and were in the process of setting up lawsuitsAnother year passes and I meet a new client and we end up becoming friends We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people weve dealt with and he suddenly blurts Well nothing tops this one guy TJTJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick One of which was my new client Neither would have any of it got their money back and told him to scram  So TJ tracked down their addresses and called the police in BOTH towns at about  am He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun and holding their family hostage threatening to shoot them if they movedYou can imagine the response that happened to thatFirst guy was woken up at  am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement He was surrounded by about five cars all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on himSecond guy wasnt actually home he was on a trip but his family WAS so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them outEverything got straightened out of course and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had doneThe icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lessonbut that the only one who couldnt have that done to her was that amp narelie Because Id been smart and it was difficult to track down my addressNew client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest recordIn the year since I last told TJ that if he didnt cut it out Id call the police on him his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming hed been robbed of his TV and Xboxonly to have been found out that he was lying he traded them for drugs Afterwards he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs assault and then domestic violence His businesses all folded and with the lawsuits looming he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed Didnt work from what I hear they still managed to track him downHowever he isnt done yet Hes shown back up recently attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startupsaying hes changedProbably gonna be really difficult for him to do that considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month Child Abduction Kids safe as far as I can gatherAnd it somehow may or may not have gotten out as a nice email with a list of all the arrests and his mugshots To all of the major industry players Maybe,The Tale of the Craziest Client,411

theycallmejeremy,42,51,1gzp7q,351,I worked a lot of retail before the awesome job Im in now and reading a lot of these posts took me back to the dark time in my life  I worked for the biggest newused specialty video game retailer in the country that should be enough info for context  Video game sales are unique people dont need video games like they need clothing food and so on but often they seem like not getting the new Madden or Call of Duty is the end of the world  Here are some of the most memorable experiences I hadPanic DadI was working during Christmas season at the busiest store in the district and one of the top  volume stores in the country  Needless to say it was busy as hell the entire time  I normally answered the phone since I could run a register and work the phone better than the other employees in the store  On December  a parent called and I could hear the panic in his voice  He obviously had a list that he had neglected and he was going to be in trouble if he couldnt find everything  He listed off about twelve different items and we had  of them and the one we were missing was across the street  I told him that if he gave us two hours I could go get the item from the other store and wed have it ready for him  This was going to be a  sale so I was willing to do a little extra  I went to the other store got the item rang everything up and suspended the transaction for later to save time  A couple hours later a man walked in and I could tell by the look in his face that it was Panic Dad  I called him over to my register exchanged pleasantries and had his total ready before he knew it  He had tears in his eyes apparently I had saved Christmas  His total was about  after tax  He handed me   dollar bills and told me to keep the change and asked for our customer service and district managers numbers so he could tell them how thankful he wasTheres a car on top of yoursSame store a couple of months later  Im the third keyholder assistant to assistant manager basically and Im working with the assistant store manager  Were decently busy but it started raining so we were slowing down  All of a sudden we heard multiple loud crashes outside  A few customers ran to the door to see what happened a car had sped through the wet parking lot hit a median and flipped onto two other cars  I could see that one was a VW Beetle and I knew the person who drove it they worked next door  I was thankful that it wasnt my car until one of our regular customers said Hey theycallmejeremy you drive a white Malibu right yep my car was under theirs  I went outside and helped the teenagers who were in the car on top of mine get out and get safely down  After the police came and got everyones info I went inside to call a tow truck to get my car and the kid who was driving actually asked me if we had any Call of Duty  in stockOK those were memorable but not really the horror stories that you may be looking for  Here we goHell yes Ill pay moreAt this store we had to try and sell a discount card for used merchandise  It was  and got you  off used games for a year  It was a good deal especially when items for the XBox  and PS started at  used  A customer came in and bought a bunch of used games for his Playstation   This conversation took placeMe Your total is   Do you have one of our discount cardsCustomer No thanksMe Itll actually be free today and itll knock more than  off your totalCustomer I said no thanksAs Im ringing him up another customer goes to our other register and hands someone his discount card and game and is told what his total before and after wasCustomer Why does he get his stuff on sale and not meMe He has our discount card sir  Its  and gives you  percCustomer I SAID I DONT WANT THE FUCKING CARD JUST GIVE ME THE DISCOUNTI ended up just adding a card to his purchase saving him   He leaves in a huffMY DADS A COPWe sold both new and used games and we were pretty good at checking the condition of items coming in  Return policy was actually pretty good if you bought a used item  New items could only be refunded if they were sealed  Used items could be refunded for whatever reason within  days  That gave customers a chance to test a game to make sure they liked it and was often the best selling point for used itemsAnyways a teenaged kid came in with the game Two Worlds the day after it came out and wanted a refund  I saw it was opened and explained our return policy  He wasnt happy and complained about how bad the game was  I told him what the trade in value was and said that was the best we could do  He starts screaming You stole my money  Refund this now My dads a cop  I started laughing  After knocking down some of our displays he left the store  Two hours later he comes back with his dad who is indeed a city police officer in uniform  His dad walks up to me and asks Cop Did you steal sixty dollars from my kidMe No sir I think hes upset because of the game he purchasedCop He told me he came in and tried trading in a game we bought for him Wednesday and he left the game and his money on the counter and you took it and kicked him outAt this point I laughed I couldnt believe he was serious  The cop wasnt laughing though so I realized the kid just told a lie to his dad  I showed the police officer the CCTV footage from earlier in the day and when he saw his son knocking over displays and walking out of the store with the game in his hand his dad just hung his head and sighed  Nothing like video proof that your kid is a worldclass brat huhSlap heard across the worldThe last story Ill go with today is the one I tell people the mostI was behind the counter after the XBox  came out and we were sold out like everyone else  We had presold our allotment and although we had some systems in the back they were already paid for and just awaiting pickup  I had just rung up a customer that prepaid and brought his out from the back  A guy that was about  and  lbs Im  and  lbs walked up to me after I gave the first customer his system and started going offCrazyI called yesterday and yall said you was sold out of sMeWe are sold out we just have those that were preordered  We should have more by the end of JanuaryCrazy Oh hell no  If you have it you have to sell it to me  You cant be discriminatingNote that both me and the customer were white and other than being a little short and skinny there was nothing to discriminateMeSir we can only give the systems to people who paid for them alreadyCrazyNaw son now that aint gonna work for meHe starts walking towards the back like hes going to barge into our storeroom and grab one  My employee at the end of the cash wrap starts to put her hands up and the guy shoves her into a Playstation  clearance rack  Another customer gets between them and tries to help her up and the crazy guy pushes him away  At this point I start walking over and put my hand on his shoulder and ask him to leave  He wheels around and gives me a fullon slap in the face  I look at our store manager whose chin just hit the floor and toss my store keys to him I was pretty sure I was about to get fired  I told him to call the police and I grab the guy in a headlock and take him down to the ground until the cops get there  A few minutes later his wife and teenaged son come in from their shopping somewhere else and see me holding him down  The wife starts screaming and clawing at me and the son jumps on my back like I said Im a big guy so I wasnt fazed  The cops came and all three of them got to spend some quality family time in jail,Stories from Video Game Hell,402

flowerpoints,51,66,1dxg9u,349,Had a funny experience working tonight A guy comes up to my register with a  desk fan Before I can scan it he says Wait I just want to borrow itI am for obvious reasons taken aback by this statement I ask him what he means and he says Im going away in  days so I just want to take it for a couple of days and bring it back before I leave Thats cool rightI explain to him that he can buy the fan but he can only return it if its unopened I leave out the detail that he can get a refund if its broken because far too many times I tell people that and a few days later have to give refunds on items that were obviously broken intentionally He then looks at me perplexed and tries to calmly explain to me that most grocery stores just let you borrow stuff Trying my best not to laugh I just explain to him that our store policy states that you have to purchase items to walk out with themTo his credit he wasnt rude or anything just a new flavor of stupid Does anybody know where this guys logic is coming from I dont know of anything besides libraries that just lets you borrow stuff,Apparently this is a library now,415

FranzJosephWannabe,26,69,1huznz,341,So I thought Id share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago Be forewarned this is a serious wall of text comingAs anyone who has worked in retail knows you will always have at least a few quirky regulars who come in to your store Sometimes its a good kind of quirky like She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in Sometimes however its a bad kind of quirky This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirkyThis customer not his real name but well call him Mr Rogers because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr Rogers evil twin brother had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about  min before we close This would happen every time he came Now when doing a water test back then it would take a couple of minutes we didnt have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals We were doing oldfashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything Normally it didnt take too long but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night Not to mention it can be a messy process meaning wed have to clean everything again before we close upHe would come in get his water tested ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions Mr Rogers Does the Turboshock come in a  lb bucket Me No sorry it just comes in  lb Mr Rogers Why Me  and tap impatiently waiting for everything making me feel like I was defusing a bomb Most of the time we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after but seeing his car pull up at  was enough to turn an ok day into a fullon panic attackSo one day I was at a highschool soccer game when who do I happen to see but Mr Rogers He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didnt notice that I was there His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr High team and he was there to see her I debated whether or not to say anything to him but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was And then completely by accident I overheard him talking to one of his friendsMr Rogers told his friend what he thought was the secret to getting good service at any place He claimed that by coming in at the last minute right before they closed he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs Mr Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail After all he said why should they get rewarded if I dont get the best possible service He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows for a fact that this technique worksI thought about confronting him right then and there but I managed to restrain myself By the time the  minutes were up in the match I had already formulated the basis of a planThe next day I went to my manager the sweet older lady from my last post and told her about what I had overheard She was furious She wanted to refuse him service shred his file and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit and she agreedThe next time Mr Rogers came into the store of course at  til closing we made sure to treat him like a king We gave his water sample every test under the sun Ph Alkalinity Calcium Free Chlorine Total Chlorine Copper Iron Phosphates Total Dissolved Solids and many many more No test was too obscure for Mr Rogers When he asked why we were doing so many tests we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect We wanted no stone left unturned But my water is clear protested Mr Rogers No no we just want it to stay that way After all we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight So we continued to do tests all the while his foot was tapping tapping tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine But Im not It looks great We took him on a minitour of some of our newer stock explaining in excruciating detail how it all works Finally when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use he made it very clear that he had had enough By now it was well past closing time We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago He was trapped and he knew it He looked at me and my manager and asked why are you doing this Why are you taking so long And why are you talking to me about things I dont care about My manager looked him in the eye and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice she said We just want to give you the best possible serviceIt took a second but then he got it Someone had let his secret slip His foot stopped tapping and the only thing that he could say was Oh So we decided the torture was over We let him go after that And while he did continue to come to our store and get excellent service I might add he no longer came  minutes to closingIt was one of the only times Ive ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career I will always treasure that momentTLDR Guy comes in  minutes before closing to get better service So we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture,We just want to give you the best possible service Sweet sweet justice,410

Akasha,45,94,1jevlf,344,Hi TFR I work in a fast food restaurant with a drive thru and encountered this gem the other dayA woman came through with her man beside her and their baby in the back They were parked as we had to change the smoothie syrup and cook  of their burgers After  minutes they came back through the drive thru asking where their food wasTheir reasoning for this is that their baby way getting too hot in the car the car they were still in It was a very sunny day and the drive thru had no more shade than the car park so nothing was solvedThe worst part is that their food was being sent out at that very same moment so as the employee with their food was in the large car park looking for their car we had to make their entire order up for them again holding up the entire drive thru lane for a further few minutes because of course they refused to park up,I came back through the drive thru because my baby was getting hot in the car,438

regalfurpig,109,83,1ny2dl,337,I have had several serving jobs over the years and for some reason they have all been at different sushi restaurants As with most servers out there I have seen some weird customers some rude ass customers and some delightful ones But the face of the average restaurant customer can often be well ugly and ungrateful Now anyone who has worked in a Sushi restaurant for any decent amount of time will tell you that there a lot of requests for substitutionschanges to even the most standard sushi roll These can run the gamut from the simplest no cucumber please to the ridiculous I want this roll but can you take out all of the ingredients and replace them with this Oh and can you make it without rice Thanks We try to accommodate these special requests despite it often pissing off the chefs and taking a stupid amount of time to enter into the POS Its always the best when you get ridiculous requests like this during a dinner rush One such busy Saturday night I was sat with a group of  people who I would soon be able to tell were not accustomed to Asian food in any way whatsoever This particular restaurant was SushiChinese but also served other Asian fare such as Thai and Korean dishes due to the owners mixed Asian ethnicity Well I get the group set up with drinks and when I come back to take their order I do my best to answer all of their questions about the food and what would suit their tastes best Most of them order pretty tame Chinese food dishes like orange chicken etc but this one woman decides she wants to be adventurous but you know on her terms She decides she wants to order a Philadelphia roll salmon cucumber and cream cheese roll but instead of salmon she wants to know if she can sub it for chicken quote because salmon smells super fishy Really though Chicken I can understand if you dont like fish but hey dont order sushi then We have lots of other stuff I try not to look completely weirded out as this is definitely a first and I tell her Ill have to check with the chefs who inform me that it sounds utterly disgusting but they can get some cooked chicken from the main kitchen and will give it a shot OK so weirdo request  is check and out of the way I inform her that the chefs will be able to accommodate and she seems pleased Next she says she wants to try Pad Thai which is a pretty standard Thai dish with noodles bean sprouts some meat or tofu and a peanut saucecrushed peanuts She says it sounds good but she wants them to add hot sauce to make it spicy Now Pad Thai is naturally a little sweet which I mention to her so Im skeptical how that is going to work out flavor wise but she insists so I let her know it wont be a problem and she orders it with Tofu weird since I thought shed want chicken lol Special request  done and done All of the food they ordered comes out without issue despite how busy we are kitchen can crank it out and her gross chicken sushi arrives She motions for me to come over and lets me know that the roll is not up to snuff and the cream cheese is all runny I let her know that Im sorry she is unhappy with the roll but the chefs did what they could to accommodate her unusual request and the cream cheese is most likely runny because they had to put cooked chicken with it Shes not happy with this answer and tells me she doesnt want the roll at all OK great Next her spicy Pad Thai arrives and she eats half of it before she calls me over to tell me how her wise ordering tactics have failed again She complains that the flavor is awful OK glad you managed to power through half of it despite that and she would like something else I confirm with my manager first that he will void out her first dish and replace it with something else She orders something tame this time and with no substitutions thank god And the rest of the meal goes without incident or so I thought Their bill came out to about  all together and this is after I have struck the gross sushi and Pad Thai off of her bill As Im taking the remaining dishes off of the table she makes some comment about how they shouldnt have to pay so much for such sub par food I put on my best fake smile and said that I was sorry if they were unsatisfied with their meal and Id be happy to get the manager to come over and speak with them She just huffed at me and rolled her eyes She ended up paying their bill and left ZERO tip After a double shift and a stupid busy dinner service taking care of all of her dumb requests I felt like I could cry looking at that stupid slash through the tip line on her credit card receipt TLDR I bent over backwards to cater to stupid requests from a woman with no sense of taste and she rewards me by leaving a fat fucking zero for a tip on a  bill ,You gave me exactly what I asked for even though it was disgusting Well no tip for you,420
