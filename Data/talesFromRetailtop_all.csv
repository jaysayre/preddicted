Osiris32,405,,2386,1d8v0y,,4710,"Some of you may recognize this story, since I posted it before elsewhere, but again this is the perfect sub for it.  And it's a happy story.  We all like happy stories.

This story starts long ago in the dim ages, when bear and bison swarmed the forest and the prairie.  Or about 2004, which ever you prefer.  I was working at a sporting goods/automotive store at the time, at the customer service counter.  A father and his son, who appeared to be about 11, came in and asked where the camping equipment was.  I pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch, and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up, ""I'm going on my first Boy Scout campout!""

Now, if you've read my other stories, you'll know that I'm an Eagle Scout.  I take this position very seriously, and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young scouts on their trail to Eagle.  So I looked over at my boss, a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting, and asked if I could go help these people personally.  She smiled and said yes.

The father was COMPLETELY out of his element with camping gear.  By his attitude and behavior I would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life.  Everything in the aisle perplexed him, but thankfully his son's troop had given them a list of what equipment they'd need.  So for about 20 minutes or so I went through the list with them, point by point, explaining what each thing was, what it did, what version to use, and how Kybo Tape is the scout term for toilet paper.  That got quite a bit of laughter.

During this time I also talked with the kid.  He was very new to scouting, only having joined a couple months prior.  He was enthusiastic about getting to go out into the wilderness and camp and make campfires and fish and all the other activities he'd heard about.  I talked about my experiences in scouting, which was all of what he was talking about and so much more.  Climbing Mt Hood, going to National Jamboree, touring military bases, rafting down the Deschutes, the kid was very impressed.  I kept telling him, ""this is only the start, you have no idea how awesome it can get.""

So we finally have a cart filled with a small tent, sleeping bag, cooking equipment, small first aid kit, beginner backpack, rope (you and yer fuckin' rope), shovel, water bottle, etc etc etc.  Quite a haul, but I'd done my best to get everything that the kid would need while still keeping things cheap.  Well, cheap-ish.

The total was something like a bit over $200.  Now, they say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but if I could have taken a picture of the dad's face when the total came up, it would be worth a MUCH longer essay.  It was a shock/fear/resignation combination that said, ""damn, I didn't expect it to be this much.  But he's so excited, I can't tell him no, it would break his heart.  Maybe if I just eat ramen for the next couple weeks, I can afford this.""  As dad reached  reluctantly for his wallet, I flashed him a smile, looked at my boss, and knocked 20% off the total.  ""A scout is helpful and kind,"" I quoted.  The father thanked me profusely, as did the son.  They left with a spring in their step and smiles on their faces.  My boss said, ""that was very nice, but don't ever do that again.""  I replied, ""but boss, you do realized that, from now on, they are going to be in here on a regular basis to buy camping equipment, right?  I know that kid's look, he's just like me at that age, and he's going to be spending a LOT of dad's money here.""  She laughed, agreed, and the deed was put out of my mind as other customers approached.

But the story isn't done yet, dear reader!  For about a week later, look who comes running through the door, but our little first-time camper, with dad trailing along.  This kid very specifically wanted to see ME, because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me.  Awwww, sweet!  Sure, let's take a look...hey, I know this camp!  I know exactly where you were!  So we talked about being at that camp, and taking the hike down the hill to the old camp location, and how the fishing in the lake is, and the deer that just don't care that you are around, and how the chow hall seems to be made mostly of sieves given how drafty it is.  We had a brag board up for the hunters who had trophy hunts, so I pinned a couple of the better pictures to the board.  This kid beamed with pride, then ran off to use the bathroom.

This is when dad chimed in, and thanked me for a much more personal reason.  He and the kid's mom had gone through a fairly nasty divorce, and she had majority custody.  Scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son, and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them.  He got a little choked up about it, as did I.  I simply told him, ""this is what scouting is all about.  'Help other people at all times.'  This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Over the next year+, they became regulars of the store.  I knew which troop they were with, a large and active one, so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies.  More pictures got posted to the brag board.  His first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the Mile Swim badge.  I started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor, and had a great time.

However, real life gets in the way.  School, and a couple of new jobs meant I couldn't devote the time I needed to to help his troop out.  We basically drifted apart, and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad.

Until late in 2010.  I get a phone call out of the blue.  The voice on the other end is deeper, self confident.  ""Is Osiris32 there?""  ""Yeah, that's me, who is this?""  It's that young scout from the store, calling me up to invite me to his Eagle Court of Honor.  I stood there in my kitchen in mute shock.  All those memories of helping him out came flooding back.  ""You better believe I'll be there.  I'll even try to fit into my old uniform.""

And so I did.  Though I eschewed the shorts and went for pants.  This young boy, now turned into a young man, stood tall and proud as they pinned the Eagle Medal to his shirt, recited the Eagle Charge, and gave a short speech thanking people who'd made a difference in his life.  He looked right at me as he gave the speech, pointed me out, and said, ""this guy right here, he was the first adult to encourage me.  His example as an Eagle was what I followed.  I cannot thank him enough.""  Tears flowed.

Following the ceremony, I found his dad.  Scouting had made both of them better people.  He'd decided that being bitter towards his kid's mom wasn't what a scout leader (oh yeah, he was now an assistant scoutmaster, the bug bites very hard) should be doing.  This had allowed their divorce to become more amicable, and they had successfully renegotiated custody some time earlier.  He was a happier man, and was so proud of his son I was pretty sure his chest was going to burst.  His son, now tall, strong, confident, and an obvious leader, was destined to go places.  He would be graduating high school the next spring, and was looking at getting into college for a degree in psychology with a minor in criminal justice.  He wanted to live his Oath and Law by being a police officer.  My own chest felt like it was going to burst at this point.

I still keep in touch with him.  He's now coming up on his 21st birthday, and is readying applications for various police departments around town.  I've already told him that I'd gladly be his reference, because he's one of the guys we all want to become a cop, someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty, honor, integrity, generosity, and kindness of spirit.  He'll make a damn fine officer, and I can say that a little part of that, just a little part, is because of my willingness to help him choose tents one day several years ago.

I've been staring at the white walls of the video game store for about 2 hours since lunch. It was a very slow day, I glanced at the tables in front of the store,and my heart ache. It was the donation table for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda that wretched my country and even though I have donated what I can, I still feel sad whenever I saw the people on the TV suffering. 

I was broken out of my thoughts when the doors jingled open . Customers, finally!

She was a small girl, about 10 or 11 and a pink Hello Kitty backpack was at her small back. Her mother was accompanying her, a few plastic bags in tow. I recognized her mom. When I was selling cigarettes on the street, I see her peddling clothes she made herself on her stall at the market. She now has her own online shop and making a name for herself. 

The daughter just had a birthday and her mom finally has enough money to buy a PS3 and some games. 

The girl half-jogged, half-skipped to my counter. She opened her backpack and pulled out a console. Her mom handed me the bag full of games.

""Can I return this?""

""Sure sweetie, no problem.""

I inspected at the console and the games, and nothing was opened. Per policy, I returned the money to the mom. She handed the money to the girl, and she ran off as fast as her little feet can take her. I was about to ask when the mom, seeing my expression, explained.

""She wants to sell her birthday gift, so she can donate to the victims.""

I honestly teared a bit there. She was willing to give up what was supposed to be hers and gave to those in need. That's real generosity out there.

While I was watching her talking to the girl at the donations table, I was reminded that even though there are a lot of selfish assholes in the world, there's a person just like that little girl and I was happy.

Edit: Yolanda and Hayain are the same typhoon.

UPDATE: I was texted by my co-worker today and somebody is claiming that they are the mother of this story and now reaping in the rewards for their ""good deed"".

SonaOrAFK,158,,442,18e1ew,,2598,"Back in my old video game job, where we were Crazy about Games, we used to have a policy that customers could try out any game in the store. It really helped cut down on returns. This meant, however, that we would get a few customers who would abuse this policy. Enter Draconian. 

I don't know his real name, I just know that every character he made on any game, and the Xbox profile he set up on our demo unit was named Draconian. He was a late teens/early 20s man child. About 6'5"" and overweight. He would come in almost daily and spend hours playing games, rarely purchasing anything.

When this happened, The Elder Scrolls:Oblivion had come out. Draconian was coming in daily and spent literally hours standing in one spot and playing the game. I would inform him every half hour or so that he needed to take a break and could just play games all day. He would save, walk away for a minute and jump right back to it when I started working on something else. 

After a few days of this, I was tired of him. 

The next time he came in, he played Oblivion for a solid 5 hours. I didn't bother him once. When he finally took his leave of the game, and I was sure he was gone, I loaded up his game and dumped almost a week's worth of progress in one part of the map. Warped him across the map to the woods, and left his character naked and alone. Deleted every save file except this one, and shut the game off.

The next time Draconian came in, he asked to play Oblivion. I gladly obliged, put the game in and walked away. I can still remember him sputtering and frantically trying to search for a way to get his progress back. He was nearly in tears as he left minutes after.

brooksyx,284,,945,1hfejp,,2486,"One summer when I was home from college I worked at a small pizza franchise location that sold whole pizzas or pizza by the slice. After we closed we had a policy where we would continue to sell pizza that was in the window while we cleaned, we just wouldn't make any new pizza. Normally this was fine, mostly we would get people from the other businesses in the strip mall wanting a late night snack. 

Anyways, one night this lady and here two daughters come in like half an hour after we closed. I was already stacking chairs at this point which is one of the last things we do.
I say hello as she walks in and say we are closed but would gladly sell her some of the slices we have left. She just ignored me. Here is how the rest of our encounter went.

-Lady (standing at the register): ""Are you going to help me or not"".

-Me: ""All we have left is pepperoni, how many slices would you like""

-Lady: ""Slices? I don't wan't that! I want a (some kind) Pizza and we are in a hurry so make it quick""

-Me: ""Sorry mam but we closed over 45 mins ago, the ovens are off. I would gladly sell you what we have left"".

-Lady: ""What? Your lights are still on which means you aren't closed, you should still be making pizzas. Whatever give me everything you have left.

-Me: (Box up pizza, charge her for a whole pizza even though its a slice short. saves her money) ""Ok mam here is your pizza, your total is $x.xx. I charged you for a whole pizza to save you money""

-Lady: ""What!!! That isn't a whole pizza, you can't charge me for that. It's missing a slice."" (One of her daughter's explains how I am saving her money)

-Me: ""Again, your total is $x.xx.""

-Lady: ""Ok that's fine. It's half price right?""

-Me: ""Why is it half price?""

-Lady: ""Because you are closing""
(We go back and fourth a for a bit, she asks for the manager. I go get the owner who was cleaning in the back)

-Lady: ""Your employee was being very rude and was trying to charge me full price when it should be half""

-Owner: ""Lady, we are CLOSED, no half price pizza. Infact no pizza at all"" (Grabs pizza box and throws it in the trash) ""Please leave"".

fhqwhgads41185,372,,1100,1mhutw,,2447,"My story requires a little bit of a prelude to know how things work in the restaurant I work at.

I work at a Mongolian Grill all you can eat buffet. There is a huge buffet of raw vegetables, means, and sauces. You throw what you want in a bowl and bring it up to the grill. We fit about 14 meals on the grill at a time, and everyone stands in line waiting for their meal to be cooked. When it is almost done we go to the first meal on the grill and offer teriyaki to the first person in line, and then the second, and so on. 

Fairly regularly people decide not to stand in line, and then fail to correct us if we are pointing at a meal that doesn't belong to them and ask if they want teriyaki on said meal. So, mistakes happen. Enter Mega-Bitch.

MB is here with her family. All their meals are on the grill, but she does not stay in order, but switches with her son. Her son wants teriyaki, she does not. But, being switched, she gets it. She points out the mistake and the cook (fortunately I was not cooking at this time, while normally I would be) apologizes profusely and offers her another bowl. She refuses the bowl and proceeds to curse about what a fucking moron he is, doing so loudly so the whole restaurant can hear. She refuses to eat, although her family sits down to eat. She complains loudly the entire meal. When they go to pay she complains to the hostess, and she offered to comp their drinks. The woman demanded that their food be free because of the terrible service they received. The hostess tells her ""The cook offered you another bowl, they tried to fix the problem, no one treated you horribly."" The woman retorts something like ""I'm going to get online and write a terrible review of this place!"" The hostess smiles at her and says ""Good. You do that"" probably holding back laughter at the woman by this point. And then, out of nowhere, and right over her son, she punched the hostess square in the face.

Then her and her family left. One of the waitresses ran outside and got the license plate number. Not only that, they paid with a Groupon! So it was easy to track her down. The police arrested her, and the hostess pressed charges.

What's really great is that a few months before that hostess had been in a car accident that fucked up her neck, and it wasn't healed yet. That punch, which normally one could take quite well, sent her physical therapy back to stage 1 which made it count as a new injury, which made that woman's punch assault. And, that punch being thrown over her child counted as child endangerment. The best part... She was a special needs teacher! And with a felony charge you can't work with kids, so as a result she also lost her job!

I'm shocked anyone could be that aggressive. More so that such a person worked with kids. But I am extremely happy her life is completely fucked up now!

I was home from break and working at a local sandwich/connivence store. After work one day I decided I needed some brushes, and A.C. Something was on the way. So I'm wearing my work uniform from my sandwich store(its just a polo shirt).  I'm also wearing a lanyard that is plastered with my school's name and attached are my keys and my student ID which is also plastered with my school's name. I'm in the painting section which is next to the fake flowers when an elderly lady doesn't just tap, but grabs my arm.

One day my boss asked if I would interview a 16 year old girl for a position we had. She said she would hire her if I think they would do well. I sit down to interview the goth. Imagine the girl with a dragon tattoo about 150lbs heavier, and more face rings. She was wearing a uniform for the fast-food joint down the road. The conversation goes something like this. 

""So i see your wearing a uniform. Are you still working for them?"" 

""No i just walked out because they were being dumb"" 

""Being dumb? What do you mean by that?"" 

""They were being dumb, because they were asking too many questions"" 

Awkward pause... 

""Well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions. So what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place?"" 

""Well I like pizza"" 

After the interview I decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day. My boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her. The next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad. The goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face. My boss told me to deal with it. So i go out and tell the goth she has to change. When asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away. The goth busted out laughing. She actually went home and changed. We put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth. A month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm (she always wore long sleeve shirts). I asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal. Come to find out she was having the typical ""no one understands me and my parents just don’t understand"" issues most kids have; she was just taking it to an extreme. I told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor. She actually did it. In a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about 6 months.

I just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend."" My heart about imploded on itself. I felt so guilty. Here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss. I hired her as a joke. I decided not to tell her. I figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares. Fast forward a few years later and I’m in my profession going out to lunch and i hear ""MR WEBUSMASTER MR WEBUSMASTER!"" It was her again. Her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black. She is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker. She said she wanted to help others who were in her situation. I almost cried.

Two years ago, a woman stopped in to get some stuff to give to her kids as Christmas presents. She had two boys (8 &amp; 15) and wanted me to help her pick out some stuff. I showed her some of the smaller things, but she actually ended up buying a big mortar kit for the kids, figuring that she could help them light them off and it would be more impressive. 

A few days after Christmas, she came back and told me this story.

It was just her and the kids, and they had had a great Christmas. She thought her younger son would be excited by the fireworks, so she’d let him open it, but after he had ripped off the wrapping paper and seen what it was, he didn’t really say anything about it. She was sitting across the room from him, and asked him what the present was that Santa had gotten him. He mumbled something and set the box aside. She was a little disappointed that he wasn’t more excited, but she didn’t say anything and they continued ripping open gifts.

Later that morning, after the gift hurricane had died down, she decided to ask him about the fireworks and went to grab the box. She couldn’t find it in the pile of presents and she didn’t see it in his room. It’s a good sized box, about 3 ft tall and 18 inches wide, so it shouldn’t have been hard to spot. She asks her son about the big box that Santa had gotten him and he just shrugged his shoulders.

It turns out; he had hidden the box under his bed. When he'd opened the present, he had quickly reasoned that if his mom found out that Santa had given him a big box of fireworks, she would take them away. He had played it cool and hidden the box when she wasn’t looking.

I was queuing in the ten items or less line in a well-known UK supermarket chain.

I heard her mumble to him ""Just grabbing lunch, I'm running late"", before chucking her meal deal, which consisted of a sandwich, a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps, onto the counter. I should clarify that I was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane; the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunches.

As the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card, the guy who was *supposed* to be next in line - without saying a *single word* to the queue-jumper - picked her bottle of juice off the counter, knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue! She turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue, too. Her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity. She couldn't legitimately complain, because she, along with everyone around her, was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do. Plus, there was a whole queue of hungry British people observing her now!

I have always lived in the city, but moved to a very small rural town last year.  Lots of farms, ranches, and woods.  I’m actually growing to love it.  Except for the community of rich, entitled people who come down on the weekends.  Thankfully I do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal.  I’ve had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store, both with the same amazing witness.

First one – I was shopping on a Friday afternoon a few months ago, stocking up regular stuff as well as a planned party for my SO’s coworkers so the total came to about $200.  I had been helping bag everything as it was being rung up.  The clerk finished, gave me the total, but before I could move, the woman in line behind me stomped forward, swiped her card, and punched in her PIN then went back to yacking on her phone.

I just stood there for a moment, looking at her.  I finally said, “Excuse me?”  She cut this glare at me and turned away.  So again, “Excuse me?”  And I get “I am on the phone, God some people are so rude!”

*You want rude, bitch?*  “I was just wondering why you paid for my groceries. Not that I don’t really appreciate it.”  Her “What?  I’m not paying for your shit!  How dare you!  What makes you think anyone would just pay for you?”  Me “Well you just did ma’am.  You swiped your card and paid for my groceries.”  Her “It doesn’t matter when I swipe the card during the transaction.”  Me “It does if she’s still ringing up my transaction!”

And now we’ve got a problem.  Transaction is complete and yes, she has paid for my $200 groceries.  She actually got off the phone at that point.  We get a manager over to try to figure out what to do.  They end up deciding for the manager to do a complete return of the groceries to her card and then ring them up again so I can pay.  And cue the bitching.  She’s in a hurry, her time is valuable, this is ridiculous.  So I toss in, “Lady at this point I could walk out the door.  My groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused!”  Now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers.  But there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman.  He’s a solid 6’6 or more, just a HUGE guy.  Obvious biker.  Black leather, t-shirt, chains, you name it.  When I said that, he cracked up laughing and said, “Wow, you’re a cute thing but you are a little badass aren’t you?”

The bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business.  *That’s it lady, poke the grizzly bear.  What could happen?*  And this guy’s face went from laughing to scary in a second flat.    He told her, “Lady you need to just stand there quietly while they clean up the mess you made.”  I don’t intimidate easily but even I was nervous.  But then he smiled and winked at me.  So the manager does the return and I chat with scary biker guy.  He told me that he keeps telling his little girl that “It’s important to be polite, but it’s also important to stand up for yourself.”  Every time the bitch woman made a noise, like huffed or explosive sigh, he made this little sound almost like a growl.  The clerk offered to check him out a few times, but he just stood there, arms crossed, a solid mountain of a man, talking to me.   Finally the return is done and the bitch has the nerve to ask, “So can I get checked out now?  You are going to let me go first right?”

I just said no and the manager started re-ringing my stuff.  Final dig – bitch started the *I am never shopping here again, do you know how much business you are going to lose?*  I glanced over her items and said, “What thirty – thirty five dollars?  Oh my God they will have to lay off half their staff.”  Biker guy called me “Little badass” again and went to the next lane to pay for his stuff.   

---------------------
I’ve run into this guy a few times.  Even met his wife and ‘little’ girl once (who’s not much younger than I am).  He calls me ‘little badass’ every time. 

--------------------------------
Then came today.  I just needed a few things so I run in on my way home.  I got to the store and there are signs everywhere.  And I mean everywhere.  Both doors, all across the front windows, posted on several aisles, and on every register – CASH ONLY – Computers not working, all purchases must be paid in cash.   I’m good so I grab what I need and get in line (there were only two open).  In front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff.   Everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook.  

Clerk - “Uh, ma’am, you’ll need to pay cash, our computers aren’t working.  There are signs.”

Woman – “I saw those signs, you can take a check, it’s the same thing.” And tried to hand the check to the clerk.

Clerk “Ma’am I can’t take that.  We can only take cash.”

Woman waved the check in the clerk’s face  “Just take it.  It’s the same as cash.”

And me “Ma’am the only thing that’s the same as cash is CASH.”

Woman “You stay out of this you filthy little bitch.”

Me “What the hell?”

And enter biker guy and wife – “Hey little badass I thought I heard your voice.  How are you?”  We chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerk’s face.

Me “Lady seriously, you need to pay with cash.  They cannot take a check.  A check is not the same as cash.”

Woman turned, “Look you…” caught sight of biker guy and slammed her mouth shut.  Glared for a second then says “So what would you suggest I do?”

Me “Well there is a bank across the street, another about a half mile that way, another about that far that way.  I would suggest you go get cash.”

She grumbled and slammed things around… then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit.  Gave me one more glare and stomped out.

Biker guy “Still the little badass I see.  Though I wish I’d called you little ass kicker.”

Biker’s wife “She won’t get that reference.”

Me “sure I do.  It’s what Daryl called the baby when she was born.”

Biker guy just roared and yanked open his jacket to show me his Walking Dead T shirt.  We ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last night’s episode and what we thought was coming next.

--------------------------------

I should mention, with the first incident, I did think after I left the store that I could have gone to the ATM and pulled the cash to pay the bitch.  But I’m actually glad I didn’t think of that so that I got to ‘waste all her valuable time’.  If you actually read all this, thanks, hope you got a laugh.  And hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dude.


TL;DR – Bikers are amazing, defenders of little badasses who stand up to bitchy customers.


Edit Fixed the typo, they bug me, thanks for catching it!

Edit2. Sorry for the Walking Dead spoiler, if anyone knows how to hide it please let me know.  I didn't realize there were places that were so far behind us.

And for those who went there,  I have a boyfriend that I moved to the middle of nowhere with.  And Big Ass Biker Guy has a daughter about my age, and a wife who is very nice, but is a Big Ass Biker Babe who could snap me in half.  He's a great guy that I run into everywhere (small town) but mostly see at this store.  THANKS! !

FredFltStn,134,,1106,1nfvgn,,2086,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

I've posted a few other stories [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/) if you're interested.

**STORY:**  A guy came in to pick up some fireworks. He was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends. I spent about 20 minutes walking him through the store, explaining the different items to him, and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted. He mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to &lt;other store&gt; and how their prices were cheaper. Each time, I’d apologized, but I let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs, and that I thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question.

The third time it happened, I walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from &lt;other store&gt;. I found the stuff he had mentioned, and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected (and that’s why I keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter). In fact, on a couple of items, we were about half of &lt;other store&gt; price. Amazingly, he didn’t seem happy about it, but he kept shopping.

By the time he was ready to check out, he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff. It was mostly large assortment packages, finale cakes, and big mortar kits, with a few smaller items here and there. To speed things up, and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter, I started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier (my dad). About halfway through, I got to one of the largest items, a massive mortar kit, and called out the price of $199.95. When my dad was ringing it in, the register display looked like it had screwed up, so I stopped him and went to check it out. Sure enough, the item had rung in at $19.95. 

While I’m talking to my dad about it, the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake. I show him that the last entry was for $19.95 instead of $199.95. He immediately tells me that I have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up. I showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it, and that the cashier had just miss-keyed it when he had rung it in. The guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that I have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that. I calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong, I would sell it to him at the incorrect price, but since it was just a miss-key, we would just void the last item rung in and do it again. Now armchair lawyer guy (ALG) starts yelling that he knows his rights and that I’m breaking the law if I have the cashier change the price and I don’t sell it to him at the wrong price.

Now I’ve had the staff screw up before when doing pricing, and if we put the wrong LOWER price tag on something, that’s what I’m going to sell it to you for. I also know that unless it’s an **ADVERTISED** price, I don’t **LEGALLY** have to do it, but if I screwed up, I’m going to eat that mistake and re-price the item after we’re done.  (Side note to Josh C. - Happy birthday today! And next time, pay attention to the damn price list when you’re using the price gun, because I know most of these screw-ups have your name on them. Also, go back to school and don’t do drugs).

ME:  Are you telling me that legally, even if we screwed up, I can’t have the cashier fix a mistake and that I have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register?!?

ALG:  Yes!

ME:  (looking at my dad) I guess we’re going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in.

I calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart, a small fountain with a price tag of $9.95, and continued calling out the prices. When we were all done, my dad gave him the total.

ALG:  That can’t be right! That’s way too much! There’s no way I got that much stuff!

DAD:  Oops! Looks like the fountain rang in for $995.95. Did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card?

ALG just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix it.

We happily fixed both mistakes, boxed up his items, and sent him on his way with a smile.

Lprsti99,137,,394,1947ml,,2065,"Quick backstory: I've been working at a grocery store for nearly 6 years now (started when I was 16).  The first four months or so I was a bagger, then the managers had me crosstrained as a cashier.  This story occurred about a week after that training.  

Guy walks into my line, and in his rather large order is a large pack of chicken legs.  It's one of the last items I ring up, and as soon as I scan it, he goes off, saying that the associate in the market had told him it would be a different, cheaper price.  He's pissed, so I apologize and call my manager, but he evidently wants to go bitch at the associate who told him the price, so he grabs the pack and starts storming off towards the back.  With his order still sitting in front of me.  With a line of about ten people behind him.  I'm not sure what to do, but before I can do anything, the 5'-nothing lady (who was behind him in line) turns, and at the top of her voice, yells, ""HEY! Get the HELL back here and pay for your shit!""

Chicken guy stops dead in his tracks, then turns around and comes back.  He starts in on this lady, but he also starts paying for his order (as I recall, he wrote a check).  He's going on, ""Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again, you don't know who I am,"" and she's giving it right back, ""I don't give a fuck who you are, you don't walk off like that, you see this line?""  

It continues like that, them at each others' throats, and poor me just trying to finish the order and stay unnoticed.  Finally his order finishes, and he snatches his shit up and say ""I'll be waiting for you outside, bitch.""

She looks him dead in the eye, and says, in a supremely unconcerned voice, ""You go right ahead, I carry a gun in my handbag, motherfucker,"" and then turns to me, and as if nothing's happened, smiles and says, ""Hi there.  Could I have a pack of Marlboro's, please?"" Chicken guy  slunk off quietly, and, judging by the lack of gunshots after the lady walked out, quietly went home.","""Get the HELL back over here and pay for your shit!""",2459,talesFromRetail

I'm currently running a register for the store when a guy comes up from the back with a large 60"" TV and a coworker. 

**Coworker:** Can you help ring this guy out? The registers in electronics went down.

**Customer:** How is it that the electronics area at these stores always have technical problems with their registers?

**Me:** HAHAHA, trust me if I knew I probably wouldn't behind the registers.

As we go through the process of ringing up the customer, the TV is placed behind the register and out of sight so I can scan it. 

**Customer:** Oh wait...

The customer grabs a soda from the Fridge at the register and scans it just as another customer walks up.

**Me:** Okay, that will be 602 dollars. 

**Customer 2:** WHAT!?!?

Me and the customer look up and noticed the look on the woman's face as the first customer gets out his credit card.

**Customer 1:** (Without missing a beat) Yeah. The price of Soda shot through the roof last night. The stuff is like liquid gold now.

He frowned a bit as he slid his card.

**Me:** Thank you, sir. (I slide the TV out) And here is your free TV for purchasing that Soda.

The 2nd customer realizes what was going on and starts laughing.

**Customer 2:** I was gonna say! 

We all start laughing.

IronyJudge,242,,1192,1qbhl2,,2017,"I'm my store's primary know-it-all and customer service specialist. I got the position because I'm pretty good at dealing with customers who are dumb and being good at gently telling them why. They're usually thankful at the end of the exchange. I make an effort to be polite about it despite how stupid they are.

Occasionally this flies entirely out the window. 

A guy came in looking for a flea collar. I bring him to the aisle and start off with the normal questions.

Me: ""So, how big is the dog?"" This is the most important question to nearly every interaction.  
Terrible Parent: ""It's not for my dog.""  
Me: ""Ah, alright, well we can head over to the cat section.""  
TP: ""No no, it's for my kid.""  
Me: ""How so?""  
TP: ""I'm going to put the collar on my 1 year old kid. The dog has fleas and the kid pets the dog. This would keep them from hopping over, right?"" 

Again, I am very good at being nice to people who have misguided thoughts. Then, there are people who are about to kill their kids.

Me: ""On your kid."" No longer in a friendly tone.  
TP:  Hesitant ""... yes?""  
Me: ""*DO NOT DO THIS. The poison in the collar will get into the kid's skin, poison him, and possibly kill him. You at the very least will end up in the ER.*""  
TP: ""It can't be that bad right? You put it on dogs.""  
Me: ""Dogs have a layer of fur separating them from the collar. That, and adult dogs have better resistance to the poison than a small child.""  
TP: ""So I can't put it on my kid.""  
Me: ""You might kill your child if you do so.""

At this point he's pale as a ghost. I then go into the standard flea treatment lecture. He willingly gets what I suggest and assures me he'll follow the directions to the letter.

After he leaves my General Manager comes up to me looking annoyed.

GM: ""Why did you yell at a customer?""  
Me: ""He was about to kill his kid over some fleas.""  
GM: ""Wait, what?""  
Me: ""He was going to put a flea collar on a 1 year old child.""

Smelly Snatch &amp; Mannequin Molester

The most shocking to me was when this older couple (50-60) came in reeking of black and milds and booze (more so the wife than the husband). The wife who had scraggly blonde hair, missing teeth, loose skin dripping everywhere from a recent weight loss and all around bad personal hygiene asked me to fit her for a bra cause it had been upwards for 10 years since she had bought a bra, always willing to help I happily agreed. We go into the fitting room and before I know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long (and i mean loooooong) tangled underarm hair so I measure her, tell her size and she seems delighted. So I leave her in the room and I go select a couple bras for her, once I leave the room I see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse. I let it go and go on the hunt for bras, while I'm looking he then starts yelling, quite loudly i may add, at how much would I be willing to sell the ""pretty young blonde"" for. I politely told him they weren't for sale etc etc but he still kept asking, caressing, and even sniffing the life sized mannequin. So I smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife. When I got in there she asked since I had measured her bust would I kindly measure her waist and hips cause she'd like to know, once again I agreed with a smile. I was at her waist told her the number and she got so excited (ya know cause of the weight loss). I squatted down do reach her hips and BOOOOOM. She pulls down her elastic banded mum jeans, to reveal her large flurry, matted muff. About 4inches in front of my face was this woman's vagina, she was not wearing underwear...Obviously I couldn't do anything to upset her (sensitive job and whatnot) so I continued measuring around the sagging skin, trying not to touch anything I didn't have to and then the smell hit me. It was that old foosty, musty, old sock smell mixed with a fish market and some strong perfume. I held my breath and told her the measurement and stood up so fast I got a head rush. I then left her to her own devices to try on and went to get some sanitizer for my hands. Of course the husband was still chatting up the mannequin but I just smiled and nodded at him and went about my business til she was done.

TL;DR Old foul smelling couple comes in for a fitting, husband feels up/molests the mannequins and I get face time with the wife's vagina.

Trash Can Shit Storm

It's my second week on the job, getting the swing of American retail, learning how often to say ""ya'll"", so it's going well. I'm serving this adorable old woman she's super nice, gave her a coupon that i didn't have to give her, she's happy as a clam. She leaves the register and I turn around to get a drink of water and to look on the receiving bar (which has loads of clothes on it to be put away) but still in a good mood from awesome customer. I turn back around and that sweet little old lady is charging at me like a rabid bull. Her face is stern, strained and bright beetroot red. I . AM. FUCKING. SCARED. (so scared I have to pee). I though I had made a mistake on her receipt as she is holding it high in the air with the other hand gripping her purse for dear life. I don't know what to do so I freeze, like a bloody deer in the headlights. After what seems like an eternity or this crazed woman coming at me she makes it to my register. I try to ask her how I could help her again/ if I made a mistake and it's obvious I am invisible to her. She doesn't stop AT the register she makes her way around it beside me pulls out the little blue trash can from my left hikes up her skirt, drops her tights and fucking EXPLODES into that poor wee unsuspecting trash can. What do I do? I stand there staring at her looking gormless. I have no idea what to do, or what the protocol even is for a shit situation. She starts profusely apologizing and stating that she couldn't make it the extra 20ft to the toilets....I come around to my senses get on the phone, call a manager and page housekeeping. I felt so bad for the housekeeping women she's so nice and funny...We still used that trash can, it even survived a store remodel...it was still there to my left on the day I quit.

TL;DR Sweet adorable old lady shits a fountain into my unsuspecting trash can. Same trash can still there and in daily use.

Shameless Pooper.

Busy day. Running around covering 2 departments cause we're short staffed and scheduling manager is an idiot. Carrying an arm load (about 16-21) bras from the fitting room to my counter, the lingerie department is a mess and I'm all by myself (as usual). In the middle of all the questions from customers, calls on the phone, passing comments of associates...I see it in the middle of the pathway around the store right in front of the bathroom entrance (about 5 ft) and inbetween my register and the home store register. A small slight Asian man about 48-52ish unbuckling his trousers, pulling them down along with his undergarments, revealing his flaccid willy, squats down and starts to poop. In front of customers and associates just keeps going. It is not a small pile, I have horses so I know piles of shit, this was a horse sized shit for a small sized man. His wife/older daughter (30s 40s?) turns teh corner, sees him and starts screaming at him and drags him to the loo with the trousers around his ankles. Leaving the pile. So my manager sees and orders me to guard the tower of poop on one side and my coworker on the other. I am being paid $10/hr to guard a pile of shit...The smell is moving quickly and customers are freaking out but they are all stopping for a good 10 seconds a piece to stare and marvel at the giant piece of fecal matter. It takes forever for housekeeping to show up but I am grinning ear to ear because my boss is a douche, we clash all the time, she is a moron. I don't even care about the smell cause I am watching her hang onto a fixture of guy fieri pans holding her nose and throat while gagging.

Turns out the wife/older daughter was the bad guy of the story not the small man. Small man needed the toilet, they sent him on his way alone, he didn't know where it was and not only that he'd had a stoke a day or two before and they had left him BY HIMSELF in a place he didn't know. So he wasn't all there. When they eventually came out of the bathroom they were screaming at him and he just looked like he had no idea hat was going on. So what'd they do left him alone (again) and wandered off down to the ladies dept to check out the clearance &gt;.&lt; I wandered down to check on the man but he'd wandered outside. So being on the clock I couldn't follow.

TL;DR Guy shits on floor, not his fault, uncaring family.


The Birth of Titty Sling Gurl

It was a slow Sunday, about 20 minutes before the after lunch church crowd usually comes in, and I was dressing a couple mannequins in some bathing suits (opposite side of the bra dept). So there I am elbow deep in some mannequin arse trying to hike on a pair of neon orange and pink bikini bottoms. For the record I am 5'2 and these mannequins are at least 6ft tall maybe more. So of course I look like I am humping this mannequin while I'm really trying to make sure it's arms and legs don't fall off and that's when I hear it.

""Hellluurrrrr???""

I look up and the expression on my face can only be described as ""WUT?""

""Hellllurrrrrr??? Yo bra ladeeeee???""

I wave my hand and tell this voice I'll be right with her and to give me a second.

Apparently a second is too long. She comes storming up through the swimwear racks, and I get my first look at Shamu. I say Shamu, not because of her size but the wave bathing suits are flying off her like waves off a small child. She's about 5'6, 300-350lbs, long neon green nails, dew rag paired with a weave that appeared to be falling out, leggings, a black shirt that had cut out holes in the back and an arse that was as big as the boot of my car. She was quite a woman.

I dropped the mannequin and smiled while cheerily stating my apologies for the wait and how could I help her.

Her reply went as follows, "" Is this where I get da tittay slings""

Trying not to laugh I tell her yes and ask if she knows what size she needs.

""I dunno my tittay size but I don't want you to be touchin all up on my tittays, that's wrong forreal.""

So i politely tell her how the fitting process works and she eventually agrees and she leaves happily with her new bras. Until a week later she returns with what I believe is her mother? And yells across the department, ""HEEEY HEEEY DAS HER!!! DAS HER!!! THE TITTAY SLING GURRRL!!!""

Tl;DR I am the ""tittay sling gurrl""

smedwards,276,,986,1hozyk,,1968,"I saw another thread on here earlier about customers assuming retail workers are stupid or unintelligent because of the field we work in and it reminded me of something that happened a few years ago when I was working in my senior year of high school. 

I was working at a local chain bakery in a fairly upscale neighbourhood one Saturday when this happened. For some backstory, in our store our manager always told us to ask a lot of questions when people just asked for ""bread"" because otherwise customers had a habit of returning later and complaining/trying to score free stuff. I'm not talking a *lot* of questions either, it was literally stuff like ""seeds or no seeds, brown or white bread, thick or thin slice?"" and we always moved and worked while talking so we could provide fast service.

One day I was working alone and this guy came in, clearly in a massive hurry. He was the only customer so I was doing my best to be courteous and get his items bagged up quickly for him, asking the usual questions when he looks up and snaps at me. ""Are you fucking stupid or something? I just want a loaf of bread. You'd better work on your customer service skills because it looks like you'll be in sales for the rest of your life."" At this point I'm kind of in shock because I was honestly just going through the usual routine and trying to work quickly for him and no one had ever said anything like that to me at work before. Never mind the fact that I had good results in school and was on track to law school, I was totally stumped about what to say to him, whether to defend myself or just take it. That's when this voice pipes up from over the man's shoulder. It's my English teacher and he says ""Actually, this cashier is a student of mine and in the top 5% of her grade, you absolute dick."" The man looks flabbergasted, slaps his money down on the counter and stalks off with his loaf of bread. I just looked at my English teacher and he smiled, apologised for swearing and kept walking with his coffee. 

EDIT- There seems to be some confusion when I say ""law school."" In Australia, you can go straight from high school to an undergraduate Bachelor of Laws. I meant my predicted high school results were high enough to get me into my preferred university for that course. And yes, the main point of contention for my story has almost nothing to do with my story...

calladus,254,,564,1g7s1a,,1960,"Really... I had no idea.

I was checking out of the local home supply warehouse, and used my store credit card for my purchase - which consisted of a couple of pallets of fencing materials.

The cashier didn't look like she was new.  This particular store has everyone wearing orange vests, and they are encouraged to decorate them.  Hers was starting to look a little shabby, but had lots of colored drawings of flowers all over it.  She'd been here for a while.

And she was wooden.  She was doing her job quickly and efficiently, but I might as well had been invisible.  No eye contact, no talk, no life.  Taking my cue from her, after my initial ""hello"" I stayed quiet.

When I pulled out my store credit card, she asked me if she could see my ID too.  

I've been the victim of identity theft before.  My credit cards have my signature, and a ""see ID"" on the back.  Even now I have a fraud alert on my credit.  

So I'm VERY happy when cashiers ask to see my ID, and I ALWAYS tell them ""thank you"" in a cheerful manner.

""Thank you so much for asking!"" I said as I pulled out my ID, ""I'm always so glad when a cashier asks!  I know people give you crap for it, but it really does mean a lot to me.  So thank you.""

And she started crying!  It wasn't like she was bawling, but her eyes teared up and her voice got that tremulous tone we have all experienced at some point in our lives.

There weren't any other customers, so we talked for a few minutes about how terrible customers can be, and she regained her composure again.  Apparently another customer had read her the riot act for something or another (I'm not sure what) and it had really hurt her.

I've told her about /talesfromretail - maybe we will see her here. ",I was a customer... and I made the cashier cry.,2524,talesFromRetail
hulkrules22085,402,,714,1mnpfi,,1884,"So, there have been a few stories on here recently about rude, annoying and just plain mean customers getting what they deserve. I'm gonna join in.

This story happened a few years ago. I wasn't the employee, but rather just a spectator. A friend and myself went to a local fast food restaurant and went to the drive-thru and got some ice cream. We decided that we'd park the car in the lot and eat since we didn't want it to melt (nor did we feel like going inside).

Anyway, we got out and sat on the trunk of my car where we had a direct view of the drive-thru. Suddenly, this one gentleman with a woman as his passenger pulls up to the windows in a very nice looking convertible and starts making really derogatory comments to the employees in the windows. Like, REALLY derogatory.

""What's it feel like to have a shitty job?""
""Do you smell like french fries all the time?""
""My salary pays for you illegals to come here and work! I should get this food for free!""
""Yes, that's a ten dollar bill! Have you ever seen one?""

Even if he was joking, it was really inappropriate and we felt bad for all the workers. So anyway, he gets his food and pulls into a spot close to me where he begins to inspect the bag's contents. I guess looking for one more thing to berate them about.

Suddenly, the car that was behind him pulls out of the drive-thru and parks next to him. The guy in the other car shouts ""HEY!"" The jerk looks over. We look over. And the gentlemen proceeds to throw his large vanilla ice cream with Oreos and M&amp;M's right into the convertible. It's everywhere. On the man, his girl, the seats, the dashboard, EVERYWHERE.

The man is dumbfounded. Speechless. He looks over at the other man with an angry look and is about to say something when the other man says, ""Learn how to be a decent human being you f---ing a--hole! How dare you make fun of people for no reason! Who do you think you are?""

The other man drives off. The jerk drives off, still covered in ice cream. Me and my friend are now speechless as well. We finish our ice cream and go. Smiling all the way home.",I agree. It's nice to see evil people get what they deserve.,2598,talesFromRetail
reggie2319,250,,578,1jx1n4,,1797,"So this didn't actually happen to me, but to a coworker.

I work for an attraction in a tourist town that hires high schoolers for summer jobs. A couple of days ago we had a group of elderly men and women come in to play our miniature golf course.

Now, this day, we had one of the high schoolers running the register. We shall call her Mouse, because she's very quiet and timid.

The first old man walks up to the counter, and very quickly says ""one for mini-golf."" Mouse says ""okay, sir, that will be 11.99.""

Old man replies with ""what about the senior discount?"" Now, we don't have a senior discount, but if you're nice, we will normally give the local discount, 50 percent off.

Mouse says ""I'm sorry sir, we don't have a senior discount, but I can-""

At this point the old man loudly interrupts with ""WELL WHAT KIND OF S*** IS THAT? DON'T YOU SUPPORT SENIORS?""

Now, you should understand that our demographic is families with young children. So there are kids everywhere.

He stares at Mouse with a smirk on his face. What followed surprised me. Mouse looked him straight in the eye (thank God for the elevated cash wrap, because she's like five feet tall, and otherwise would have had to crane her neck to do it.), and says ""that will be 11.99."" He starts in again, she interrupts with ""that will be 11.99."" Every time he opens his mouth, she just says ""that will be 11.99.""

The look of utter defeat as he handed his money over was very satisfying.

So this is a big supermarket, and very busy. The express checkout was set out in such a way that everybody lines up in one long queue and gets called to the next available register.

It's the middle of summer, so it's hot, like 45°C/115°F+. There's one poor mum, with a toddler who has been a little jerk all through the store, tantrums, screaming, the whole bit. Terrible twos or some such.

Mum and kiddo line up in the express queue, kid still shrieking, and Mum has enough. It's hot, she's tired, she's over it. She gives the kid a swift smack on the bottom. The screaming stops, and Mum gets a few moments of piece.

The woman behind her sniffs, and says very haughtily: ""In Germany, we don't smack our children.""

Mum turns around and yells at her: ""Yeah, well in Australia we don't gas our fucking Jews!""

FredFltStn,147,,748,1mku1r,,1777,"The main story happened to me a few weeks ago, but I was reminded about it last night and wanted to share.

A few weeeks ago, I went to get a few things from the grocery store a couple of blocks from my house. I like to shop late in the evening. It’s generally a little cooler outside (still summer in Florida) and I don’t have to fight the crowds.

I grab the things that I need and head for the checkout. It’s around 8:45pm and the store closes at nine. There are only a few people shopping and there are two checkout lanes open. I’ve got around 20 things, so I can’t do the 10 items or less lane, but no big deal because I’m not really in a hurry. There are three people in front of me in the regular line, so I pull up my cart and wait. Of course I realize just about then that I’ve forgotten toilet paper. I could make due if I’d forgotten just about anything else, but TP was a must have. I left my cart and walked two aisles over to grab some. 

When I got back (all of 60 seconds later), my cart had been moved to the closed lane and there was a woman with a MONSTER cart of stuff standing where I had been. I was a little agitated, but hey, I wasn’t there and it was probably my fault for just leaving my cart there unattended. Brushed it off, grabbed my cart and got back in line behind the new person. She turned around game me the dirtiest look. Seriously! Not a quick one either! She had slowly turned and stared at me for a good 5 seconds like I’d just loudly passed gas or cursed at her, and then did the slow turn back to her cart. I actually wondered what the hell I had done, then decided to ignore it and started playing WW Friends on my phone to kill the time.

Meanwhile, mean face (MF) lady has started to pile her crap up on the belt. After a bit, I hear her making these harrumphing sounds and I look up. There’s now one person paying in line, one person waiting with her stuff using about half of the belt, and MF. MF has piled up her stuff like a Jenga game on the remainder of the conveyer belt and I’m guessing is now pissed off that the line isn’t moving. Back to the game and ignoring MF.

It’s finally MF’s turn. She’s got her coupons out and is questioning the poor girl who’s ringing up the stuff on damn near everything as she scans it. Because of that, it’s taking FOREVER. The girl on the 10 items or less lane doesn’t have anyone and offers to take me, but I’ve already got my stuff on the belt, so I tell the person behind me to go ahead and go. MF has all of her stuff scanned but is now arguing with the cashier because one of the items that she purchased did not wring up at the sale price. The cashier was explaining that the item in question was not on sale. There was a similar item that was, but MF did not get that item, she chose a different one. MF shoves a sale flyer at the cashier to show her and the cashier points out her mistake and offers to let her get the other item. MF is now and a full blown rant and yells that the item on sale is the store brand and it’s not as good as brand X that she’s picked out, so cashier should honor the sale price anyway.  MF is just berating this poor girl who’s the cashier, and It looks like she’s about to break down. Cashier calls for a manager to do the override, but he’s apparently not getting there fast enough for MF. And that would be when I lost it. I leaned in broke into the conversation.

ME:  Excuse me. Are you functionally illiterate or just stupid?

MF:  What!

ME:  If you want the sale price, then buy the sale item. 

MF:  I’m going to have you arrested!

Manager gets there right then. Cashier tells the manger what MF wanted. Manager tells her to take a break and she leaves in tears. Manager apologized to MF and tells her they will honor the discount.

ME:  Don’t give her the discount. That just encourages idiots like her. 

Manager doesn’t even acknowledge me. Gives her the discount (seriously like $1.95), and helps her outside with her groceries.  MF is raging the whole time about how terrible this store is. Cashier from the 10 items or less lane comes over to check me out and I leave, disgusted by the entire thing.

Fast forward:  
Last night I go to the same grocery store to pick up a few things. When I get up to the cashier to check out, she looks at me and asks, “Are you functionally illiterate or just stupid?” 

I look up shocked and she’s laughing. It’s the girl who was on the 10 items or less lane. She told me that they were all laughing at my comment that night after they had closed, even the manager. She said that MF had sent a letter and wanted me banned from the store. Manager had tossed the letter and they’d all had another laugh at MF. Left with a big smile on my face. Definitely my grocery store of choice now.",Customer tries to get me banned from the store because I stood up to her,2525,talesFromRetail
jetblacklungs,215,,625,1nm96m,,1744,"   So, this just happened a few days ago. I apologize for the wall of text, but it's warranted for the story.

   I manage a shipping store that loves the color brown. We have 3 employees, and we do the typical packaging and shipping that you would expect, along with copies, printing, etc. As an additional source of revenue, we have private contracts to do fingerprinting for two different agencies that run background screenings. People in certain lines of work in our state (medical, child care, education, etc.) are REQUIRED BY LAW to have these background screenings done before starting a new job and after every 5 years of employment. 
   People are registered with one of these two agencies, make payment to them, and are then sent to us with a registration number form to have their fingerprints collected. We collect the fingerprints digitally on equipment provided to us by the agencies, and they are then electronically submitted to the background check agencies who, in turn, send them to the FBI and our state law enforcement agency for processing. We then sign off on their registration number form and tell them to hold onto it in case there are any problems. I should also mention that these screenings are quite expensive to register for, but we are only paid a small commission by the agencies for each person we fingerprint. We are also the ONLY place in the area to have this done for these agencies.
    No we do a LOT of fingerprinting here, easily 20-30 people a day between the two agencies, and it can get quite the disruptive to handling of other business in the store when you’ve only got 3 people working . We have lots of strict guidelines that we are required to abide by for fingerprinting, so before we start, we simply give folks a rundown of what we are going to do and what we need them to do to get them finished as quickly as possible. Most people cooperate, some do not. Some are just downright rude about it. If someone isn’t cooperating with what we need them to do (keeping relaxed, not trying to roll their fingers themselves, etc.) we will ask them again a few times to cooperate. If they are rude about it or still don’t cooperate, then we just do what we need to do to get them finished and out the door. If you're fingerprints are deteriorated or damaged, or if you were just uncooperative and didn’t allow us to get clear prints, the prints can be rejected by the FBI or state law enforcement agency as unreadable. If this happens, they send you a rejection number, and then you have to come back with that and your original registration number, and get them done all over again. This is where our story begins.
   I am at the counter helping customers when this woman walks in. You know those people who you can just look at and instantly tell that they are going to have a bad attitude? This was one of them, so we’ll just cal her Bad Attitude (BA).

Me – “Hello, how are you today?”

BA – “Here” *thrusts random paper at me

Me - *take paper, see scribbled number on paper “Okay, let’s see what we’ve got here. Ah, it looks like you need to be fingerprinted again” 

BA – *in extremely condescending tone “Uh, YEAH”



Me – “Okay, do you have your original registration ID”

BA – *SIGH ,*condescending tone “NO, why don’t you just look it up”

Me - “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any way to do that. I don’t have access to the agencies systems to search for your information. We simply enter your registration number to pull up your appointment.”

BA – “whatever, I don’t care, JUST DO IT”

Me – “I won’t be able to do anything without your registration number”

BA - *snatches paper from me “THIS IS F*CKING RIDICULOUS!!!”

Me – “Okay, well that was unnecessary.” 

BA – starts stomping out“YOU PEOPLE SHOULD’VE JUST DONE YOUR F*CKING JOB!!!”

I’ve had it with this lady at this point

Me – “alright then, you have a lovely day”

BA – “YEAH! YOU TOO ASSHOLE!!!”

   At this point she walks out the door. Mind you, this all happened in front of other customers. I apologize to them for her language.  
   One of my associates, M, begins telling me that he was the one that fingerprinted her originally. He tells me that she was very uncooperative and was just as rude when he had dealt with her. I then tell M and my other associate, D, that if she comes back in to let me handle it. I plan on refusing her service, and asking her not to return to the store. 
    I am just finishing up with a customer when M motions toward the door. BA is coming back in and she’s talking to someone on the phone. She walks up to the counter and thrusts her phone at me. I know what’s going on here. Bad move lady.

BA – “HERE, TALK TO THEM” *starts muttering about how stupid we are

Me – “Hello this is Jetblacklungs, I’m the store manager”

Phone – “Hello, this is Derpina. I’m the HR director for Blabiddy Blah Health Care Center. I understand that there’s a problem with BA’s fingerprinting, what information did you need.”

Me – “Well, we needed to have her registration ID to collect her finger prints again, but at this point I’m not going to be able to complete this for her.”

Phone – “What is the issue?”

   BA is standing directly across the counter from me, with a slightly puzzled look on her face. I look her dead in the eyes as I continue speaking…

Me – “When she came in earlier, and I asked her for the information I needed she became very rude and combative, telling me that my request was ‘effing ridiculous’ and that we ‘should’ve done our effing jobs’, before calling me an A-Hole from across the store on her way out. This was all done in front of several customers in my store. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior, and I will not allow her back into this store.”

  A look of horror, and plain old “oh sh!t” flashes across BA’s face.

BA – “well you started it!”

   I give her a look that just says “bitch, please”.

Phone – “Oh my god, I am SO sorry. I apologize for this. I completely understand. Please know that we will definitely handle this, and she will NOT be back in your store. Could you please put BA back on the phone. Again, I am so sorry for this.”

  BA is standing there mouth agape, looking like someone just ran over her puppy. I hand her phone back and say “She wants to talk to you, you can leave my store now.”  She turns to walk out, and puts the phone back to her ear. I’m listening with delight as she walks out.

BA – “Hello….Yeah I….b-but…well he star….but I can’t….no wait, please….Hello? HELLO?”

   She glares back at me. I just wave and say “Bye!” Haven’t seen her since.

PardayTarday,312,,415,179hky,,1751,"A couple of days ago, I was pulling a double shift (9 AM-close) and it was serene - four or five customers, six associates in the store, just another Tuesday in retail. We're across the street from a mixed-income neighborhood, so a lot of our customers come from there. Lot of nice people, some non-English speakers, but people who are super nice and make the job fun.

Around 815 PM, three teenage boys started to ride around the parking lot in their bikes. We don't think much of this - it's a large parking lot, filled with many stores (such as Sprawl Mart). We start picking up the carts from the parking lots as the three boys walk into the store, playing with the laptops and tablets, then the cameras. Fine, whatever we thought, we're almost closed, so be it.

Then they entered the small electronics department and started to knock things over - throwing down iPad cases on the floor, putting the music on loud and cursing at each other, running around the television area and putting terrible things on the smart tv's (websites with pornographic images, loud music - NOTE: We never blocked websites on the smart TV's, but now we do, we never thought this would happen.""

My manager comes over, talks to them, but as he does, they start calling him names - ""Old Man McGee"" (our boss' last name is McGee) - as well as attempting to push around the vacuums and knocking things over. Our manager, a patient man who we never heard raise his voice, yelled ""LEARN SOME GODDAMED MANNERS AND GET OUT!""

The boys laughed and gave up, and walked out the store as we cleaned up the mess they left us (especially one in the furniture area, who peed on the recliners). At close, as we were removing the recliners and marking ""Defective Merchandise - Move to Atlanta"" on each of them, a woman banged on our doors (they were locked) and screams ""OPEN YOUR DOORS!"" My manager walked up to the door and pointed to his watch, ""We're closed ma'am. We'll be open at 10 AM tomorrow for your shopping convenience.""

But then we see those three boys as well around her, banging on the doors. The manager opened the doors slowly, and as the woman tried to push herself in, our manager blocked her entrance. ""Ma'am, we're closed. And your boys left us a mess, so even if we were open, we wouldn't let you in. One of your boys peed on the recliners, which is going to lose us money on each one. We have to order new ones and tell corporate what happened to each one."" 

The mom kept pushing on the manager and the doors, then yelled, ""YALL DON'T YELL AT MA KIDS! THEY GOOD, YALL EVIL! THEY JUST EXPRESS THEMSELVES! YALL EVIL AND BAD AND WE WILL YALL MANAGERS."" Our manager, in a smug voice, says, ""Sure ma'am, call corporate, but we have so much evidence against your boys."" One boy kept screaming over us ""I AINT GOIN' BACK TO JUVIE!"" NO WAY! AINT GOING BACK TO JUVIE. MAMA I AINT GOING BACK."" 

Next morning, we open up at 10 AM, and who's the first customer - Mama Crazy! The store is quiet, a lot of us had just pulled doubles, and so everyone is tired and just waiting for the day to end. The same manager from the night before is there, and she walks up to him, huffing and puffing. ""LEMME SEE THOSE RECLINERS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YALL TRYING TO PUT MY BOYS IN JUVIE AND THEY ALL I HAVE."" My manager walks the woman to the warehouse, and we follow. He shows her the photos of what her boys have done, and then showed her the recliners, lined up, marked defective. 

""HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PEE ON IT? HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T STAGE THIS BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE MA KIDS? THIS IS A WITCH HUNT, MA BOYS AINT GOING TO JUVIE, YALL GOT NO PROOF. I LOVE MY BOYS!"" Our manager walks her out, and as she leaves, he says, ""We are pressing charges ma'am. We have every camera, every photo, and six associates who saw what happened. We'll see you in court.""

Not_A_CEO,124,,654,1odkne,,1723,"Hey TFR.  I've got a good one for you today, and I still get giddy thinking about it.

I work at a bank, and this occurred about four years ago.  We had a customer come in slightly upset: someone had broken into his car and stolen only a few checks from his checkbook, and had immediately gone on a spending spree at nearby grocery stores (the kind where they use your check to pull the funds out immediately, identical to a debit card).  Our manager immediately refunded the lost money and put a *""Warning""* on his account telling us not to cash any check numbered from 1001 to 1010: the numbers of the stolen checks. He was assured that any more money he lost would be refunded.  He didn't want to close the account (which is what I would have recommended) because it takes a while to get new checks and cards, and he didn't want to go through all the trouble.

Not 2 days later, we have what's called a Non-Customer walk in (meaning they don't have an account at that bank, but still have transactions to run, most often cashing checks).  I'm currently covering for several coworkers lunches, so I'm the only Teller covering the lobby.  He walks up to me, hands me a check and his I.D., and tells me he wants to cash it.  Alright, cool, let me just check th--whoa, wait a minute.  *This is a check that was stolen from that customer a few days ago!*

I doubled and triple checked my suspicions, and I was rewarded with numerous red flags:

• The check number was within the stolen range (1001 to 1010)

• The signature was *clearly* forged, and was easily the most damning evidence

• The amount of the check was for an absurdly high amount based on the ""Babysitting Job"" description scrawled down in the memo line; the check was for $3000.

We, the tellers, had been instructed to call the police in the event that anyone ever came in an presented a forged check (and also had strong reason to believe that the person in front of us had done the forging).  The dude in front of me was covered from head to toe with tattoos, smelled like an ashtray, dressed in the dirtiest clothes you can imagine, and had the words ""Fuck Off"" tattooed on his right forearm in very large, very easy-to-read letters.

In other words, I was calling bullshit on him cashing a $3000 check based on his babysitting work.

So, I needed to call the police, but how?  There was no way this guy would stick around the second I picked up the phone and accused him of stealing a check, not to mention the fact that this guy actually looked fairly dangerous.  Normal protocol said that I ""need a manager to verify the check,"" at which point I would go to the back room and call the cops--and stay back there, leaving the customer at the counter getting frustrated and suspicious.

So I improvised: I started angrily hitting the spacebar on my keyboard and muttered loud enough for the thief to hear me, ""Come on, not again.""  When he looked inquiringly at me, I scowled and said, ""Sorry, my system just froze up.  We've been having trouble with this stupid thing all day.  Let me see if I can get someone else to do it.""

I gave a *for-Christ's-sake-just-go-with-it* look at my only other coworker, who fortunately picked up on what I was doing immediately and complained that, sure enough, her system went down too.  I looked back up at the thief and apologized in a half-laugh, half-scowl that his wait would be a few minutes because our entire network had just gone down.  **He totally bought it,** even going so far as to say something like, ""Damn computers, they never work when you need them too, hahaha!""  I agreed, and told him I'd go back in the back room to get his cash ready, if nothing else.

I called the police, explained the situation to them, and they assured me a cop was on his way to our location, fast.  I hung up and called our corporate office and let THEM know what was happening, and they assured me that I was doing the right thing and that they were sending the bank lawyer to our location ASAP, and to ""be safe.""  I then called our branch manager (who was on lunch at this time) and then the customer and let them both know what was going on and that we'd keep them updated.

Once I was done with this stuff--I walked back out to the counter and walked right back up to the thief, apologized again for his wait, assuring him that we had our IT department working nonstop on the situation, and would he like a free soda to compensate for the wait?  He like that, so I went and got him one.  5 minutes later (and I was sweating bullets at this point, my body was swimming in adrenaline), the cop walked in, directly behind the thief, who was completely unaware of the whole situation.  I made eye contact with the cop, nodded, and then nodded again towards the thief.

Long story short: the thief turned around and completely went limp at the sight of cop.  He admitted to stealing the checks almost instantly and was promptly placed into handcuffs right there in our lobby.  Our bank lawyer (who was on the phone with the customer who'd had his checks stolen) and branch manager walked in a few minutes later after that.  After the thief was hauled off, I was told I had done well by upper management.

**The best part?**  Saying that our system was down became the company-wide go-to excuse whenever tellers needed to stall for time in order to call the police.

I am a gymnastics coach, and I generally love my job. I work with the upper level girls, the ones that go out and compete, even though I'm considered pretty young (college age) to be coaching teams. We're a pretty small gym and the parents are, for the most part, great to work with. But there is one. Ohhhhh there is always that one.

This mom, a woman who takes pride in the fact that she is a children's therapist and basically a glorified tutor, is the most ""I'm their friend first, and their parent second."" person I have ever met in my life when it comes to her children. She brought her daughter, Entitled Mini Witch (EMW for short), to our program just under 4 years ago. Now, EMW is talented, but because her mother lets her get away with murder, she is one of the most lazy, rude, and miserable children I have ever had to work with. I am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break, and I just need to get this out of my system before going back for the team's second work out because I'm still livid.

I'm eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork, because it's easier for me to just stay there rather than drive all the way back home then all the way back to the gym, and there are no classes during the afternoon, so my boss is fine with it. This mother storms into the gym, marches straight up to the desk and says, ""Ginger24, I am absolutely shocked and appalled by what EMW told me today, but I know kids can exaggerate, so I wanted to come talk to you before going to [Owner]."" Awh shoot. I know exactly what's coming. 

This girl came to practice 20 minutes late, we were almost done with warm up, and she was being generally unpleasant. But its two-a-days, and mornings suck, so I was trying to be understanding. I got nothing but backsass and ""I can't do [event she doesn't like], my ankle hurts."" Yet, when we got to an event she enjoyed, she was magically healed. I was having none of it. But like the good little peon I am, I responded with, ""Oh, uhm, okay. What did EMW tell you about practice?"" 

**Mom**: ""She said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out. All practice! She was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to her""

Alright, now I'm kind of agitated, but I expected this kind of thing. This sounds like a typical case of a 13 year old girl who is blatantly manipulating her mother. Regardless, I know this family, and I know that trying to explain this would go in one ear, and out the other, so I respond in my most sickly-sweet customer service voice, ""Ah, well, I'm sorry EMW was crying after practice, but I was trying to keep her as healthy as possible. See, when she got here late I asked her to warm up on her own while we went to tumbling. As soon as she finished she got through two turns before complaining that her ankle hurt. I had her sit and ice it for 10 minutes, take the ice off for 5, then had her come try tumbling again. She said it still hurt, so I had her do the ""Leg/Ankle Injury"" conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a break.""

**Mom**: ""Okay, but then why didn't you let her do Trampoline?""

Understandable question, but I was so sick of this girl coming up to me, demanding to do trampoline, insisting that her ankle felt better, and that I was just a horrible, mean person, that I had had enough of the way she was treating me. I explained to the mother that, ""If the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in EMW's ankle so badly that she couldn't tumble, adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain. I didn't want her to further injure herself, so I had her finish the list.""

This is where it gets insane. This is where I legitimately expect to lose my stuffing. Her mom decided to inform me, ""EMW was just being dramatic. I'm sure her ankle wasn't as bad as it seemed, she just doesn't like tumbling. I'm sure you know that. She wanted to do trampoline though and I don't understand why you wouldn't let her just because she was pretending to get hurt.""

What? No, seriously, what? My mind was absolutely blown. I was so infuriated I was tempted to kick her out right then and there. But alas, I kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as I informed this mother, ""I'm sorry Mrs. [last name], here at [gym name] we take athlete health and injuries very seriously. I had no way of knowing whether EMW's ankle was barely twisted, or about to fall off. I had nothing but EMW's word to decide what to do. When an athlete says they are in that much pain, I cannot, in good conscience, allow them to further injure themselves. If EMW wants to be a part of gymnastics, she has to practice gymnastics. If she wants to be a part of trampoline, there is a [name of a business with wall to wall trampolines and a history of a lot of injuries that is pretty popular on the west coast] about 20 minutes away.""

She huffed out and said that EMW wasn't feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today. I asked that she make sure EMW gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door. I called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened. She just laughed and said she'd take care of it if she got a call. Sorry for the wall of text, and if there is somewhere better to put this please let me know, but I really just needed to get that out there.

**EDIT**: I realized some of you might not know what conditioning is. Its basically the strength part of gymnastics. Push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, things like that where you aren't actually doing anything completely gymnastics related, just focusing on building muscle and endurance.

**EDIT 2**: Obligatory ""Holy shit I'm on the front page!!!"" edit. But seriously, thank you to everyone who upvoted and everyone who commented. Y'all made my day so much better.

If anyone was wondering, second practice went very well, and we even played a game at the end of practice. One of the girls asked where EMW was, and I explained that she was resting her ankle. One of my other girls asked, ""You know she was faking, right?"" My only response was, ""I know"" and we moved on. Very good, very productive practice.

Everyone has had a co-worker like this, someone who is disrespectful to the bosses and who snaps at the customers. One of my bosses is Asian, yet born and raised in America, and she is incredibly nice. One day DB foolishly decided to belittle her because of her race in front of at least 10 customers, while simultaneously not getting their food. (McD lolberries.) 

Anyway I got a text from DB the following Sunday, asking if I can give him a ride to work as he missed the bus, DB told me if he doesn't come in they were going to fire him.

DB getting fired sounds petty good to me, so I told him I can't give him a ride. When I got to work later that day, I saw DB sitting in the lobby while my store manager is talking to him, turns out he found a way to work, and they fired him anyway. I later found out they only scheduled him to fire him! He was on for three hours, 5pm-8pm on Monday, and he didn't see anything weird with it! The Asian manager just wanted to see his face when he found out, so they had him come in. 

The store manager, being the nice person he is, gave him $3 for the bus, which Douche Baggins promptly used to buy a lottery ticket (if he lost he'd have to walk miles home, in the winter. He luckily won $20, yet used it to buy alcohol and get drunk in the lobby.

Our Asian manager happily kicked his ass out, he had no ride home. I also got a text from him a few weeks ago asking me for money, I didn't respond.

""So I heard that [bakery/café where I work] only puts their prettiest girls on the cash register,"" he sneered. His rotting fish breath hit me in the face. 

""What can I get for you today sir?""

""No, but there's one reward I WOULD like,"" he smirked and licked his lips. ""You have my number, but I'm not ordering until I get yours.""

FredFltStn,278,,741,1pm32e,,1685,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

Everything we sell is Buy 1 Get 1 Free (BOGO). We also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for Buy 1 Get 2 Free on any item up to $50. We also let you mix and match the items, so you don’t have to get three of the same things. I'm basically giving you an extra $25 in free fireworks just for showing up, in the hopes that you purchase more than that, and that you come back to see us every year.

The coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom. Can only be used on one item, cannot be reproduced, one offer per day, one offer per family our group, only valid on items up to $50, etc. 

I usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket, and I hand them out pretty freely when the store is open. I think it's a great promotional tool, and although it does impact my bottom line, I wouldn't think of getting rid of it.

As you can imagine, we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the coupon.

**SCAM 1**  There's a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons. Each time, it's the same routine. They'll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell. When they’re ready to checkout, the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately, each carrying their three items, and each with and a coupon. 

They each pay for one item, and get the other two for free. If we ask them if there together, which I've done before for laughs, they shake their heads and act like they’ve never met, even though they just spent the last hour shopping together. 

The very next day, they’ll show up and do the exact same thing.  Another hour of examining products, pick out three, walk to the counter separately, use their coupon. Even though they are technically scamming me, I always let it go, because frankly, I think it's funny as hell.

**SCAM 2**  Another regular customer. Every season, this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase. When he gets to the counter, he presents his coupon, and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item. He'll then spend 5 minutes arguing that I let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here. In the end, I’ll let him use it on two items, and he celebrates like he’s won the lottery. 

The thing is, he’s a regular, and he buys a shitload of fireworks. I’d probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didn’t have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out. I seriously think he does it just to feel like he’s gotten something over on us. 

**SCAM 3**  A lady walks up to the counter with a fountain ($19.95) and two massive assortments ($249.95) in her cart. I was standing behind the counter, so I went to ring her up. Before I could start, she handed me a coupon and this conversation took place.

**LADY:**  I’m just paying for the fountain, I’m going to use the coupon for the free items.

**ME:**  (wondering WTF she is thinking) I’m sorry, but the coupon is only good on items up to $50, and the free items have to be of equal or lesser value.

**LADY:**  It doesn’t say that anywhere on the coupon!

I look at the coupon and sure as hell, she’s right…because she’s cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legalese.

**ME:**  I’m sorry, but this coupon has been altered. It normally has all the details on the bottom (handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can see).

**LADY:**  That’s not my problem! My coupon doesn’t say that, so legally you have to honor my purchase.

**ME:**  (rudely, because WTF, really?) Yeah, that’s not going to happen. I don’t know what happened to your coupon (sure I don’t), but it’s been altered, and I’m not obligated to take altered coupons.

The lady is now full on yelling at me, insisting that I’m breaking the law, and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon. 

On this particular day (thank god), we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security. We do that on our busier days because it’s a great deterrent for theft, and it builds goodwill with the local police, since they make great extra money for a really easy gig (see [here](http://redd.it/1nkw27)). Besides, they love my mom’s Cajun cooking.

The lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about me.

Before she can say anything, the officer looks her in the eyes and says “One moment ma’am”, the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hear.

**OFFICER:**  Did you want me to arrest her or just throw her out?

**ME:**  It’s up to you. You’ve got to fill out the paperwork.

She left without another word.

BronyPrincess,83,,329,1g0eju,,1675,"Back in 2004, I had just started my first job at a very small gift store in my tiny home town. 

It was my very first day, and I was manning the register. 
My store manager, the only other person on shift, let's me know she will be gone for a 10 minute lunch break. If I need her, call her. 

Sure, I got this! 

10 minutes turned into an hour. Then two. Before I knew it three hours had passed, but I was doing well. No mistakes, figured she got held up with her kids or something. 

A customer purchases an item, $10.99. Pays by card. Cool. 
As I tap in the amount onto the machine, I realise in horror I have just charged this poor woman $109.99, and need to do a refund. 

I am upset, and explain to the customer that I will need to call my manager to do it, as it was my very first day. She is good natured and understanding. 

I call my boss on her mobile. No answer. Call again. No answer. Fuck. Try again. This time she picks up.
""What??""
Me: ""hi, it's ----, I've just made a mistake and need to make a refund on her credit card, but I need you to show me how and to approve it."" 
""Just get it out of the til. I'll fix it later.""
""Um, it's over $100, I don't have that much in the til.""
""Fuck, alright. Give me 5 minutes."" 

Boss hangs up, and I explain to the customer the wait. She is cool, understands 14 year old me has no real power. Cool lady. 

15 minutes pass, no sign of boss. Try to call, phone is off. I am starting to freak out and cry. Customer is cool, talks calmingly to me. Turns out she knows my mum (small town). She owns the new bakery, and has gotten to know everyone. Start joking around, relaxing with her. 

Nearly an hour later, boss rocks up stinking of sex. Even in my innocence I could see she was a mess. Shirt on backwards, makeup smudged, hair mussed. So mortifying. 

My boss rolls her eyes at the customer. 
""Can't get good workers these days, sorry about the idiot.""

I feel like I was slapped. Customer glared at this woman, this stinky boss, and then looks at me. 
""You start work in my shop at 9am. Want a ride home?"" 

I left with her, worked at her shop until I graduated in 2007, and moved away. Awesome woman. Life is sometimes very good. 
Tl:dr: customer becomes new employer. ",Manager is hopeless.,2004,talesFromRetail
Personsen,445,,652,1qvk5o,,1647,"[](/lyranotsure)I'm not a huge fan of coupons in general. There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired, they don't scan, or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up (which is a pet peeve of mine). If you want to use one or two coupons, I am fine with that. I completely understand wanting to save some money.

But there is a trend that pisses me off to no end.  

""Couponers"".  

A lady came in a while back, with a large amount of deodorant in her basket. After I finished ringing her up, she said,  
""Oh and I have a few coupons...""  

She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse.  None of them having scannable bar codes, meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually. I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to.  

She notices I am reading them and says ""Yeah. Those should pay for the entire transaction.""  

""I'm sorry, it says limit one coupon per customer and that they aren't to be used with any other coupons."" I reply.  

""No. I did the math. I have enough here to cover the entire transaction. In fact, you guys should technically be giving *me* cash back."" she says with a chuckle.  

At this point the line was piling up again on my register, so I called up a third cashier and the manager.  

The manager comes up and asks how he can help.  

She says ""Yeah this guy won't let me use my coupons.""  

I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons can't be used like this.  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for free.

Before she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her. She says ""You should be expecting more of us.  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here. Next time just scan the damn coupons"" She then struts out the door with a smile.  

The manager was fired soon after.  ","Fuck. ""Couponers"".",2299,talesFromRetail
zero_hunter,154,,438,1ei0r2,,1642,"Hello again, TFR! I posted a [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1eakwt/i_lost_my_purse/) a couple of days ago from my time working at a deli. While some crazy things happened every now and then, this is by far the craziest thing that has every happened to me while working there. Please bear with me, as this will be a little long.

This particular day I was working a double shift as a delivery driver. It was a couple of hours until my first shift ended, and two deliveries got called in. One delivery was pretty close to our location and the other was a little farther but still a pretty short drive.

*Easy*, I think to myself. *I'll take the farther one and drop of the closer one on the way back.* I came to find out that I'm glad I made that decision.

Everything goes relatively smoothly. I drop off the first one, arrive at the second, and knock on the door. I immediately hear what sounds like a small child yelling.

""MOOOOOMMM!!! HEEELLLLPP!!!""

*No biggie*, I think. *Some kid was horse-playing and probably fell down. I'm sure their mom will be here shortly and answer the door*.

So I wait. And wait. And wait some more.

I knock again and the screaming picks back up. Wait a minute or two, the screaming subsides. Knock again, the screaming picks up.

My mind starts to race. *Surely the mom will be here, right? Did she fall asleep? Is she even there??*

By now, every time I knock, the screaming gets more and more desperate. Like someone is in some serious pain. I even tried opening the door, but it was locked. I mull it over in my head a bit, and finally decide on what I need to do. I'll call 911. Even if it isn't an emergency, at least I can have the peace of mind that it wasn't anything bad. As an aside, I've hardly ever called 911, so I was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to call.

I call the dispatcher and tell them what's going on. I tell them that there's what sounds like a child yelling in this house, and they inform me that there's a unit close by who's on the way. Within 60 seconds, a police cruiser comes down the road. He comes up and I tell him what I told the dispatcher. 

He knocks and hears the screaming. Tries to get into the house but no avail, so he goes around to the back. By this point, a second cop shows up. And a third. 

The first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door. Turns out it was an older lady, not a kid like I thought. 

Shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road. Fuck. This might be pretty bad. Even worse was the fact that I parked in the driveway of this house, and the ambulance blocked me in, forcing me to stay. 

The firemen rush up to the door and bust it down. The paramedics rushed in after them, along with the cops. So now I'm outside by myself, waiting for them to finish... whatever it is they're doing so I can finally leave and get back to work. The entire time I'm worried that something is seriously wrong and felt helpless throughout the whole thing.

Finally, the paramedics come out with someone on a stretcher and load them up into the ambulance. One of the cops comes up to me and informs me that the lady living in this house recently has hip surgery, and while she was walking around the house she somehow displaced her hip, leaving her immobile and in a lot of pain. He told me it was a good thing I called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck there.

He gives me a congratulatory pat on the back, everyone loads up and leaves, and I finally make my way back to the deli. I get there, cash out, and go on my much needed break.

**Epilogue** - Later on during the night shift, the husband of the woman came in to pick up the food from earlier. As my coworker was helping him, she pointed me out as the one who called 911.

""You're the one who did that?""  
""Yes sir. I was really worried that something serious happened...""

He beams at me, shakes my hand while thanking me profusely, and hands me a few bucks for the trouble. In all honesty, he didn't even have to tip me. Just his face and reaction was a good enough tip for me.

FredFltStn,302,,760,1pgoim,,1631,"**BACKGROUND:**  I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

One of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down. She noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong, and wanted to let me know so we could fix it. We occasionally screw up (once again I'm talking about you Josh) and misprice stuff. When we do, we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault. We'll then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelf.

The item was a large mortar kit that retails for $169.95 (buy 1 get 1 free). The price tag on it said $49.95, so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our screw-up. I walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products, but they all seem to be ok, so I went back to helping other customers.

A minute later, I get flagged down again for another price check. It's another large item, and it's priced for less than half of what it normally sells for. I make a mental note to castrate Josh, then go to check out the remaining items. Once again they all seem to be priced correctly, but I did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag. I grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a sticker.

I barely finished putting a sticker on the item when I'm flagged down AGAIN! Now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are. She really starts to raise hell, so I apologize and tell her that we'll take care of the issue. I also remind her that even though the items were mispriced, we were giving them to her at the lower price.

I go to check the item on the shelf and once again, all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right. Now my spider sense is tingling. I walked back to the counter to “help” the cashier ring in the rest of the items.

Amazingly, I noticed that at ALL of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced. All of her large items, no matter what the original price, now have a price tag of $49.95. I stopped the transaction, looked the lady in the eye, and told her, “I'm not selling you anything, and you need to leave now”.

Do you remember the scene from the movie “The Exorcist” where Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) tries to expel the demon from Reagan (Linda Blair)? The scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that, but with less head spinning and more swearing.

I’m in my 40’s, and I honestly believe that I learned a few new words that day. She combined swear words and ethnic slurs that I’m fairly certain have never been used together before. She wove an amazing tapestry of obscenity, punctuated occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger. I think she could have honestly set some type of world record, but I apparently threw off her rhythm when I started applauding her performance.

I offered to call the police and have them sort it out, but she was apparently uninterested, and made a beeline for the door. The sad thing was, she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items. 

In retrospect, I really need to train my staff better. My cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items, but when I started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity, none of my staff joined in. I’ll be adding that to our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) before the upcoming New Years Eve.

She put the book on the counter and proceeds to tear the page. 

Me:  ""I must insist that you pay for the book first before you destroy it.""

BBB:  ""Huh?  I SAID I WAS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.  Did you think I wouldn't?""

Me: ""Ma'am, you're in a bookstore about to rip pages out of a book.  I think you could be capable of anything.""

anitathepita,286,,596,1nilpo,,1624,"I work at a bridal store. Bridezillas are a rarity (those are some fun stories), but the moms can get pretty bad.

Yesterday, a bride and her mother come in to try on some wedding gowns. As they were looking through the store, they spot the seamstress in the back of store pressing and steaming someone else's wedding gown. Now, there is a doorway and a curtain separating the front of the store from the back, where the main office is and where the seamstresses do their work. It's pretty clear only employees are allowed back there. But no, the mother just strolls back there, picks up the train of the dress while the seamstress is working on it, and says ""Oh honey, look at this one! This is gorgeous, you need to try it on."" I promptly hurry back there, because 1. that's an area she should not be in and 2. I really did not want her touching someone else's dress.

I tell her that it is indeed someone else's dress, her daughter cannot try that specific dress on, but I will gladly look in our inventory to see if we still have the gown. She seemed confused, but made her way back to the front of the store. I look it up, and turns out we don't have that dress as a sample because it came through a trunk show, which I tell her and then proceed to suggest similar styles we do have in stock. While the daughter accepted this fact, the mother got a bit hostile.

Mom: So if you don't have it, let her try that one in the back on.

Me: I'm sorry, but I can't. This is someone else's wedding gown that was specifically ordered for her.

Mom: So?

Me: ...so this is her dress, not a sample. We make a promise to our customers that their dresses will be safe and treated right.

Mom: Just let her slip it on, she'll be extra careful.

Me: Ma'am, this woman's wedding is this weekend, the seamstress is already half way through pressing it, your daughter will not be trying this dress on.

Daughter: Mom, let it go, I have enough dresses to try.

Mom huffs off to look for even more gowns, and my coworker and I exchange wide eye glances. THEN, while her daughter is in the middle of trying dresses, she goes back there again and says ""Well look at this one dear, this dress has this and this and this and that dress doesn't. I still think you should try this on."" At this point, I get a little rude.

""Ma'am, I apologize, but you cannot go to the backroom and interfere with the seamstress while she is working. Your daughter will not be trying that dress on, and that is final.""

She again huffs off back to her seat, and sits there until they leave, at which point my coworker and I burst out laughing at that ridiculous woman.

I know it's not even remotely as bad as what some of you guys get, but like come on lady, use common sense.

RedHeadedBug,66,,378,1l698q,,1615,"This happened a while ago but has really stuck with me and I like to think about it on really bad days at work.

I had been working all day in the aquatics department of my store dealing with all manner of rude, condescending customers when this little boy, maybe 6 or 7 years old, and a woman whom I had assumed was his mother came in.

They were looking to buy some fish for the tank that the little boy had gotten for his birthday. He came right on up to me, grabbed my hand and asked me very politely if I could find him some fish that ""would be happy to come live with me"". My heart just about melted. 

I told him that I most certainly could and asked him if he could ask his mom, who was a little ways off looking at the betta fish, what size his tank was so we could get started. He replied, ""She isn't my mommy, she is my all pears!""

The woman over heard this and saw my obviously confused face and explained that she was his nanny and that his parents called her an ""Au Pair"" once and he had liked the way it sounded but apparently couldn't pronounce it correctly. 

I helped them find some fish for his 20 gallon tank (some mollies and a couple of swordtails) and when I had finished bagging them up and handed them off to the ""all pears"" the little boy gave a little tug on my apron and thanked me for helping them. He also asked if he could give me a hug and take a picture with me and his new fish. So I knelt down to his level and let him throw an arm around me while his other hand held the bag of fish and the nanny took our picture.  It was just the sweetest thing I have ever had happen to me at work.

The nanny came in about a week later when I was working to get more food for the fish and told me that the little boy had asked her to print the picture out and that now it sits on his desk right next to his tank where the fish can ""see"" it so that they ""don't miss their old house and their old friends"".

It makes me smile ever time I think about that little boy and his nanny even though I haven't seen them since that last time the nanny came in. He was so sweet and polite and just really made my day that day. ","The little boy and his ""All Pears""",1993,talesFromRetail
pompous512,211,,447,1p6euj,,1605,"Closer to the end of my shift today, a family came into the store. It was a mom, dad, and two daughters, probably around 8 and 6. They browsed for a bit, and every once in a while I would listen in. The mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer. 

When they picked out the items they wanted to buy (two Disney Infinity characters and a game) and my coworker told them their total, the mom turned to the oldest daughter.

""You're paying for these with your birthday money. Do you remember how much money you have?"" When the daughter shook her head, the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter, letting the daughter add up the 20 dollar bills. When the girl had decided she had $80, my coworker reminded her that she owed $65. The mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys. The daughter replied yes really hesitantly, and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer. So the daughter handed the money to my coworker, who rang up the transaction, gave her the change and helped her count it out. 

The daughter thanked us and began to leave, carrying the bag, but the mom stayed behind to thank us. She was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value, and at other places, cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enough.

I was working the Saturday night drive-thru shift at a popular fast food place. It was maybe 10 PM. We were pretty busy, typical Saturday night crowd - soccer moms in their minivans, stoners with their loud bass music playing, and nurses from a nearby hospital on their way to the night shift.  
  
A Camaro pulled up to order. The driver, a typical spoiled college kid, began his order with ""sup,"" and ended every other sentence with ""bro."" While I was inputting his order, he exchanged raunchy jokes with the guy in the passenger's seat. They ordered 2 large size combo meals... and an order of chicken nuggets.  
  
When the car pulled up to the window, both of the bros had their shirts off. They looked fairly sweaty, despite the fact that it was barely 80 degrees (27 Celsius for any non-Americans.) They both had the expression that said ""yeah, we're the shit."" I couldn't tell what they were so proud of... until I looked in the back seat.  
  
The back seat of the car contained the ugliest crack whore I have ever seen. Her skin looked like something from The Thing, and her nails were several inches long. Her boobs drooped like wilted, rotten petunias. She was wearing platform heels... and nothing else. I couldn't tell for sure, but I think her hair was a wig too.  
  
When I handed the bros their food, she stuck her abominable head into the front seat and screeched at me in a voice like a million nails on a chalkboard: ""CAN I HAVE SOME KETCHUP?"" I shoved a handful of ketchup packets into the bag and shuddered. The bros handed her the box of chicken nuggets, cranked up their shitty rap music, and peeled out.

kayelletee,245,,571,1hi3eh,,1573,"Ninja Edit: Sorry for the wall of text. I'm a wordy person and feel this story is best in all its glory.

I work alone at a dry cleaner/laundromat. This lady comes in and hands me her tickets to pick up her dry cleaning. She had more than the average bear's worth of dry cleaning spread out over a few tickets. I add up her total twice and check to make sure it matches her receipt.

""Okay, your total is $82."" She looks at me flabbergasted for a second.

""No it's not. The guy told me that it was $72."" 

""I'll double check the math."" I added everything up again and said, ""No, I'm sorry. This is $82, see?"" 

""No you're wrong! Why would he tell me that it was $72?! He must have been giving me a discount."" 

""He might have misspoke, or miscalculated, but he wrote right here on your ticket $82.""

""Well you need to get him on the phone then, I need to talk to your manager.""

""I'm sorry, that man is not the manager. My manager doesn't actually work at the store. I'm in charge for the day.""

""Well I'm going to need his number."" She was huffing and puffing at this point and I was also getting shakey. My boss had given me a no nonsense policy and tells me to ask customers to leave and not come back when they get indignant. She also doesn't want me calling her for any reason. (She's not a very good manager.)

""I'm sorry, to be honest with you I don't know the other employee's number, and I can't give you my manager's cell phone number.""

""WELL THEN CALL HER! Get her on the phone right now.""

""I'm sorry, I can't call her in the middle of the day. She's at work right now. I'm the manager right now."" (This argument repeats until she gets the picture.)

""I'm not paying anymore than what that man told me. $70 is all you can have!""

""That's fine if you just want to pick up a few things. We can hold on the the rest until you can pay for them.""

""Are you fucking kidding me?! You're going to be stealing my clothes from me?! I can take them if I want to!""

""Well, we've already provided you a service, I'm not going to give them back until you pay for them."" (Protip, using big words like this piss people off. In retrospect I was being condescending.)

At this point she goes over to her clothes and starts tearing them out of the bags. She's throwing the bags all over the floor, huffing and mumbling and tearing her clothes off the hangers.
""These look like shit! I'm not paying for these!""

""I'm sorry, I'd be happy to redo them for you. It would be ready to pick up in two days.""

""Fuck! I NEED them this weekend. No you can't redo them. But I'm not paying full price!'

""I'm sorry, the total is still $82."" (I was not giving in)

""Who THE FUCK do you think you are?!"" she screamed. 

I then make the worst mistake of my life, I chuckle. Not to be condescending, but because I am really uncomfortable. I mean really uncomfortable, even after five years in retail I am in awe every time some yells at me like this. I am a humanist and am still constantly in shock that people can be so aggressive and hateful. I'm naive, whatever. Anyway, I chuckle a nervous is-lady-going-to-kill-me laugh. She loses it.

""THIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE. I'M NOT FUCKING PLAYING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. MY HUSBAND IS GOING TO KILL ME WHEN I GET HOME IF I SPEND $80 FUCKING DOLLARS ON THESE CLOTHES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? HE'S ALREADY PISSED OFF WITH ME, AND HE'S PISSED OFF WITH YOU FOR TAKING SO FUCKING LONG TO GET HIS CLOTHES DONE. YOU DO NOT WANT HIM TO COME HERE. I DO NOT WANT TO BOTHER HIM WITH THIS SHIT. HE'S ALREADY PISSED OFF WITH ME!"" which makes me more uncomfortable thinking her husband probably beats her.

""Ma'am, please stop cursing at me. There are kids in here."" There were.  

""I'M NOT CURSING AT YOU. IF I WAS CUSSIN' AT YOU I'D BE CALL YOU A SKANKY FAT-ASS BITCH CUNT FUCKING HEIFER. I'M NOT CALLING YOU ANY OF THOSE THINGS AM I?"" Alright, I've hit my limit. 

""I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

""YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I'M GOING TO CALL 911.""

""...um okay?"" I was really confused. She took out her cell phone and called 911. 

""Hello, I'm at [This] dry cleaner and I'm having a domestic dispute. We need an officer right away. Yes, thank you.""

I look around for a bit trying to wrap my brain around what's happening and said, 'Okay. Well I'm going to get some work done while we wait for the police."" I picked up all the trash and hangers she threw all over the floor. In retrospect, I should have left them as evidence she was being crazy. I guess she might have said I threw it at her. The police station is right up the road so it wasn't a long wait. Oh, she called in late for work while she watched me pick up her mess. 

The officer came in and he was super polite and calm. She recounted her story which was mostly true, if a little biased. Me not giving her a discount, me not calling the manager. She also added that I owed her for the money she was missing by not being at work in time. She did say that I told her she had to leave after she called 911 because I was trying to hide the evidence. (lolwhut.) I then said that wasn't true, that she called the police after I asked her to leave. The officer looked a little confused and asked me what happened. 

He turned back to the lady and said ""Okay. What can Thiscity Police Department do for you today?""

She said, ""Well officer, if I'm not happy with the service I need a discount.""

He turned to the lady and said ""You know, I don't want to discourage you from calling 911 when you need to. You should call if you're in danger. Or in the case of criminal activity- but this is a dispute that the police department can't settle for you. Why don't you come back on another day to pick up your clothes.""

""Yes sir officer, that's a good idea."" 

""I agree,' he said. ""I'm going to need you to step outside with me so that I can get your information. Just in case you need me again.""

And she left. He took her info outside and she got in her car and (presumably) drove to work. She came back the next day and payed $82 for her dry cleaning. I felt really bad for her.

Fat_Head,297,,495,1h5yw0,,1568,"So I was working at a popular video game store a couple years back when Fifa 10 was just being released. It was a high volume store, so we got plenty of copies. This also meant we had a huge amount of preorders.

People would often preorder the game specifically to get the included collector's items, and we had one customer (we'll call him Fred) that called up the day before and preordered the collector's edition for his son's 10th birthday. It was one of the last ones we had in stock, so he was lucky to snag it in time.

Fast forward to release day, and it was crazy busy. For the first time since I'd worked there, we actually sold every one of our preorders on release day, as well as all of our regular stock.

Except for one - Fred's copy.

So the day chugged along busily and as it drew to a close, we only had one copy left, which was reserved for Fred. I was constantly turning people down for sales of the game, or signing them up for a copy when a new shipment arrived.

I then left the register to do some inventory for 10 minutes before returning. In just 10 minutes, my genius colleague managed to sell Fred's copy of Fifa 10.

I didn't know this had happened, so about 20 minutes after I'd returned to the register, Fred and his wife walks in and asks to pick up his son's copy of the game. I do a search for the game, and our stock says a big fat ZERO. This includes reserved stock.

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, we just sold the last copy. There must have been a mixup and your reserved copy was sold to another customer.""

Fred: ""What? But I reserved it! It's for my son's 18th birthday tonight!""

Me: ""I apologize, it's entirely our fault. We don't have any copies to sell you today, but I can put you on a waiting list for the next shipment that comes to the store if you'd like?""

It's at this point I notice Fred's wife is crying. I notice that Fred is visibly trying to control his anger, but his face is going red and I can see that the situation is not getting any better.

Fred: ""My son's birthday is tonight and I promised him we'd play the new Fifa tonight! What am I going to do? THIS IS UNFAIR!""

I feel very sorry for these people, and I realize that this is a very unfair situation for them, so I improvise.

Me: ""I'm really sorry sir. Let me do a quick search for other stores in the area that have stock, and here's a $25 off voucher for the game. I hope that makes up for our mistake.""

As I was talking, I found a store about 10 minutes away that had stock of the game. As I handed the voucher to Fred, his entire composure changed completely. He was dumbfounded, and a massive smiled exploded onto his face.

Fred: ""Oh... wow, thank you so much! I'll go there right now and pick the game up. Thank you! I'll definitely come back to this store from now on!"" And his wife thanked me profusely as well. I felt great. I'd made a family's day, kept a customer happy and probably saved the store a lot of bad word-of-mouth. Those are the moments that make retail worthwhile.

As I was closing up that night, the store manager came up and started talking to me.

Store manager: ""fat_head, I saw what you did with those customers today. You do realise that's a serious breach of store policy? That's $25 off the other store's margin. Those vouchers are supposed to be for the &lt;other game&gt; promotion only. I'm going to speak to the Area Manager about this, and I never want to see you do that again without my permission.""

I was speechless. I could not believe a manager could be so money-hungry that he'd prefer to absolutely piss a customer off because of my colleague's mistake, over giving them a voucher and making them happy as anything. I was furious that night, because even though it was (apparently) against store policy, I didn't deserve to be told off.

Next day, I come in for my shift, and the Area Manager is talking to the store manager. I get pulled into the back room.

Area Manager: ""fat_head, Store Manager has filled me in on what you did yesterday with the $25 coupon. Unfortunately that is a serious breach of store policy, and we're going to have to terminate your employment. Please give me your store key and leave immediately.""

I was actually not really that surprised. I was only a casual and so they could fire me on a whim, and the area manager was equally as penny-pinching as the store manager.

Me: ""You know what, don't bother firing me, I don't want to work here if you're going to treat me like this. I tried my best to keep the customer happy, but hey, don't let me stop you from pissing off the people who pay your wage! Did Store Manager tell you it was &lt;employee&gt;'s fault their RESERVED game was sold to someone else? I guess that's perfect grounds for firing the employee that fixed the situation! Now there's some good management!""

Then I dropped my store key on the ground and walked out without another word. Maybe that was a bit too rude, but I just couldn't believe that they'd value $25 over customer service. Just another example of managers power tripping and penny-pinching without caring for the people they are there to service. Oh well, I'm glad they fired me. It was a terrible place to work.

FredFltStn,159,,814,1nwr0r,,1558,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

I've posted a few other stories [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/) if you're interested.

**STORY:**  I think because of the type of business I have, a fireworks tent in a parking lot, that people who come to shop just assume that they can wheel and deal to get a better price. They're right! I own the place, I set the prices, and I get to make the rules. 

We always try to throw in something extra for our customers. Where I'm from in Louisiana, it's known as “lagniappe”, which means “a little something extra”. It's kind of like a Baker's dozen (13 instead of 12). If you come in with a great attitude, pick out your stuff, and are friendly to my staff, I'm going to make sure you leave happy. 

I love the customers that come in and try to get a deal by telling us that they “know the owner”. You would not believe how often this happens. My standard response when someone tells me this is...

**THEM:**  I’m supposed to get a discount. I know the owner.

**ME:**  Great! If you can just have him give me a call, we can go ahead and give you the standard 50% discount.

If we’re slow, my other favorite scenario is to tell them that we’ll check the “comp list” to see if they’re supposed to get their stuff for free. I’ll then periodically yell out and randomly ask each employee if they’ve seen the comp list, while obviously making no attempt to look myself. Most of my employees are in on the joke, and will just say no, or claim they saw some other employee looking at it.

The credit for the best response goes to my good friend Steven, who kindly takes a few days off from his real job to help me out when I’m really busy. When he’s helping, I think of him as another manager. I trust his judgment, and if he wants to give a discount or step in and take care of an issue, more power to him.

Steven had been helping out a problem shopper, and the guy had really worn him out. I’d been helping out other people, but I’d seen Steven going round and round with this guy. Typical entitled angry shopper (EAS). Steven is showing him around and explaining what everything does. Meanwhile, the guy is basically berating Steven the entire time. He doesn’t like the stuff we have, our prices are too expensive, he can get a better deal down the road, it goes on and on. 

The guy finally gets up to the counter to check out, and Steven goes off to help someone else. After a few minutes, the cashier calls Steven back to the counter. Steven had already given the guy a couple of free things to try and make him happy, but the EAS is now demanding a discount on his entire purchase. I’m standing about 15 feet away helping another customer, when I stop and look over just in time to catch this exchange.

**EAS:**  I’m supposed to get a discount. I know the owner!

**STEVEN:**  You do?!? You must be the guy he called me about. 

**EAS:**  YES.

**STEVEN:**  He said that you were an asshole, and that I should charge you double for whatever you wanted.

Steven turned around and walked away, EAS angrily paid and stormed out of the tent, and I turned and went right back to helping my customer, who was now laughing her ass off.

&gt;**BONUS RESPONSES FROM MY SINGLE DAYS:**
&gt;
&gt;A selection of some of my responses when it was a beautiful woman claiming they knew the owner to get a discount.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;**ME:**  Hello, I'm the owner. Would you like to discuss your discount over coffee?
&gt;
&gt;**ME:**  The owner told me we were only allowed to give discounts if the woman was topless.

**STORY:**  We offer an unconditional no dud guarantee on everything we sell. Basically, if it doesn't work, bring it back and we'll replace it or give you your money back. We occasionally have items returned, but it doesn't happen very often.

The morning after NYE, one of our regulars showed up for a return. He was moving pretty slow and was nursing an obvious hangover. He wanted to return our 16,000 firecracker roll because it was a dud. He was pretty bummed, since this was supposed to be the big midnight finale at his friends house. 

I was immediately confused, since I have no idea how 16,000 firecrackers could have all been bad. I told him we would take care of it and asked him if it had gotten wet. He told me that it just wouldn’t light, no matter how hard they tried, and it was in the back of his car if we wanted to check it out.

Now this particular roll is packaged to look like a giant firecracker, with a piece of rope coming out of the top to simulate a fuse, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/nLJIdTa.jpg). At the base of the rope are pictures and written directions explaining how to unwrap the package to get to the real fuse. You can then roll it out, so the firecrackers go off individually, or light it as a bundle, with all 16,000 firecrackers going off in about a minute. 

To prove his point, he pulled out his phone to show my dad and I a video they had taken of him trying to light it. In the video, he was obviously **LOADED**, and was stumbling around with a lighter trying to light **THE PIECE OF GREEN ROPE**! I could hear people laughing in the background and egging him on, as they had filmed him trying to drunkenly light a piece of rope for 5 minutes. As we’re watching the video, I’m dying inside, and trying to think of a nice way to tell him what his mistake was. Suddenly, he paused the video, slowly looked up at us and said,

**CUST:**  That’s not really the fuse is it.

**ME:**  (Starting to chuckle) Nope.

**CUST:**  Those Bastards!

**ME:**  (Dying laughing now) Look, I’ll give you your money back AND give you another one for free if you’ll send me that video.

I think he considered it for a second, but then he figured out that I was DEFINITELY going to post the video on my website. Hell, I’d have given him triple his money back for a copy of that video. He quickly hit the delete button and shook his head no. I tried to give him his money back, but he wouldn’t accept it. He asked us to check out the firecracker roll in his car to make sure it was still good, and my dad walked out to check on it with him.

My dad was laughing when he walked back into the tent, and let me in on the joke. After my dad had peeled back the paper and showed the guy where the real fuse was, the guy thanked my dad and casually mentioned his plans. He was now on his way to buy a big metal garbage can, and then planned to stop by his friend’s house to say good morning.","If you're going to be an idiot, don't let them get it on video [Tales from a Fireworks Tent].",2160,talesFromRetail
CurvedStraightLine,79,,391,1l4bv8,,1523,"Quick story I just told a friend and figured I'd commit to the ages here.

After I left the store I have spoken at length about, I was working for a chain of craft supply stores.  I was hired on as a manager, but they didn't actually have a store to put me in.  So I was serving as acting store manager in multiple locations.  Basically if you were the store manager and went on vacation/were in the hospital or if a manager had been fired or quit and they were moving in the new store manager, they would just have me fill in at the store until things settled.

I did this for eight months, travelling over eight states living out of hotel rooms (which wasn't actually what I signed on for, but that's another story)

So I am in New York, covering a store, and in walks a guy with a return.  All returns in this company were handled by a manager and we had final discretion.

In this case, the guy was obviously pulling some scam.  The product was used, and had old packaging, but he had a new receipt.  Plus, he had an out of state license.  He claimed that he was on vacation, but who takes along a receipt to make a return from two months ago while on vacation?

He huffed and puffed when I told him no, and threatened to go to another location.

That night I got a call from my DM.  A manager had been fired and they were relocating me NOW.  I drove overnight to Virginia, (edit realizing that not everyone knows distance here.  I drove for 9 hours that night, non stop save for bathroom breaks.  It's REALLY far away). I met my DM at the store to get the keys and story, and stuck around a little while before crashing at the hotel.

Halfway through the day I get paged that a customer has a return.  I come up and its the same guy.  I let him talk about his return, show me his receipt, then I smile and say ""Just like I told you in New York, you can't do this return.""

He stared at me for a moment.  I'm a redhead, so he slowly recognized me, eyes going wide and he backed away.  He glanced over at the doorway I had come from, confused.  Then he just left, leaving his receipt behind.

The other store wasn't his ""local"" store where the receipt was from either (although closer to home) so he had just apparently tried to pull the same scam elsewhere only to meet OmniManager.

hostile__17,191,,261,198a3j,,1488,"I've been working in a grocery/clothing/general merchandise retailer for about four years.  Mostly I work up at the customer service desk, which entails printing up money orders, processing wire transfers, selling all the tobacco products, cashing out lottery, and primarily, returns and exchanges.  

A year or so ago, during a slower part of the day, a man (probably in his mid-late 50's) comes up to me at the desk with an xbox 360 to return.  He said that he bought it a couple weeks prior (which was true, as he had his receipt still and I checked the date) for his son who decided that he wanted a PS3 instead.  He said that they already purchased a PS3 somewhere else, and he just needed to return the xbox.

Unfortunately, even with a receipt, gaming consoles (in addition to all computer software and hardware, CDs, DVDs, video games, etc) are non-refundable once they've been opened.  I've always thought that this policy was completely reasonable, especially since my store only deals in brand new products, not used.  And we can't ship it back to the manufacturer unless there is some kind of manufacturer's defect, which in this case, there was not.

I calmly explained to him that once a console has been opened, we can do nothing but exchange it for an identical product (and that's only in the case of a defect).  He scowls at me and demands a manager.  

Fine, AWESOME.  I can see where this is going, and I don't get paid enough to deal with the brewing storm of attitude.  So I call up the electronics manager, and he comes over to talk to the customer.

The customer explains that he doesn't want the xbox anymore, and wants his money back.  In return, the electronics manager disclosed our return policy basically verbatim for what I said. He demands a different manager, this time much, MUCH louder.  Wow, okay.  So I give *my* direct manager a call and ask her to come over.  She comes over, gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back, and how we're stealing from him by not giving him a refund.  She asks the electronics manager (who is still standing up here) what our policy is, he informs her, she looks at the customer and says something like, ""sorry, this is our policy.  If there's anything else we can do for you, please just ask hostile __17.""

The man explodes.  Yelling and screaming about how he doesn't want this fucking thing, and it's ours and we have to take it back.  There was some more screaming about how we're dirty thieves and we're stealing money from him, and how it's illegal.  Lots of yelling.

I called the store director.  The boss's boss's boss.  HE gets paid enough to deal with this bullshit.

The director (who is actually a completely rational cool dude) comes up and (after patiently listening to this guy's ranting for about 10 minutes) gives him the same answer that he's gotten from the rest of us. (Don't you love it when your managers back you up after you've said no to an asshole customer?) 

This is the last straw for unhappy customer guy.  He claims that if we aren't going to do something for him, he's calling the police to arrest us all for theft. Yep. Theft. I'm stoked to see if he does, and apparently the managers are too, so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants to.

Dude picks up his cellphone, calls his lawyer (or at least claims to), and leaves a message detailing the situation.  Apparently his lawyer didn't have time in the middle of a work day to answer a call from one of her clients.  

He makes a second call to the 6 o'clock news.  He wants EVERYONE to know how shitty [undisclosed retailer] treats their customers, and screams at us about how we'll all be out of jobs and that no one will ever shop here again!  It's a nationwide chain, bro.  I'm pretty sure we're going to be fine, but thanks.

He makes a final call to the police.  They were the only ones to answer the fucking phone.  Hah.  He says that the customer service bitch from [retailer] has stolen hundreds of dollars from him, and is being backed up by all her dumbass managers.  He's screaming at the cops over the phone (I'm almost surprised that the police didn't hang up on him, but, I mean, they *are* the cops.  I don't think they can legally hang up on anyone who's dialed 911).

It takes the cops about 30 minutes to show up, during which time my managers have gone back to their jobs, and I'm filing away some paperwork, and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk (having some kind of sit it or something).  Every time another customer starts heading my way, he yells and screams at them, ""don't shop here!!  They steal your money!  Bunch of fucking thieves!!!""  I'm fine with this.  It's hilarious, he looks like a bridge troll and I have paperwork to catch up on.

Eventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face.  It won't last.

He declares to the nice officers that I took his money and refused to give it back, which obviously puzzles them, as I'm a fucking employee and covered by like five cameras at all times.  I clarify that I didn't take *anything* from him.  He bought an xbox a couple weeks back, opened it up and played it, then wanted to return it.  I also explained our return policy to them.  I showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk, by the desk that the xbox was purched at, on our website, and on HIS receipt.  I can tell that the poor cops are just dreading dealing with this guy, but they give him an ultimatum.

He can either:

*Not get a refund from us and go home.

*Not get a refund and go to jail.

Angry customer: ""I'D RATHER GO TO JAIL THEN LET THESE FUCKERS WIN!  I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY MONEY!!!!!""

I don't think he was getting it.  So the cops handcuff him and start heading towards the door, when I realize that his xbox is still sitting on the counter.  I grab it and run after them.

Me: ""Wait, sir!  You left your merchendise at the counter.""

One of the cops takes it from me.

Me: ""Have a wonderful day, sir!  Thank you for shopping at [retailer]!""

I'm pretty sure he would have strangled me if he hadn't been handcuffed. Haha.

professor_dog,183,,407,1csvb6,,1484,"So, I was talking to a co worker, and found out that we both used to frequent the same 24 hour diner. He shared this story with me, and I thought I'd share with you.

So my friend and his friends went to this diner, and were sat next to a very large woman, (probably about  five foot nothing, and around 300 pounds) and her very skinny boyfriend. Also, shes really drunk. So Big Fat Drunk Lady (bfdl) demands that her boyfriend give her a dollar, she wants to play the claw machine.

She walks over to the claw machine and drops the dollar. When she bends over to pick it up, her too small sweat shorts dissapear into her butt. My. friend described it as ""the largest, grossest, most pock marked and cellulite ridden cottage cheese ass you have ever seen."" So, that is pretty gross.

After trying and failing the claw machine, BFDL disappears around the corner for a few minutes. She comes back just as her food gets to the table, but along with the waitress, two cops walked up to the table.

The cops say ""ma'am, some of the other patrons said that they saw you take four dollars from a table that they left as a tip"".

BFDL immediately starts yelling and cursing at the officers 

""OH HELL NO! THATS BULLSHIT!"" She pulls some neatly folded twenties in a money clip from one pocket as shes screaming. She pulls from the other pocket, four crinkled ones. 

""THIS HEAR IS MY MONEY, I FOUND IT"" , she yells as shes trying to smooth out the money. Then she realizes what she said and changes her story ""NO, I BROUGHT THESE FROM HOME! THIS IS MY MONEY!""

Finally the officers have had enough, and they say that shes going to have to come with them. BFDL screams no, picks up her plate of food and smashes it against the wall. At this point she goes under the table and comes back up eating a piece of food that hit the floor. The officers lead her out in cuffs at this point, as shes screaming and spraying food chunks everywhere.

The super skinny boyfriend who has not said a single word at this point, looks at his food, lets out a long deep sigh and says ""Man. She has the keys""

GNPunk,123,,408,1imzyt,,1478,"Working in big box retail has yielded me some amazing stories.  Some involve unruly customers, most involve Black Friday, and a few result in some hilarious attempts to steal shit in the store.

You've all been in big box stores, so I'll describe this one's layout.  (Remember = Don't guess!  Youbanistan is not a fun place to visit...they don't have cookies or milk at all!)

The layout at the time was that your PCs, Televisions, Appliances, and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor.  We had a white and black walkway that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center.  Inside the center were cameras, cell phones, and most importantly, shelves upon shelves of CDs, DVDs, video games, etc.

Middle of the week in this store was boring as hell.  Most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the mullets that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as ""Code M"" which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department.  Our LP guy was a good friend of mine, and at 6'7"" with a hilarious sense of humor, the store tended to be more fun when he was watching the cameras up front.

On this day, however, we got our entertainment from a short woman who decided she was going to try and rob us blind.

It was a little cool outside, but nothing overbearing as it was early Spring.  This woman, however, had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants, a winter jacket, sunglasses (kept them on indoors), and a heavy sweater underneath.  It wasn't a minute before she was in the DVDs and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy.  My friend at LP, we'll call him Alex, hits me up on the earpiece.

**Alex:  Hey man, can you wander over by this woman in DVDs and see what the hell she is doing?**

**Me:  Yeah...why?  Is she acting strange?**

**Alex:  Oh yeah.  She did a triple take at one of the cameras I have locked on to her.**

**Me:  Wow.  Why is she bundled up like it's 20 below outside?**

**Alex:  That's why I want you to watch her.**

I set up camp about three aisles diagonally from her and actually had a good view.  Sure enough, this woman grabs a bunch of the cheap DVDs that weren't in security cases, looks around, and stuffs them down her pants.

**Me:  You catch that on camera?**

**Alex:  Yep, already calling the police now.  Just keep locked onto her.**

She wasn't content there.  She made a few stops along the way, stopping at the Xbox 360 section, the Blu-Rays, and the PS3 games.  Hey, at least she wasn't a fanboy of one system or the other!  Thieves apparently don't discriminate!

She spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing.  At this point, there are four of us basically watching her from a distance while we wait for the police, who showed up in the form of two cruisers outside.  One was set up in the parking lot, the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance.  Alex went out to greet him, where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up.

**Alex:  Why are you stretching, sir?**

**Officer:  I hope she runs.  I need a workout!**

Meanwhile, back in the store, our little thief had caught on to the fact that she was being watched the entire time and was putting the cheap DVDs back in a different spot than the belonged.  Once she did that, even though she still had plenty of other things, she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit ""I PUT EVERYTHING BACK DON'T YOU ALL DARE TOUCH ME YOU FUCKING PRICKS!""

Oye.  Some people just don't get it, do they?

Of course, the alarm goes off when she hits the exit and bolts right past Alex as he's coming back into the building.  Now, store rules for us meant that once she was outside the store, we couldn't chase her.  However, Officer Workout was ready and, sure as shit, she took off the moment she saw the cruiser.  We would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a Division Three college nearby, which wasn't a shock as he performed a beautiful form-fitting tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot.  You know the type I'm talking about:  Getting her from behind, lifting her completely off her feet, but making sure that he set her back down on the feet like you would in football warmups when practicing tackling form.

No injuries, no blood, just getting the thief.

The best line of the day, though, came from the officer after he brought her back in for us to show her the security tape and to fill out our official paperwork on her.  He heads out of the office and comes over to us, giving us his direct phone number.

**Officer:  Seriously, guys, just call me next time and not dispatch.  I love this shit.**

sorellina,88,,319,1dnyww,,1469,"An 8 yo girl came into my bookstore today and asked me where the Megan McDonald books were so she could get her Judy Moody on, and we got to talking about school. 

She said one of her classes is learning how to speak Chinese. Impressed, I asked if she could count to ten and she looked at me like ""don't be ridiculous everyone can count to ten in Mandarin"" and then expertly rattled off the numbers. I asked her how to say a few more words, and she knew each one. It was impressive to say the least. Her dad was off to the side, lit up like a lamp and obviously incredibly proud of his awesome daughter.

Laurelann,102,,410,1edvjt,,1452,"First time post, so be gentle. Also, I am not entirely sure that this belongs here, but I thought this was the most interesting phone call at my last job.

Setup: I live in a small city I  the midwest, and I worked for a company that served adults with disabilities in a group home setting. I am working at the main house, the first house the owner opened and also the location of the office. The number to the house also functioned as the main line to the business.  I would answer the phone when working since I would never have any idea if a manager or the owner was downstairs working, and they did not like to get interrupted anyway. 

So I am working one afternoon,  and this guy calls in and says something like: ""You have someone working for you who is on drugs and I thought you would like to know this.""

Since the company is so small, I have met every single employee. 

So I bite. Me: ""who are you talking about?""

He names an employee that we don't have! I'm a bit at a loss, so I tell him thanks for calling, but we don't actually have that person as an employee. 

He insists that she is working there, says her name repeatedly, and very slowly, as if that will help.

 I again, tell him this person is absolutely not an employee, and add that I have personally met each employee, and have never heard of this woman. I remember there is another organization in town that works with individuals with disabilities.  The first two words of my company's name is the same as their's, and the third word is similar.  I suggest to him that he has confused our companies, and he should call them.

Him: ""YOU DON'T CARE IF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE ON DRUGS!!""

Me: ""Sir, we would care if that was our employee, but since that person doesn't work here, it really doesn't concern us."" I am staring to get a bit frustrated. 

Him: ""I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR. NOW!""

Me: ""They are very busy and don't have time for this. This person is not our employee, so I am not going to bother them with this.

Him: WHERE IS YOUR OFFICE?  I WILL COME DOWN THERE AND TELL THEM MYSELF.

Since the office is actually a group home as well, I really don't want this guy coming here. Besides,  the address to the company is listed along with the phone number. So I lie.

Me: The location is confidential, I'm sorry I can't tell you.

The guy really loses it, starts screaming about how he knows that we have that druggie person employed,  and how he is going to come straight down to the office, which he can now apparently find,  and tell to my supervisors everything, and get both myself and this other person fired. 

I tell him that I will see him soon then and hang up. No one ever shows up.

Fast Forward a six years and this other company in town with the similar name has now hired me. I am chatting with my supervisor about my new company, and how they seem to be very accommodating and understanding.  She agrees and mentions that she dated a guy who turned out to be very unstable and he came into the office screaming about how she was on drugs and made up other lies to get her fired, etc; and the boss saw through that. How they had to have his picture posted at reception and they called the police if he showed up.

Yesterday I was on my half, sitting in the back, munching on some Almond Joy Pieces and playing games on my phone. I had 5 minutes left of my break and I hear our sensor go off. Now, our sensor is pretty close to some of our merchandise, and it's not uncommon for people carrying items around the store to set it off, or an employee outstocking to set it off. But I heard it and I just **knew**. Someone was stealing and my boss was going to have a field day. 

As she told it to me, some kid and his mom were in the store looking around and decided to leave. The set the sensor off and the guy (mid to late teens) kept walking. Mom stops.

Sauronsvisine,135,,620,1khlyu,,1447,"Just after I graduated highschool, I worked as a page for the local library. I know that pushes the ragged edge of retail, but we had customers, and really, what is a library but a book store that doesn't understand economics?

*****

We had some regulars in the library. Some were kids from the highschool across the street whose parents used as a substitute daycare, and others were grown-ass men who spent their entire days in a public library. It takes all kinds. This is a story about Mr. Meerkat, the worst of our regulars.

Every day - from open to close - Mr. Meerkat would be there. He had a study booth that he always took. One in the back where nobody could see him. He earned his distinctive name from the fact that he would stand up every couple of minutes to see if anyone was approaching him. Now, I have no place judging strange people. It happens. of the 7 billion people on the planet, there are gonna be some anomalies. 

Mr. Meerkat had a bigger problem though. He hid things. We didn't have any cameras, so we were never able to prove it because everyone knew. He had a big problem with President Obama (fair enough) and the American left in general (also fair enough). But we would see him with say, *Dreams From My Father*, and a month later we would find it stuffed in a corner under a stack of magazines.  He'd also remove the New Yorker, and hide the %local_gay_newspaper%. This has been going on for years. He's just clever enough, and county government employees are just apathetic enough, that nothing has been done about it.

Enter The All Seeing Eye. I was working two jobs at the time, the library and an internship at a local tech company. I was doing 12 hour days every day at the tech place, and days I worked at the library were generally 15 - 16 hours. After two months of this I was an exhausted angry mess. I spot him sitting away from his usual space holding a copy of freakonomics. Not reading, just sitting, watching me. I know what's coming, and duck behind and aisle to watch him. Fool thinks I can't see him. He jams the book between the stuffed chair he was in and the wall and walks off.

For the few weeks there were no issues. I was a computer nerd already, so learning the register and procedures was a cinch. I only worked 12 hours per week still being in highschool.

My manager was a 25 year-old bitch, at this point. She'd been thin and pretty but not-so-bright when she started working there and had gained quite a bit of weight due to her free manager meals of complete grease. She hated that I packed a lunch from home instead of eating the slop we served.  Topping it off, I'd caught on to things way quicker than she had and people talked about it and it caused her to hate me.

In my third week I'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in... a very large couple. 350lb+ each. The man wheezes up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes. I'm thinking this is a big order, but their big people, and I don't know how many people they're going to be feeding anyway.

I ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells: ""I'm eating too!"" ... wut? She orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies. Seriously. She then follows that up with ""And I need a large diet Coke."" at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet Coke as well.

I'm laughing internally at this point, but it is a to-go order and they probably have a few kids or another family coming over... something. Right? It has to be.

Their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food... to the dine-in tables.

Me: I'm sorry folks, I thought you'd ordered that for take-out, I could get you some trays if you'd like.""

Man: Don't need trays. We always order take-out because I'm not paying tax to eat here!

Cheap fucks. They just spent nearly $40 on food but can't pay the tax? Eh. Whatever. I go about my day and start cleaning the lobby. I'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up. I figured something must be wrong so I look to see and.... the food's all gone. In roughly 7 minutes. Nearly 17,000 calories of extra krispy, wings, and potatoes.

Stunned silence. I'm staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out.

Woman notices me staring and and gets pissed. Calls for manager. Manager comes up and listens to how badly I treated them by acting like she wouldn't be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy (wut?) meal.

She told me in front of the customers that I had two choices. 1. Apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or 2. Termination. Fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself.

I laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry slob like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a blessing. Took my apron off and put it on the counter, clocked out and headed for the door. The whole time the fatties are bitching at me and manager both: ""Come back here! Are you going to let him...!"" and manager is trying to calm them down and yell at me: ""Come back here! You can't do..."" and it's all just background noise, because it suddenly feels like all weight and stress has been removed from my shoulders.

SkittishFox,60,,448,1gv1ym,,1394,"Sorry for posting again so soon but I couldn't get this one out of my head so I feel obligated to share it.

This incident takes place during my summer position at a gas station. All employees wore headsets so we wouldn't have to yell from across the store.

From the moment this guy walked in I could tell he was having a bad day. He impatiently waits in line. When he makes it to the counter, he starts speaking and suddenly there came a fairly loud conversation taking place over the headsets. Taking the earpiece out, I apologize.

""I'm sorry sir, what was that?"" Apparently that meant I was deaf and stupid.

""Coolant! C-O-O-L-A-N-T, where is it!?""

""Oh, I'm sorry, it's right down this first aisle here on the bottom shelf."" 

He storms off and picks one up, brings it up and drops it on the counter. I quietly ring it up and tell him his total. He opened his wallet and a very audible ""Fuck!"" radiated through the store. 
""I hope I have enough in my damn bank account."" He swipes his card, it goes through. He snatches the coolant and heads out to his car. 

It was only then I noticed the hood was propped up and a twenty something girl was sitting in the passenger seat, crying. I keep my attention on the guy, as there were no other customers at that moment. He makes an attempt to pour the coolant in and misses, getting it everywhere except where it needed to be. I can't hear him but I can see his mouth go through the motion of that famous word again... several times.

He comes back in.
""Can I get a funnel and some paper towels?"" It took a few seconds as I was turning around I swore I heard ""Please"". No, surely not.

""Absolutely, did you need any help out there?"" I say as I hand him a small stack of towels and a funnel. This guy was shaking so much in frustration he was about to break.

""No, I should be able to get it this time. Thanks though.""

Wait...what?

Fast forward to a few minutes later, he comes in to wash his hands. I figured he'd just leave afterwards. Nope. He stood in line again, this time less anxiously. He reaches the counter again and sighs.

""I'm sorry for being short with you. I had to drive all the way to the other side of the state to get my daughter and her stuff from her asshole boyfriend's apartment. My car is overheating and I spent everything I had getting over there and back.""

I carry on speaking with him for a few minutes about how her boyfriend must have been a major ass-hat and directing him to an auto shop down the road that did quick, free assessments.

By the time he left, he had a smile on his face and a freezy drink in each hand (because I felt bad and had extra coupons). Everything is better with freezies. Not a bad day.

**TL;DR -** Guy starts out as a jerk, slowly turns into a decent guy and apologizes for being a jerk. Also, freezies make the world a better place.

Lightfairy,182,,542,1m3mxa,,1394,"First time poster so a bit of background. I am a mature woman who has worked in an adult shop for nearly 12 months. I love my job. I work in a part of my town that includes some very colourful characters and some lovely people but also due to my work I have to, on occasion, deal with some very strange requests and some very strange/weird people. If you like my story I will post more as they happen on a very regular basis. 

Two days ago a very well dressed, conservative looking gentleman of around 50 entered the store. He wandered around for a bit of a look before approaching my counter. On the wall behind me is a leather display. Whips, canes, handcuffs and assorted bondage items. 

He looks up and says, 'Nice display. Do you sell a lot of bondage items.'

'Yes sir, they are quite popular', says I.
 
Looks me up and down 'Would you know where I could find a Master?'

To clarify here. A Master is a male dominatrix of sorts I suppose is the best answer. Someone who administers discipline to another and is paid to do so. This may involve being tied up, forced to perform various duties and may also involve whips and canes and other forms of discipline. I have no idea where to find a Master!! 

'Have you tried the internet sir?'
Then he floors me. 

'I am trying to find a Master to discipline my daughter.'
WTF!!

'My daughter has been unfaithful to her husband and we want to find a Master to teach her a lesson.'
Then he starts with the long story while I am trying to pick my lower jaw up off the shop floor!
'We have found one and he says that he would like to cane her. Of course her husband will be there for the disciplining session. The Master wants to give her 150 lashes with the cane to start with. Now I need your opinion. Do you think this is too excessive to start with or do you think 150 lashes is fair?'

Thankfully at this point another customer walked into the shop (a lovely regular that always spends big) so I replied to Mr Masterseeker with 'I honestly don't know too much about the bondage lifestyle Sir so I don't think I can comment on that and now I must go and help this gentleman. Have a nice day!'

We dealt with the snobbiest of the snobby as we were in a wealthy area of socal. While I was there I was playing poker full time as well, using the earnings from this job to cover me in the event of a losing night

So, one day I had this customer with his cart loaded to brim with everything from cookies to vitamins. I can already tell his bill is gonna be somewhere between $800-$1200. (Something easy to do in the store). Immediately the guy starts being a snob, ordering me to empty his basket while he stood there on his phone texting the whole time. He had me fetch several other items for him as well, not bothering to unload while I was gone. It took me a solid 10 minutes to ring up his items and another 15 to bag it all up, as he refused to lift  finger. So finally, when this all said and done his bill comes out to a little over $1300. This man had the audacity to sneer at me and say ""That's it? Pfft!"" and proceeded to slide his card. After punching in his info, his card was declined. He looked at me like I just took a shit on his chest. He said ""Run it again!"" So after 3 more attempts I finally ask him ""do you maybe have another card you can use? This one doesn't seem to be working. "" he responded with ""Don't take that tone with me! I make more money in a week than you do in a year! Run my damn card."" After several more attempts he demanded to talk to my manager, proclaiming it was my fault his card was declining.  After having my manager run his card several more times to the same result he just exploded with rage calling us criminals and that he was going to boycott the store. I was so frustrated and finally had enough with this asshole and exclaimed ""watch this!"" I took out my debit card ran it through the machine, typed in my pin and to his shock it went through. ""He started stammering in shock. I can only imagine what was going through his mind that this ""lowly cashier"" was able to buy his groceries no problem.

toxicpretty,121,,318,1a4yhv,,1370,"Ok, so my latest tale was well received (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1a3vgj/gave_a_bitchy_coworker_a_lesson_in_karma_while/) and so I thought I might share my favorite moment in the long and multifaceted job history that is mine. And it stars a decently famous person to boot...

When I was ten, I had the fortunate experience to begin work at a semi well known theater in Waterford, CT where many a star and playwright began their careers. This is a place that holds a coveted playwrights conference each year during the summer where many promising writers compete to have their best work fine tuned into  masterpieces. The pieces are given to promising young actors who work the plays each night, script in hand (rife with changes), in front of live audiences....bare props, simple sets....just the work. Each morning mentor directors and scriptwriters work with the playwright to interpret audience reactions and tweak the scripts till they shine. It's a fun, spontaneous place to work.

 Fortunately, my mother worked in the small print shop and after a few weeks of hanging around the theaters, I was give a job as an usher. It was an unpaid gig but it guaranteed entry and killer seats to any and all the plays during the season...and as a kid who loved theater, it was better than money. I worked there from the age of ten till I graduated high school and loved every minute. I have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the rest...

Two summers in, there came a time when our awesome stage manager had to quit for another gig. Being the most senior of the present ushers and mature for my age, the managers  of the theater asked if I would step in for a night or two while they filled the position..two days become a week and a week became a month and I was doing a really good job. But my hopes of keeping the gig were dashed when they filled the position with the mother of all insecure, power-heady bitches. She hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her job...and she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible. Often, after saving myself a seat with my jacket, I would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance. Her excuse? Only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status. Soon I could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if I stealthily did it when she wasn't looking. The hate was becoming seriously mutual and I had begun to think of quitting.

But I had to wait till the end of the month because I wanted to see one play in particular...a musical version of Fahrenheit 451. Besides being one of my favorite books, I had been watching the rehearsals for weeks and the score was amazing. It had two of my friends in it and it was rumored that the playwright had even invited Ray Bradbury to come to opening night....and he had accepted! I wasn't going to miss it for anything. 

That night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for CT. It was pouring and the wind was fierce. I had been extra careful reserving a seat for myself...or at least I thought I had. And it was a half hour from curtain. Suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded I go to the mansion to tell Mr. Bradbury's agent that  it was time to get seated.

Now let me explain ""the mansion"". This theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in Waterford. It had several amphitheaters and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonight's performance was. About a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that housed the theater offices, lounges, and the cafeteria. She essentially wanted me to run a quarter of a mile in the pouring rain to ask a guest to come down...despite the fact that there were phones. When I tried to argue, she threatened my position. I was pissed but I began to run. 

I show up breathless at the lounge in the mansion to see a piggish man finishing the vestiges of a huge meal. He hardly acknowledges me when I speak to him and then tells me that I'm ""dismissed""! By this point I'm getting way too pissed to even speak so I run back to the barn sopping wet. It's almost curtain time and as soon as I hit the barn, I scan for my jacket and my seat...only to find them moved to the back railing. It's now standing room only (which we allowed with our informal nature) and I'm done. Completely. 

I look around and see my manager speaking to a grey haired gentleman in the front row. I quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention. I tell my manager that I've done what she's asked and I'm going home. She actually smirks and walks away! Turning around to leave the gentleman says""Aren't you staying for the play? It's supposed to be wonderful."" I sigh and without thinking, I tell him that I've just had the worst night ever, lost my seat to an ungrateful boss, gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion, and that even though I was looking forward to it...well, it's obvious that its time to go home. He suddenly says ""I'm so sorry! My agent really is a self righteous ass, isn't he?"" That's when I realize who I'm talking to...Mr. Bradbury...himself! Between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics I'd seen of him, I hadn't even recognized him! I begin to apologize profusely for being so candid but he won't hear any of it...instead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come over.

Mr. Bradbury (suddenly all business):  ""This young lady is sitting with me this evening...I will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle."" 

Bitchy manager: ""But sir, she can't sit here...it breaks fire codes and besides... She's an u..usher!""

Mr. Bradbury: ""I don't give a crap about fire codes...she's sitting here or I'm not staying! Now get her a towel and a chair!""

She looks at me. I look at her. I smile a smile three miles wide. She sighs and slinks off! She ever so humbly returns with the requested items but this time can't make eye contact. I beam.

Mr Bradbury, gesturing to a seat dead front and center: ""My lady, shall we enjoy the show?"" I didn't walk....I floated.

And that, my friends, is how I got to spend an evening watching the coolest musical ever, sitting right next to Mr Ray Bradbury, discussing with him the finer points of the musical during intermission, and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be. After that night, my manager basically gave up being rude to me. She didn't last long after that and I went on to spend many a wonderful summers there!

chicdecay,268,,250,14obll,,1357,"So, I work as a cashier at a big box store that shall remain nameless. I'm planning on leaving at the end of the month (would have left by now, but I at least wanted to give them two weeks notice so they won't be short staffed at Christmas), so let's just say I put up with a lot less rudeness from customers than before. I'm still polite and try my best to give good customer service, but if a customer's giving me shit, I'll give it right back. Today was a perfect example of this.




I'm ringing up a well dressed older woman. She seemed nice at first and was buying a lot of Christmas decorations. I was making small talk with her and mentioned how this was my first Christmas living with my boyfriend and how excited I was to decorate our apartment. This was when shit hit the fan. She asked in a cold tone if I meant husband. I said no, we're engaged but not married yet. Suddenly she went on a tirade about how we're living in ""sin"" because we're living together but not married. I notice that every customer in earshot is staring and feel myself getting flushed. After about a minute of this I'd had enough. I voided her transaction and said ""I don't get paid enough to stand here and get insulted like this. I'm refusing you service. Go to customer service and pay there because I'm done."" 




She started to sputter ""How dare you talk to me like that? Call your manager right now! I'll have you fired!"" I couldn't help but smile. ""I'm planning on quitting anyway, so I really don't care. Actually, if I get fired I can leave early so you'd be doing me a favor."" She could tell I was serious and that her threat fell on deaf ears, so she stomped off to customer service screaming about what a whore I am (nice!).

FredFltStn,170,,544,1pdzxx,,1358,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  I think this week I'm going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

We had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around $1000 and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks. My dad greeted them and offered to show them around.

Dad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out. The entire time, these two were trying to work a better deal. I know most people don’t try to haggle when shopping at their local Target store, but hey, I get it, it's a fireworks tent, and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit, especially if you’re picking up a lot of stuff. These guys definitely took it to the next level.

My dad is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast, especially when someone is obviously going over the top. It’s one thing to offer a lower amount for an item, but when you start criticizing the products or my store, my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping you.

After about 30 minutes of this, I could see dad was pretty much over these guys, so I walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff, we would just give them 20% off their total order. They immediately protested that that wasn’t good enough, but I was pretty firm. I already know that I’m cheaper than anyone else, and 20% is a substantial discount. Hell, the only reason I did 20% is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and I wanted to get them out of the store.

The guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out. They fill out the liability waiver, and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff. After the cashier rings in their purchase, she waves me down, and I walked over to the counter to see what the issue was.

Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dumber (TD) were trying to pay with two $500 gift certificates. Now I give away a LOT of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions. The thing is, I only give away $50 gift certificates. These two idiots have obviously photocopied and altered a real gift certificate, and are trying to pass it off.

Now I’m pissed.

**ME:**  This is the worst forgery I’ve ever seen. You guys are idiots.

**TD1:**  I won those on the radio. They’re real.

**ME:**  My gift certificates are printed on custom paper, and I only issue $50 Gift Certificates. These are colored scans of a gift certificate and they’re not real.

**TD1:**  Yes they are!

**TD2:**  Besides, if you’re gift certificates don’t say no reproductions on them, you can make copies.

**ME:**  Yeah, that’s not what the law says. What the law DOES say is that you’re guilty of 3rd Degree Felony Theft for trying to steal $1300 of fireworks (their amount before the 20% discount).

**TD1:**  We didn’t try to steal anything!

**ME:**  You attempted to pay with a forged document. It’s the same as if you used a stolen credit card. I have your name, address, and multiple witnesses, and I fully intent to press charges. You guys can stay until the cops arrive, or they can arrest you at home, doesn’t matter to me.

**TD1:**  That’s not real. We didn’t steal anything.

**ME:**  Oh, because the last two times this has happened at my store (never actually happened before), the people were arrested and convicted of theft. I guess we’ll let the police sort it out. If you can’t pay for the fireworks, it’s theft.

TD1 and TD2 start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other. After a while, they insist that I’m wrong, but they’re willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it. 

They’re trying to figure out how to split up the $1000 when I informed them that the total was $1300. There’s no way in hell I was giving them a 20% discount after they tried to scam me.

In the end, they only paid for and received around $600 of fireworks, and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that. We were very careful with the signatures and I made the cashier copy down their driver’s license numbers, just in case they tried to dispute the charges. 

To be honest, I would have just let them leave if they had tried. It's not really worth my time or effort to press it, and I was actually just making it up as I went along because they pissed me off.

They definitely didn’t leave happy. My dad couldn’t resist when they were walking out.

**DAD:**  You dumbasses come back and see us again next year.

They haven’t been back.

As I have mentioned before, my family owns an automotive shop in Hayward, CA. We are open Mon-Sat, Sun we only do roadside assistance. Road service is done by one of my uncles.

One Sunday my Dad gets a call from a customer, he has brought a trailer to the shop, and demands that we go open the shop for him so he can have all the tires replaced. Dad tells him that the shop is not open on Sundays, if he wants service we will call my uncle and he will go do the job. Dad explains that the cost will be the cost of the service + $75 fee. 

The dude bitches about the fee, asking why he should pay it if he is at the shop. Explain that the shop is closed, and so we have to send the truck, this means a $75 fee. Finally he agrees.

Now our biggest money makers are big tires (11R22.5 and bigger) and Road side service, because we get TONS of road side service calls...all day, everyday. This means that ever time my uncle is doing a job, he was an average of 3 more waiting. (important info for later on)

So my uncle shows up at the shop, sets up outside of the shop because since the shop is closed we are not letting one in. My uncle walks into the shop to get the tires he needs then comes back out with the tires. He goes on, and does his job. charges the guy for the work it was like $475. No problem, the guy pays.

Customer: Okay, i'm going to take this trailer back to my lot, wait here i'm going to go get another trailer.
Uncle: sorry, no can do. I have 3 more guys waiting, I have to get to them.
Customer: I called you first though
Uncle: you called me about this trailer, you did not mention anything about any other trailers...I have to do the jobs I have been told about in the order in which I was told about them, im not waiting here, it wont be fair to them. 
Customer: Well let me just call my friend, he will bring the trailer, it wont take long I promise.
Uncle: no, sorry, look if you want that job done just tell me what you need, where the trailer is, and i'll get to it when I get the time.
Customer: Ok, I need XYZ done, how much will that be

I think it was something like a $500+ job so the guy is like
Customer: ARE YOU SERIOUS I JUST PAID YOU LIKE $400!!
Uncle: So, this is another job

....this is where it got weird
Customer: (remember, this is a dude) Come on, do it for free...tell you what, if you do it for free, and do it right now. I'll suck your dick

I tell Crazy lady, if she needs any help she needs to tell me. She pulls out a black dildo from her purse. She slams it down on the counter and screams she wants a refund, as she caught her daughter using it. I stare at her, and tell her we do not accept returns without a receipt and we do not accept returns of used dildos. I calmly tell her to take it off my counter as I don't know where that's been.

Crazy lady starts yelling that I am going to burn in hell, and she wants her money back. Again i calmly explain i can not accept this item. Crazy lady goes on a rant about how evil and sad I am for selling these items. ""Well, that's all fine and dandy but I don't really give a damn. Either buy something or get out as I am not accepting this item"", I explained as nicely as possible.

Crazy lady goes up in arms and starts waving the dildo in my face ""I want to speak to the manager!"", I smile ""Ma'am, I am the manager"", she gets red in the face and then screams she wants to talk to the owner. ""Ma'am, the owner is a busy man and can't always be here. I don't think you would like to see him mad. I am sorry ma'am, but, I can not accept a used dildo"".

So we're talking for a few minutes. Not long at all before an older woman, who had been seated at the bar by our espresso just staring at us, started almost screaming out, ""EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE. ME! HEY!"" 

My co-worker, who we'll call ""Sunny"", turned and walked over to her and asked her, ""How can I help you today?"" The woman stared at her for a few moments before saying, ""Are you done talking and ready to take my order? I'd really hate to inconvenience *you*."" 

Sunny handled it pretty well and explained to the lady that to make a to-go order she would need to approach the register and that we don't take those orders from seated customers; especially customers who already have bagged up food from whatever they ate dining in. Which, the lady did have several to-go boxes already with her.

The lady made a huge deal of getting up and walking over to the register. I decided to clock in while she waddled over to us. While I was punching in my number and tying my apron she just stood at the register I was at and stared at me. I directed her to the open register and she just stayed where she was. I then explained that I wasn't on the clock and Sunny will be more than happy to help her. She rolled her eyes and barked out, ""Mushroom soup."" 

I rolled my eyes and asked, ""Medium or large?"" 

""Large.""

Sunny went to the back to make it and I clocked in and rung it up for her. The lady kind of wandered over to our display and looked at it for a while. She came back to my register (I was standing at the open register this time) and just stood there. I was still in a pretty decent mood, despite how short and abnormally rude she was being. So I remained casual and waited for her order. She finally says, ""You need to take your hand out of your pocket.""

This is a terrible habit of mine. I always keep my left hand in my pocket and ring people up with my right. Now, because I don't handle food without gloves on... no one ever says anything about it. But I had the strong feeling that this wasn't really a big deal to her. At this point, something I did or said when I walked in the door made her hate me. I don't know what it was... but it was something.

I took my hand out of my pocket and raised my eyebrows in a, ''kay, let's get this show on the road so you can gtfo' kind of manner and she proceeded to say, ""I want one creme brulee.""

We have three different kinds of creme brulee. I asked if she wanted the one with sprinkles, berries, or vanilla. She just rolled her eyes and said, ""The creme brulee! Duh!"" 

So I just gave her whatever was in the back of the 'throw out in an hour' slightly smashed up against a metal rail in the cooler creme brulee and packaged her soup before ringing her up. She placed her money directly on the counter in front of my register where I couldn't reach it. So I had to come around to the front and pick it up and take it back to my till where I finished the transaction and put the money back on the counter and slid it over to her.

She took it, pocketed it, and grabbed her bag. Then she said, ""Can I have your name?"" Out of curiosity I just had to ask... ""Why? What have I done wrong besides put my hand in my pocket?""

She then looked at me with this look of pure hatred that I can't explain and said, ""This isn't your goddamn social hour. You come here to work. Not talk about how gross your food is, not to flaunt off how skinny you are, and not to show off your political views. This. Is. Work. Remember that when corporate fires you and you have to find a job at some other restaurant.""

I was shocked. Sure, my co-worker and I discussed the calorie count in our desserts. But my political views? So, being bold again I asked, ""I'm sorry, I understand that I did in fact make comments about the calorie count in our desserts. And I'm truly sorry if it offended you. Though, I'm just curious as to when I stated my political views.""

She then said, ""I saw that NRA sticker on the back of your truck when you pulled in. You represent this company, and now I'm never eating here again. In fact, you're pretty mouthy. Go get your manager.""

The NRA sticker on the back of my *husband's* truck. But fine, whatever. I got my manager who explained to her that a tiny, almost invisible round sticker with the letters 'NRA' on it was not grounds to get me fired. Neither was discussing the calories in an item. And that her behavior was inappropriate and turning into harassment and that he would appreciate it if she left.

The rest of the night was fine. But damn. I think she just didn't like me.

Lolawalrus51,89,,382,1lgus0,,1349,"I work at a chain corner store slash retail pharmacy, usually working checkout in the front. Yesterday I was only an hour into my shift when i saw a young boy walk in, maybe 4 or 5, and head right to the candy isle. I didn't see his parents walk in, so I kept an eye on him while he did his candy hunting.

After about 10 minutes, he came up to my register and set down 4 pieces of candy and asked me how much it all was. I rang it up and it was about $5.50 but he only had $4 in quarters. I told him this and he looked a little discouraged, and went back to find some different candy. Another 5 minutes passes and he comes back up with some smaller but cheaper candy and asked me to ring it up again. This time it was ~$4.50 and I gave him some of my pocket change so he could keep the candy. As the receipt was printing I asked him where his parents were. He gave me the biggest and toothiest smile and said; ""Mommy says I'm a big boy now! I can get my own candy."" Then he ran to the exit with this bag full of candy.

I decided to follow him because A) it wasn't busy and B) because I assumed he had walked from home to the store, or something similar. Turns out his mother was waiting right outside and had been watching our exchange the whole time. The mom sent the boy to her van and told me she was trying to teach him to be more independent. I guess giving him some autonomy to buy his own candy was a start.

I went back to the register with a smile on my face for the rest of the day because I can only imagine how good that candy must have tasted when you pick it out yourself and pay with your own money.

Cincythrowaway2,154,,440,1qgjyc,,1343,"I worked in a very large supermarket near Cincinnati. This store had everything a Cincinnatian could ever need -- your Cincinnati sports merchandise, Cincinnati-style Chili in cans, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, etc. 

Enter a lady and her friends. They walk right past all of the Cincinnati-related merchandise and go straight for the electronics. They request the most expensive stuff that we sell, and lots of it. Multiple laptops, multiple tablets, cell phones, etc. It's all in lockup, so the customers must tell the cashiers they want all of those things. Well, when one of them requested $15,000 worth of seemingly-redundant electronics, it caught the managers' attentions because *nobody* ever buys that much. Perhaps she was buying gifts for all of her friends in *Cincinnati*? Who knows?

The transaction was monitored closely by pretty much everyone in charge. The cashier, per procedure, requests ID from the lady. The lady presents it without hesitation. It's scratched up and looks a little flimsy for a government ID -- but hey, lots of IDs look weird like that. Right? So the cashier finally reads the info on the ID, which is as follows:

- Someperson Whatsherface
- 5555 Someplace RD
- **Cinncinati, OH** 45555

To the shock of everyone, her payment was declined. She tried to raise a *biiiiig* stink about it to get it through. She threatened to sue us, threatened to call corporate, made all sorts of threats. Still, we were forced to inform her that the machine wouldn't take her payment because the city of ""Cinncinati"" doesn't exist. Finally, the lady gives up. She takes her ID, payment, and leaves empty-handed with her friends.

But that's not the end of this story. This lady might not be able to spell the town that she lives in, but she's a *smaaaaarrrt* criminal with lots of tricks up her sleeve. That's why the very next day, she walked in to the *same* store, requested the *same* merchandise, and tried to present the *same* misspelled ID for verification.

Hello again, TalesFromRetail!  
My previous story, [The Chicken Nugget Hooker](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1icw8i/the_chicken_nugget_hooker/), received so much positive attention that I thought another story was needed.  
  
About a year after the aforementioned incident, I was working the Saturday night drive-thru shift again. It was fairly busy, as Saturday evenings tend to be. A very shiny rental car pulls up to the ordering microphone, and the driver begins ordering. He has a very thick French accent, and I have trouble understanding him, as the microphone is already in terrible condition. I ask him to repeat his order a few times. He is clearly agitated by the time he completes his order.  
  
A few minutes later, he pulls up to the drive-thru window. I walk over to take his payment. He informs me that he wants to change his order.  
  
""Hi, my wife does not want number 7 anymore. She wants number 3 now. Change it, please. Also add two milkshakes.""  
  
I inform him that I will be happy to change his order, but that there will be a small additional wait. He mutters something under his breath. I ignore the comment and begin making the milkshakes. I hear him and his wife conversing in French through the window.  
  
Now, I took French in high school. I was by no stretch of the imagination a good student. Madame Durand despaired that I only did enough work to squeak by with a C every semester. However, I could still make out phrases of the couple's conversation, and sometimes entire sentences.  
  
""Sad excuse for a restaurant...""  
  
""...stupid white boy, should go to university."" (They both laugh.)  
  
At this moment, I hatch a brilliant idea. I can't speak French that well, but I can well enough to get the point across. I begin recalling nouns and verbs from the many hours spent in French class. Madame Durand would have been proud.  
  
I take the payment for the order, hand over the food to the driver, and prepare myself. As he reaches for the milkshakes, I say to him in broken French,  
  
""I hope you enjoy your meal, sir. It was a pleasure to serve you today.""  
  
He looks at me, and gets that terrified deer-in-the-headlights look of someone caught red-handed. His eyes begin to bulge out of his head. My grin is wider than that of a Jack-o-lantern. I'm afraid that if my smile gets any wider, the top of my head will fall off.  
  
Then, the best thing that could possibly happen... happened.  
  
You know when your eye starts twitching randomly, and it just won't stop? It always happens during a job interview or a date, and it's the worst thing ever.  
  
My eye started twitching now. Not a little mini-twitch where you can hope the other person didn't notice, but a full-on Berserker Rage twitch. My eyelid was threatening to jump off my face and start a life of its own.  
  
This guy definitely noticed it. It was beautiful. A great interstellar drama spread across his face as his brain recategorized me from ""Obnoxiously Cheerful Food Worker"" to ""Twitching Psychopath Whom I Just Insulted.""  
  
This man wasted no time. Eyes bulging, he made a sound that can only be described as a strangled grunt and slammed the vehicle into gear. Not one to waste food, he seized both milkshakes from my hands and *tossed* them into his wife's lap. Her shrieking protests mixed with the squealing tires on the pavement.  
  
I never saw either of them again.

FredFltStn,235,,528,1qdrs0,,1330,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve. This story has absolutely nothing to do with that.

**STORY:**  My daughter and I spent the day in an Orlando theme park yesterday (not run by a mouse). Not the best idea, since it was a holiday weekend, but she loves Harry Potter, and I love here, so daddy will brave the crowds when she really wants to go.

While we were browsing in one of the stores, I saw some crazy lady going off on a poor cashier. I made my way near them so I could hear what was going on, partly because I felt like I should say something to the shitty customer, but mostly because I’m nosy as hell.

The customer was ranting about the price of something, and was basically accusing the cashier of trying to rip her off for charging so much. I honestly didn’t catch what item she was upset about, but apparently whatever it was, justified screaming at the poor female cashier behind the counter.

The female cashier had to be in her teens, and she honestly looked like she was about to break down and cry at any time. I REEEEEALLY wanted to step in and say something to the loudmouth, but I was worried about getting into an argument with some stranger in front of my daughter.

Enter the store manager.

The guy comes rushing over and plants himself between the screaming lady and the cashier. He did it so smoothly, I was jealous. He walked behind the counter and with a quick movement, used his arm to gently move the cashier back while placing himself in the line of fire. While he was moving the cashier back and stepping in-between them, he was looking at the screaming lady. By stepping in, he broke the customers’ eye contact with the cashier, and took it over for himself.

Smooth brother, smooth!

Then, even more impressively, he told the ranting customer that if she was unhappy with the price SHE SHOULD LEAVE! 

For those of you unfamiliar with theme parks in Orlando, this is definitely not the way it’s usually handled. Too often, the screaming guests get away with just about anything. Watching the outcome definitely made me feel good, and I was glad to see a manger stand up and put an unreasonable customer in their place.

Ten minutes later I was spending $117.65 for an “Authentic Ravenclaw Robe”. Maybe the lady was right.

Potential Customer - ""Hey, when do you guys close?""

Me - ""I'm making the rounds now, we close in 10 minutes.""

Potential Customer - ""OK, I'm gonna make it.""

And he hangs up on me. #1 - I'm irritated. It's a Saturday, I have stuff I have to get done, and I'm just about done cleaning and counting down the register. It's been a slow day. I'm ready to go. 

So I wait anyway. At 1 minute 'til I have shut down the register, turned off all my signs, and I'm about to lock the door. Nobody has come in. There's a phone call. 

Now I make a habit of not answering the phone at 1 minute until closing. There is only one reason anyone EVER calls me that late. It's to beg me to stay open. No. I'm not a slave. You could have been here at any other point in the day. And if you cant make it during regular business hours today, then come in tomorrow.

A pack of skittles, lip balm, and a soft drink was all he was purchasing. When I looked up to see the man behind the selections, a tall, stocky figure with a legendary mustache and a chipped front tooth greeted me. The bundle of facial hair was extremely thick, brown with spots of gray, and obviously something he took an enormous deal of pride in. My first instinct, as it usually is with anybody who has exceptional facial hair, was to compliment the man on his work of art.

He replied by thanking me and explaining how he hadn’t shaved it since 1973. When I asked why, he responds “Back in Vietnam, my best friend told me ‘if you ever die, I’m never shaving this here mustache’. We were always competing against each other so I told him ‘alright motherfucker, you got a deal.’  Three days later I saw him get shot in the head and this has been untouched ever since.”  I was completely taken back, obviously, and after a few seconds told him that was very honorable. To which he replied “no, that’s war,” took his change, and left never for me to see him again.

BaffledBuffalo,348,,519,1qou1o,,1315,"First time post! Apologies if I'm too long-winded.

Back in high school, I worked for a coffee chain. Let's call it Barschmucks. We had all sorts of customers and a few good regulars, but one of our regular demographics was the elderly. We were located very close to a pair of assisted living homes and were in a community that's 97% white and whose average home value was $900,000, so we had quite a few grandmas and grandpas coming in. 

One trend I noticed was that the old-timers would often want their drinks hot. They would almost never order cold drinks and they would request that their lattes be extra hot. We'd often be asked to microwave drip coffees because 170 degrees ostensibly wasn't hot enough for them.

So one day, a little old lady comes up and asks for a Zen tea, extra hot. No problem, my coworker rings her up while I make the tea. On our coffee maker, there's a hot water spout. You know, those red levers that dispense water? Well in case you didn't know, that water is at an off-boil (~205 degrees). It's hot enough that you can't hold the bare cup whilst filling it, lest you burn your hand. To make tea, you simply grab a cup, drop in the tea bag, fill it with the water, top it, and serve it. 

I do steps 1-3, but while trying to put on the top, the wall of the cup caves inward and sends 190-200 degree water all over my arms and hands. This isn't the first burn I've had working there, so I dutifully remade the drink immediately.

I hand the lady her new cup of tea and apologize for the hold-up. She takes a sip, frowns, and asks if we can make it any hotter. 

I look at her, down at the blisters forming on my hands, then back at her.

brynnflynn,181,,396,1h91nf,,1305,"Like many of you brave souls, I once worked retail. At one of the largest video game stores in the United States, in fact. It was a glorious time, just before the advent of corporate's fixation on reservations and subscriptions, but during the heady days of the newly launched XBox 360 and PS3. Systems flew of the shelves, Jack Thompson was the source of many a knowing chuckle, and I truly enjoyed going into work each and every day.

Now, because Jack Thompson was still a thing at that time, we had all been briefed over and over again that we could not sell rated M games to minors, and had to in every single case get the purchaser's ID. If the minor wanted the game, we had to get their parent to approve. No parent, no sale.

Cue the 13 year old gangster kid. He waltzed into the store all dressed up, trying to look as intimidating as a short, chubby pre-teen with ego issues could. I kept an eye on him, asked him if he needed help, and went about my business.

After about ten minutes he came up to the front desk with GTA San Andreas. He slammed it down on the front desk and announced, ""I'm getting this.""

Cheerful, delighted me replied, ""Of course! Can I see your ID?""

Blank stare. ""What?""

I helpfully flipped the game case over to the ESRB rating. ""I'm sorry, but since this is a rated M for mature game, I'm not able to sell it without your ID or your mother or father's permission.""

His eyes lit up. Little did I know, I'd given him the perfect out. With a hurried, ""One sec,"" he ran out of the store to fetch the parental unit. The parental unit in this case turned out to be his mother, or possibly grandmother, who clearly spoke little to no English as her frustrated chatter to her son revealed as she entered the store.

*""What do you need?""* she grumbled at him as they came to the desk.

*""The lady needs your ID, just show her your license and say OK,""* her son told her as quickly as he could. *""It's nothing, they're just stupid.""*

Now, you might have noticed I put that dialogue in italics. That's because it was conducted entirely in Spanish, and because, thanks to my public school education, I knew Spanish. Not well enough to write an essay, but definitely well enough to follow the conversation and know the son was trying to pull a fast one on Mom. Time for due diligence.

*""Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you, but your son wishes to purchase this mature game,""* I told her.

Her eyes widened. (Ed. note: I am the whitest white chick that ever walked the earth. I'm so white, my ancestors came over on the Mayflower.) *""Ok, fine,""* she replied, *""Let me get it.""* She started to rummage about in her purse while her son glared daggers at me.

*""There's a little more to it,""* I told her. I pointed deliberately to the M rating. *""This game has blood, violence, people having sex, naked people, drugs, and other assorted mature topics. I want to make sure you understand this before I sell him the game.""*

Her eyes got wider and wider with each strike against the game, as her son wilted more and more. When I finished, she whipped around, grabbed her son by the ear, and marched him out of the store flinging invectives and curses at him for trying to trick her into letting him get the game.

Backstory: So I'm 20 and work part time in a major UK supermarket. Our store is unlike most supermarkets in that there is no nearby car-park, and is located in the city centre. 

I am the 'lucky' person that gets to supervise the self-service checkouts. There is 9 in total for one person to supervise. One particularly busy period an obnoxious middle aged woman (OMAW) interrupted me whilst I was helping another customer and demanded I show her how to use the machine. I asked her to please be patient until I had finished helping the current customer and that I would be right with her.

When I got around to helping her, she had already attempted to use the machine herself, and had of course failed to follow any of the on screen instructions and had every possible error occurring at once.

Me: Ok you've actually put your items on the wrong side of the checkout which is why you're getting these errors. Don't worry a lot of people make that mistake. I'll just sort it for you.

OMAW: (Huffs, Sighs, Tuts etc)

Me: Is this your first time using one of these machines then?

OMAW: Yes I'm in a big hurry, I've just parked my car outside because I needed a couple of things before I go home.

(I glance up to where she indicated and see her car parked literally outside the front door of the store, right in the middle of a bus lane.)

Me: Right so all you have to do is... (I explain the procedure and even process a couple of items for her). Ok?

OMAW: Yes fine.

(I then go and help another machine that requires approval for alcohol before I get another tap on my shoulder)

OMAW: THE STUPID MACHINE IS BROKEN

Me: Well let's have a look. Ok you've actually put all your items into the bagging area, but none have been scanned.

OMAW: YES I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO 

Me: Well I'm afraid none of your items have registered if you did try to scan them, let's put them through again. (This time I process her entire basket just to try and get rid of her)

OMAW: YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN OUT OF YOUR TEENS. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME I DID IT WRONG, NO RIGHT AT ALL. YOU'RE JUST A STUPID LITTLE BOY.

Me: (Quite obviously shocked at the outburst) I was simply telling you what you may have done wrong.

OMAW: WHY DO THEY HIRE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SO RUDE. WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?

(I personally love it when this happens. So I go and get the manager, causing more delays for herself and the 8 other machines I'm supposed to be helping as well as a queue of people which has now formed)

Man(ager): Hello there what seems to be the problem?

OMAW: YES THIS IDIOT YOU'VE EMPLOYED IS BEING VERY RUDE

Man: Well we take abuse in out store very seriously, if I could just take some details off you.

(OMAW gives name, address and telephone number)

Man: Ok thank you for that. I'd like to now tell you that you will be placed on the list of customers banned from the store. I will not tolerate abuse to my staff. Good day. 

OMAW: WHAT? I WORK FOR THE COUNCIL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 

Man: I'm afriad I can, now are you going to leave or shall I call security to escort you off the premises?

OMAW: I'M GOING, BUT I WILL CLOSE THIS STORE DOWN, JUST YOU WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK TO THE OFFICE.

Man: Ok then have a nice evening.

OMAW storms out of the store, gets into her illegaly parked car and drives the wrong way down a one way road straight into the path of an oncoming police car, who gives her a fixed penalty notice on the spot, all right outside the front of the store.

OMAW looks around exasperated, and then looks straight at me as I stand there staring right back, with a huge grin on my face.

Anyway, Idiotman walks up to me and says ""Hey you, come hear,"" in that rude voice which means something has happened to him that is inexplicably my fault. I walk over to him and he is pointing at the shelved area where all the new bread rolls we get everyday are kept. Idiotman is giving me dagger eyes and he starts shouting whilst pointing at an empty shelf of 99 cent rolls ""I come here everyday and you're always out of these fucking rolls!"" along with other complaints, including how he works such a hard schedule and he *deserves* a roll which fate has somehow unfairly cheated him out of.

Now I am a bit flabbergasted at this man. There is nothing I can do to get him more bread rolls because they are only delivered once a day but more importantly there is a bakery right next door where he could probably get a cheaper and tastier bread roll. My go to response is the usual ""Sir I'm sorry, I can't help you but I can get you the manager if you would like?"" But alas Idiotman is a veteran in the field of being a dick to staff and obviously understands that if someone with authority tells him leave there is not much he can do about it.

He tells me that I have to deal with the situation for some ungodly reason but I don't want to be rude, plus it is apparently my moral duty now to ensure this man gets his bread. So I say politely ""Sir there is not a lot I can do about the situation, have you considered going to the bakery next door?"". Unfortunately for me, idiot man is offended by common sense and so now he *wants* me to get the manager so he can tell him ""How inappropriate it is to tell a customer to shop elsewhere!"" Which according to Idiotman is what I was doing. So I go get my manager who is awesome and tell him that some man wants a bread roll which we are out of and is angry because I told him to go to the bakery.

My manager comes back to the man with me and asks what the problem is. Idiotman tells my manager ""You are out of these fucking bread rolls and your staff member has been very rude to me."" My genius boss looks at him wide eyed and out of nowhere sprints to the front of the store. Idiotman and I follow and as we reach the entrance we see my manager standing in the doorway looking at the bakery. For about a minute he stands in the doorway staring at the bakery and then looking back at the man, back and forth and back and forth with utter confusion on his face. 

Eventually he turns to Idiotman and asks ""Sir you know there is a bakery right next door right?""

I only kept it together long enough for the man to drop his basket and storm angrily out before losing my shit.

Foxfyre,376,,425,1mycuz,,1284,"Hello TFR!  Been wanting to post a story here for a while but I couldn't decide on one. 

This one comes to you from 13 years ago!  Our tale starts in a big blue box department store in a small town. I was fresh out of high school and working there back when they actually gave full time jobs. I was a Jack of all trades pretty much. Cashier, stock, service desk, cart pusher. 

On this day I was outside pushing carts. It seemed like any other day, and pretty soon it was lunch time.  I head back to the break room and grab my lunch. I would later wish I'd headed out to eat that day. Luckily I had time to finish eating and by now am just relaxing and chatting with coworkers. The phone in the break room rings and someone answers it. They holler at me and tell me I have a call.  The person on the other end is a girl from the service desk telling me an officer wanted to speak with me. 

What? Really?  I crack up laughing. I've never had a problem with the law...is this a prank?  Next thing I know,  I hear this loud male voice in my ear.  ""Sir, this is Officer I'm a Prick and I Know It,  and I need you up front NOW.""  

Well drat.  WTF is going on? So i trudge the long way through the huge store back up front and find the officer. He proceeds to ask me if I saw a purse while I was outside cart pushing. Nope,  sure didn't officer. He of course,  doesn't believe me. ""Well a lady lost her purse and says she saw you outside pushing carts at the time. ""  That's great officer.  She probably saw me as I was heading back in for lunch so I wouldn't have wound up pushing her cart. ""Did you drive to work?"" he asks me. Yup. Sure did.  So he has me show him to my car. Asks if he can look inside. I've got nothing to hide so I let him. He opens all the car doors, pops the hood and the trunk looking for this ladies purse. During the process of searching my car, he found a check my grandma wrote to my girlfriend for her birthday and took it. He also found an old ID that a friend had left in my car that I never knew was there and gave me hell for having some else's ID. 

Quizzed me heavily about the check. Told him it was a check from my grandmother to my girlfriend and she rode into work with me so she left it in the car. ""Oh,  she's here too?""  So...we go walking back into the store where he has me point her out so he can give her the check back. She glares at him and hands it right back to me. He then grabs it from my hand and gives it back to her and tells her not to give it to me again. She gives him the evil eye and says he's the one with the bank account,  he's going to be cashing it for me, and as soon as you leave, he is going to be the one holding it again. With that she walked away. The cop looked pretty mad. He starts quizzing me if I have a locker in the back. Nope, I don't. They only give lockers to girls. Then he tries to coerce a confession out of me.  Not happening bud, I didn't do Shit. 

Finally he leaves. At this point it's been over 2 hours, he'd kept me from working and I was still off the clock from lunch. I went and raised hell with the managers, but all they did was tell me I'd be paid for the lost time and that was about it. 

So there we have it. The story of how I had to be guilty because in very busy shopping center, I was the only minimum wage peon in the area so it had to be my fault.  

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone who's reminded me what my rights are when dealing with a cop.  Rest assured, I am well aware of them.  However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this story, this was 13 years ago, I was a punk teenager who had never been in trouble with the law, and honestly I had no clue and was completely freaked out that it was even being insinuated I was guilty of a crime.","Yes, officer!

FredFltStn,326,,582,1pjbka,,1284,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax with the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**WARMUP:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying (and occasionally winning).

You know it’s going to be a long day when the guy wearing the dark suit and standing in front of you pulls out his Secret Service Identification.

Most of the people who buy fireworks from me use credit cards. I’m actually pretty happy about that. Even though I have to pay fees on each transaction, it reduces the possibility of theft, and I don’t have to deal with as much cash.

Believe it or not, most banks now charge you a fee if you deposit more than $5000 in cash to your account during a single billing period. Yep, it’s bullshit, but if all banks are doing it, what’s your alternative?

That being said, we still receive a fair amount of cash during the course of our sales season, and I do everything I can to reduce my risk. My cashiers all use money pens to check the large bills, we try not to keep a lot of cash in the register drawers, and our friendly local police escort me to do cash drops at the bank when needed. Overall, we’ve had very few problems.


**STORY:**  One of my cashiers called me over because the $100 bill she was holding didn’t look right. The paper seemed right and it passed the pen test, but the printing on the bill did seem a little off. The lady who had paid with the $100 bill was getting impatient, and in the end, I just assumed the bill was old and worn (we do see that a LOT). 

Apparently, the night deposit I made on the 4th of July had several of the bills, 8 to be exact. Guess who showed up at my tent on July 6th to discuss it!

The Agents were actually very nice. They couldn’t give me many details, but apparently the woman who had passed the bill was no stranger to them. I’m not sure if she had made multiple purchases at my store, each with a phony bill, or if she had accomplices. I gave them my statement, but I honestly didn’t have much to tell them.

The Agents did say that the bills were actually very high quality, and that we were lucky to have noticed anything wrong. I didn’t feel very lucky. In the end, I was scammed out of $800.

**To the lady who scammed me:**

I have a container of explosives and a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If I see you in my shop again….

He started laughing, no doubt at the fact he used foul language during the customer/employee interaction... A social taboo, I do believe.

Without missing a beat, I respond in perfect deadpan voice; ""Sir, I'm going to murder that motherfucker with chocolate.""

My entire shift turns to me and looks like I'd just read a page off of the Necronomicon, all while the guy at the ordering box is bursting with uproarious laughter.

My managers give me a verbal warning, but it was pretty clear that I'd made the guy's day, so they didn't take any ""real"" action against me.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Someone else had posted a good [story](http://redd.it/1q5rop) about a shopper showing up at closing time and just browsing. It reminded me of this story.

As you can imagine, we get crazy as hell the closer it gets to the 4th of July. I try to staff accordingly, but of course things never go as you plan them.

July 2nd should have been a very busy day for us. What it actually turned out to be was a madhouse, and we did almost twice the business I had forecasted.  I’m not complaining, there were a lot of high fives given that day, but after being on my feet for 15 hours, I was damn tired.

We had closed the store at 10pm, an hour after we were supposed to. I had sent home the cashiers around 9:45pm, since they were supposed to be back at 7:30am the next morning, and the only people left were, my dad, one of my employees, and me.

We turned off the lights, lowered the sides of the tent and locked up the fence. I was walking to my car with the cash drawer when a car pulled up.

The guy was a regular customer and a friend. He was having a party and wanted to grab just a few things. I felt bad for him, so we unlocked the fence, and walked back inside. He started running around and grabbing the stuff he wanted while I put the cash drawer back in the register.

Of course, two minutes later, a group of 5 people walk into the tent. I told them we were closed, and that they had five minutes to shop, figuring that’s about what it would take my friend to finish.

And then the human tsunami hit…

I don’t know where the hell they were coming from, but people started pouring into the tent. This is a tough situation. First, I’m there to make money, but I was tired as hell, I still had to swing by the bank for a drop, and I didn’t really have the staff to handle the crowd. I sucked it up, and started ringing in sales as fast as I could. Around 10:45pm, I announced to the few remaining shoppers that they had 10 minutes left.

At 11:10pm, I’m trying to get the last two people out of the damn tent. They’ve obviously been partying, and they’re just taking their time browsing. At 11:20, they’re holding maybe $10 of stuff in their hands, and just laughing and stumbling around. I finally can’t take it anymore. I walk up to the couple and tell them that we’re closed, and that they need to check out now if they want to buy anything.

The guy immediately gets an attitude, and tells me that they’re not done shopping yet. I get an attitude and explain to him that yes, in fact they are. He drops his stuff on the floor in front of me, and heads for the door. As the couple is walking out, a truck pulls up.

I’m tired, hungry, and ready for a shower. As the guy is stepping out of the truck, I don’t even bother to look up, and just call out, “We’re closed”. 

**GUY:**  Come on man. I want to pick up some stuff.

**ME:**  We were supposed to close at 9pm. It’s 11:30, and I’m ready for bed. You’ll have to come back tomorrow. We open at 8am.

**GUY:**  Yeah, but it’s going to be busy tomorrow. I don’t like shopping when it’s crowded.

**ME:**  It’s going to be a madhouse tomorrow. I’d get here early if I were you.

**GUY:**  Can’t you just let me get my stuff now? A friend of mine told me about your place, and said you guys could just put a package together for me. I want to spend around $1500.

**ME:**  Welcome to &lt;my company name&gt;. Come on in, we’re open.

Cried at work for the first time] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/178lwi/people_can_be_vicious_cried_at_work_for_the_first/) about three months ago, I got a lot of PMs. Not regarding Jill or other customers, but regarding my manager. These past few weeks have been absolutely insane. 

Since this incident, our staff began to have more and more problems with this manager disrespecting us, embarrassing us, and just making our lives miserable. We came close to having a lot of great people quit and we went home every night absolutely hating our jobs. Things got really bad for a while. Finally, I decided enough was enough and I gathered everyone that had talked to me about their issues with him, and decided to take it to our store manager and have one big meeting. 

This decision terrified me. I haven't been there nearly as long as some of the others and I'm low on the food chain. My decision could have gotten me in serious trouble, or even terminated. I figured if I was going to get fired for speaking up about the harassment we were enduring, then I didn't want to work there anyways. 

The meeting lasted about an hour or so and we didn't even get everything out that we had wanted to say. It was time to go back to work. We were told things would get sorted out. The next day, I come in to this weird aura. Everyone was in a good mood, customers were happy, and I didn't see the grumpy, miserable faces I usually saw when I got to work. 

My manager no longer worked for the company. This was enough to celebrate, but what would come next was even better. We all began to wonder who would take his job. We all got along with each other so it was fair game. They talked for a while about hiring someone brand new and that made us a bit nervous. It could be someone just as bad, or worse than the original manager. 

There's a lot of meetings and closed doors and finally, I get called in. Long story short, I got the job. I'm young, and have no experience with management and I got the job. I'm beyond proud of myself and I'm excited to see what I can do for our store. Things are turning up!

It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven, with industrial rack shelving and more than 300 items in stock. I make sure that my prices are the best around, and I take a lot of pride in hand picking my inventory and selecting only the best stuff. I even have some items custom made and imported from China with my own label. What can I say, I’m a pyromaniac.

I’m a big believer in customer service, and I make sure everyone that works for me knows that we take care of our customers. I want everyone to leave with a smile on their face. That being said, sometimes, you just can’t win.

My parents are retired and my dad and mom help me out a lot at the fireworks tent. My dad is laid back and super friendly. He does an amazing job chatting up the customers and helping them out.

One day, this bonehead (BH) strolls in and starts browsing the shelves. I’m behind the counter, but my dad welcomes the guy and asks if he needs any help.  BH mumbles no and starts walking around the shop. After a while, I hear BW call out to my dad and say that our prices are way too expensive.  Not a big deal. This actually happens a lot, with people trying to work a deal. My dad is super cool and tells BH that we’re always willing to match anyone else’s price for the same item. My dad walks over and I can hear BH telling my dad how we’re double the price he usually pays for the stuff. My dad and I both know this is BS, but dad just keeps smiling and tells BH that we try to have the best prices, and that he doesn’t know of anyone that is cheaper, but we can beat their price if he can tell us who carries it for less or has an advertisement from the other company. This apparently pisses BH off. He raises his voice and starts ranting about how we’re too expensive, pointing at items and telling us how much cheaper they are at his imaginary place. 

Then this exchange takes place:
BH:  See this item right here (pointing at one of our custom made pieces). I’ve bought this exact same item for less than half of this price. You guys are just trying to rip me off. I’m not going to pay that price for this thing. I’ll give you $20, and that’s more than it’s worth.

DAD:   I’m pretty sure you didn’t get that particular item from anywhere else. We have it custom made for us. See how it even has our name on the label?

BH:  (Yelling) Bullshit. All of the stuff you’re carrying is junk. I can get this stuff cheaper anywhere. Rambles for another couple of minutes telling my dad that this company is a joke and that we’re lucky he’s even bothering to buy our crap.

DAD:  (cold as ice) Get the Fu*k out.

BH:  (Yelling) I’m going to have your ass fired old man. 

I walk out from behind the counter and over to where this is going on. I smile and tap BH on the shoulder.

ME:  I’m sorry sir, I own the business. How can I help you?

BH:  Your employee was rude and just cussed at me! I can’t believe you have people like that working for you.

ME:  I’m so sorry. What did he say to you?

BH:  He told me to Get the Fu*k out.

ME:  Are you sure?

BH:  YES!

ME:  (smiling) Then get the Fu*k out.

BH just stands there like he doesn’t understand what I’m saying. I point to the exit. He starts walking away cursing up a storm and yelling how he’s going to tell everyone what a horrible place this is. My dad and I are damn peeing ourselves laughing. This happened years ago, but it’s still one of our favorite catch phrases at the tent.

Me:  I need to run to the bank to get more singles.

AshieeRose,259,,421,1o4rn4,,1249,"I live near Sydney, and today was a pretty damn hot day, 37C (about uh 98F?). We had a full fire alert for the state and it was hot even at 9am.

Thankfully I was working today, so I was able to enjoy the AC in the store. It's business as usual, with a hot topic being the ridiculous weather. We had some customers linger and take their time getting their carts, because they just did not want to leave. 

I suddenly hear my manager and a coworker exclaiming in a half-panic, ""WHAT?! There's a CHILD IN A CAR?!"" and racing outside to try and find the vehicle. Middle of the day, sun fully blazing, and there's a fucking kid locked in a car. 

The woman I'm serving suddenly gets quiet, her head down, and rather impatient to get through checkout. It dawns on me - the mother is the woman I'm serving. 

Knowing I would get into shit if I blatantly confronted her, regardless of how angry it made me, I used it as a conversation. 

Me: ""Gee, that's so irresponsible, hey? Imagine someone leaving their child in a car on a day like this? So many news stories and pleas from emergency personnel to not do it, and this *mother* does it on the hottest October day in 70 years? Sheesh. Some people shouldn't be parents."" 

The woman mumbles and nods, and becomes more impatient. I quickly get through the rest of her items and send her on her way, gesturing her to the coworkers as she rushes out the door with her tail between her legs.

**STORY:**  You can’t imagine the things people offer to trade for fireworks. In my business, the barter system is alive and well, and I'm always willing to listen to a trade proposal. Heck, I’ve even made more than a few barter offers myself. Here are a few of the things I’ve bartered for over the years.

* My 6 x 12 dual axle utility trailer was paid for half in cash, and half in fireworks.

* This past year, I had a gentleman trade me Silver Eagle coins for fireworks.

* I’ve traded advertising and promotional spots for fireworks.

* I’ve traded pizza and catering for fireworks.

* I’ve traded on site electrical work for fireworks.

* My chilled water dispenser was a trade for fireworks that I bartered off of Craigslist.

But my favorite trade by far, happened three years ago this New Year's Eve.

A guy walked into my tent and asked to speak to the manager. The company he worked for was throwing a New Year's Eve party, and he wanted to know if I would be interested in doing a trade for fireworks. I told him maybe, and asked what they wanted to trade.

He led me outside to his SUV and popped the back. 

I can only hope that one day, when I eventually die and I arrive at the pearly gates to be greeted by St. Peter, that I experience the joy and amazement that I felt at that very moment.

There, beaming up at me from the back of that magical SUV, were more than 3 dozen bottles of premium spirits. There were a dozen bottles each of Makers Mark, and Knob Creek. The rest were assorted high end bottles of Scotch, Vodka, and Whiskey, with two bottles of whiskey in a plain white label that were sent to distributors for tasting and we're not on the market yet (they were FANTASTIC).

It turns out that he worked for a local liquor distributor, and I can guarantee you that they had an amazing fireworks show that New Year's Eve. My employees were also VERY happy with their additional NYE bonus.

DeaditeQueen,203,,418,1llp4h,,1241,"When I had just turned 18 I was working as a cashier at a now defunct grocery chain. The money and hours sucked but I was at that point in life where I needed to make some money while deciding what the hell to do with my life.

Our store had an employee policy that basically stated that if you went on break and bought something to eat there, you could ring yourself up for it after you were off break. Essentially if you grabbed some hot wings and a soda you didn't have to pay until you came back. Simple. 

My period was late, I was nauseous, etc. All day at work I was sweaty and nervous hoping to GOD I wasn't pregnant (there had been a condom breakage, I wasn't simply irresponsible). My break came and I worked up the nerve. I knew we had pregnancy tests on sale and I went and grabbed one. While in the aisle I noticed our LP guy doing his rounds and thought nothing of it. I took my test to the bathroom with the intent of discretely ringing it up as soon as I was off break and getting rid of the box. It was only $5 and due to a lucky scratch off ticket from the day before I had $70 in my purse (relevant).

I follow the instructions and BOOM, I'm preggers. I was in disbelief, panicked and sweating profusely. My head was spinning. I put the box in the pocket of my apron, pull myself together for the last few hours of my shift and begin trying to figure out how I was going to tell my mother. 

As I'm walking down one of the aisles towards the registers the LP guy swept up behind me, grabbed the back of my arm quite forcefully and without a word dragged me to the back offices. I kept asking what the hell was going on but he wouldn't speak. He placed me in his office, left and locked the door! What the fuck was going on!!!

A few minutes later he returned with the manager and my piss soaked stick test in his gloved hand! He began to accuse me of stealing! I quickly retorted that he had grabbed me on my way to my register and just like everything else an employee grabs when on break I was going to pay for it once I was back on my register.

My manager seemed confused and unsure of the LP guys accusation and asked if I actually had the money to pay for it. My purse was in a hidden cubby under the register and he went and got it for me while LP guy takes it upon himself to call the cops. My manager returned and I proceeded to show him that I had more then enough money to pay for the item.

LP guy shoots back that I wouldn't of tried to ""hide"" the box in my apron if that's what I was going to do. I angrily explained that I didn't need the whole store knowing my business and I was going to be discrete. He wasn't going for it. In a store frequented by wealthy elderly people shoplifting wasn't an issue and I believe in his mind he was finally getting the chance to ""bust"" someone. 

I demanded to call my mother. No, it wasn't because I needed my mommy it was because I wanted a ride home. ""You're 18 sweetheart. No mommies here!"" and he ripped the phone from my hand. Up until this point I had raised my voice but had refrained from cussing, name calling, etc. I had just found out I was pregnant and within minutes of trying to soak that in I had a man who had obviously failed the training to be a cop accusing me of trying to steal a $5 pregnancy test. I was ""emotional"" and I don't think anyone could blame me.

He slammed a piece of paper in front of me and began to demand I sign it. It was a statement saying I admit to stealing. I refused and attempted to leave. He blocked the door and told me I wasn't going anywhere and physically seated me again. He kept screaming and pointing at the paper and I was praying that the cops would just show up. He tells me I can't leave the office until I sign it and left the room locking the door behind him. It was a big door and there was no way I could force it down. I took the opportunity to call my mom and simply got the words ""Come quick"" out of my mouth before he stormed back in and removed the phone from the room altogether. At that moment I tried to juke him to get out of the office to find he had manned the hallway with some of the stock guys and I was physically pushed back into the room and locked in once again.

I was in complete panic mode. After what seemed like a lifetime I just signed the paper and as I was sliding it under the door as proof I heard the sounds of police radios. FINALLY!!!!

LP guy opens the door an enters with 2 officers. He had obviously already gone thru his version of things and now they wanted to hear from me. I went thru the whole thing and the stock guys confirmed that paying for things post-break was common. I showed them my money, etc. They could tell I was flustered and one noted the pee stick in the table and saw that it was positive.

They talked amongst themselves for a few minutes before I heard my mother at the customer service desk demanding to know where I was (she don't play). The Officers close the door so it's just me, LP guy and them.

""Did she attempt to leave the store without paying?"" one asked

""No. I caught her in the aisle."" LP responded

""So she wasn't near an exit, running? Anything like that?"" one of them asked.

""No. Caught the sneaky bitch before she could leave.""

To me, ""We're you clicked back in?""

""Yes. I was headed to my register to pay like EVERYONE does.""

""Lying bitch"" LP shot back. Meanwhile I could hear the manger trying to keep my mom from ripping his throat out (yes my mother is THAT tough)

""I was gonna leave? I don't have a car! I don't even drive you fucking moron!!"" 

The officers turned to LP guy who was gripping my signed statement, ""Ok. From what we've gathered she was in the clock, and following your stores policy. She didn't try to leave so no shoplifting or attempted shoplifting occurred.""

LP began to argue only to be met by a quick and authoritative hand in his face, ""Sir, you moved this girl against her will about 400 feet. Another hundred and we'd be arresting you for kidnapping. You locked her in this office. That's imprisonment (he may have used a different term, can't recall) and the fire Marshall would have your head.""

LP shoved the paper at them. ""She admitted it!""

The officer grinned, ""That was signed under duress and my partner and I will testify to that if need be. If you lock someone in a room long enough you can force them to admit to just about anything.""

Second cop, ""Miss, this seems like a real shitty case of jumping the gun. Do you want to press charges?""

""HER?!? For what?!"" LP guy freaked.

""I just told you. You'd be better at your job if you watched AND listened.""

I told them ""No"". Not only did I have to tell my panicked mom I was pregnant but I had to explain this too. I didn't want to get wrapped up in any of that. I just wanted to go home and cry. I put the $5 on the desk table and one of the officers escorted me to the customer service desk and assured my mother I wasn't in trouble, in fact I was a victim. My manager was clueless as to what had just happened and the officers merely told him ""She could have brought major trouble for this place. I wouldn't fire her if I were you.""

Before he could answer I merely said ""Fuck this job!"" and left with my mother. A year later the chain went bankrupt and a few months after that I saw LP guy pumping ppl's gas in NJ. If you're out their LP guy, FUCK YOU.

**EDIT** First of all thank you for all your kind words!! I never expected one of the worst days of my life would touch so many people. Looking back, yes I should have pressed charges. In that moment tho, I just wanted out. I'd never had any dealings with the law before this and had no idea what ""pro bono"" meant, etc. My whole life had changed in that bathroom and my head was swimming and I felt like I was trying to breathe underwater. If something like this happened now, I would be all over it with an army of lawyers but at the time I was still a kid. I have no idea if they fired LP guy over this. I only went back 2 weeks later to collect my final paycheck. I could of had it mailed, but I wanted to walk in with my head held high and that's just what I did. A small way of taking back my own sense of security. I hope no one ever has to go thru what I went thru that day, and I also hope that if anyone's rights are violated they are braver then I and do press charges. That is something I regret immensely about the situation but in my eyes at the time an 18 year old vs an army of corporate hired lawyers didn't make for good odds.

FredFltStn,207,,497,1qz4m9,,1242,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

Engineer_Man,141,,450,1j3jfu,,1236,"I have recently lost a chunk of weight, about 20% of my starting weight I have changed my body shape quite dramatically, as you can imagine. My gym partner, is a very well toned, athletic female who Crossfits. She also loves Paleo, just so you understand. I gym, I obstacle race, I still carry a bit of weight. She grew up in Italy, and has a competent grasp on the Italian language, where I know as much as Mario and Luigi, and occasional Bolognaise Sauce advertisement.

I am heading out to dinner this weekend with friends, so I task my gym buddy to aid me choosing a new outfit. Not only am I a male, I am an engineer. Clothes for me are functional, I am in desperate need of a queer eye, or someone who understands fashion, hence the tasking of said female friend.

We are in the local Jeans shop, I am squeezing into jeans not only in cuts that I never thought were possible, but sizes which I never would have thought I would wear since primary school. As I am trying on a pair of jeans, I hear two guys in the changerooms just up from me spark up a conversation. The most I can gather is they want to speak only in Italian, not in English. After that, I lose track of what they are saying.

At the moment I walk out of the changerooms for an opinion, my friend turns to them, says something vicious and rapid in Italian. These two guys turn bright red, turn, put down their potential purchases, and slowly start backing out of the changerooms and shops entirely.

After watching this whole debacle, and after they left I turn to my friend and give the biggest WTF look I have. it turns out they started ragging on me from the moment I entered, and culminated in the sentence ""What does a guy like him think he should be doing in public with a lady like her"". This is when she decides to pipe in with "" Do you realise I understand everything you just said? Thank you, and fuck you!""

I couldn't stop laughing. The two floor staff came to see if I was OK, and we relayed the story to them and they then told us they couldn't understand why these two guys left in such a hurry. We had a good laugh for about 10 minutes, I made my purchase and we left.","Do you realise I understand everything you just said? Thank you, and fuck you.",1686,talesFromRetail

keglamorphic,267,,246,180fv6,,1214,"I worked at a big box warehouse type store a few years back and it's one of those stores that have branded credit cards with the person's face on it. It always baffled me that customers would write ""CHECK ID"" or ""SEE DRIVER'S LICENSE"" on the back of them but, as I was supposed to do, whenever someone put that on their card I would ask for their actual ID.

Most people would say, ""WHY?! MY PICTURE'S RIGHT THERE!""

""I know, but you wrote 'CHECK DL' in all caps where your signature should be so I am obligated to ask.""

From this point, one of two things would happen:

1) They'd show me their ID apologetically and feeling a little stupid

2) They'd continue to call me stupid or act like I was a neanderthal while showing me their ID.

In my earlier posts, I mentioned that this store was in a higher income neighborhood so we had a lot of people in their golf attire come in. One such fellow did. Polo shirt tucked into his khakis, white visor, graying hair, and a goatee. He was a portly fellow, possibly from eating too much wine and cheese.

At this point in my career, I'm sick of the job and my shit-taking levels are at record lows. He clearly wrote, ""Check Driver's License"" on the card with his photo on it so before I charged it, I asked for it.

""That's me.""

""Yes, I know it's you but since you wrote to check your license, I have to ask.""

""That's fucking stupid. I'm not taking out my ID.""

""I'm not charging the card then.""

""You little shit, do you know who I am? I'm not taking out my ID.""

""I have no idea who you are because you wont show me your ID.""

The line is long as all hell because it's one of those stores and it's a weekend and it's coupon time. 

""Well, I'm not leaving until you ring me up,"" this asshole says.

At this point, I give him back his card.

""Alright, then. Ring yourself up,"" I said, locked my register and walked away. 

Some supervisor finished his order while I ate a Snickers bar in the breakroom and watched whatever was on the TV. I didn't get into any trouble because the customers after him told the supervisor what a dick the guy was.

Anyways, yesterday I was working and it was a busy day for a Sunday.  (I live in a religious area where not many people go do stuff on Sundays)  

The entire day people had been ruder than usual.  I usually have no problems with my job, everyone is nice and I enjoy being nice to people and helping people out when they have questions but it seemed that yesterday everyone was grumpy for some reason.  Nothing big enough to make a post solely about that, but grumpier than usual.

I was stocking some cucumbers when someone touched my shoulder and said, ""Excuse me, Young man."" Right when I heard this I got a little nervous because I've learned in my time on the job that when someone is going to be especially rude, it's an elderly man.

I turned around and put on my smile and said, ""Yes? How can I help you?""

I was expecting a rude tone about something because his face seemed a little distressed but instead he smiled as well and said, ""Do you have any corn?  There isn't any in the bin it's usually kept in.""

I realized that I had been stocking everything else but somehow in the rush of the day I had forgotten to stock the corn and now it was empty, causing a misfortune for a lot of customers.

""I'm sorry sir.  I'll hurry and get the corn from the back.  I know we have some back there."" and I rushed off to get the corn.

When I got back I began to stock the corn.  The old man stayed around though and began to have a conversation with me.  He was a very nice old man and asked how long I'd been working at where I worked at, how the day was going, if my boss was working me hard. 

It was nice to actually have a person kind of appreciate what I was doing instead of acting like I was their slave.

As I finished stocking the corn and went back to my other tasks I said to him, ""I'm sorry I didn't have the corn stocked originally, that was my fault.""

He said, ""Don't worry about it.  Even if you didn't have any corn, there are more important things in life than corn.""

The old man's conversation made me happy the rest of the day.

I wish that every person who gives me a glare or mutters something under their breath whenever I say we're out of something would understand that there are more important things in life than [item] and that being rude isn't going to get them what they want.

There's this huge fad out right now with this rubber band weaving loom. We carry them, and right now they're on sale and so are the individual packages of refill rubber bands. The display they're set up on is RIGHT in front of the door when you walk into the store, with the registers being immediately to the right of the door.

Now, the store *always* has some sort of coupon out. Usually it's a 40% off one regular priced item. If something is on sale already, the coupon doesn't work on it. 

So yesterday, this ornery looking lady comes to my register with a loom, about 15 packages of rubber band refills, and a handful of gewgaws from the clearance bins. There are one or two other small things that are regular price. She presents the 40% off coupon, and another 20% off the whole order. I scan all of her items and put them in the bag while she scrutinizes the screen on her side. When I get to the coupons, they only take a tiny amount off. When I tell her the total, this happens:

Ornery Lady: Why didn't you use my coupons?! That's way too much! I can't afford that!

Me: I did, but they don't work on things that are already on sale. It took the 40 and 20 off of your non-sale items. They were pretty cheap already, so it only took a few cents off.

OL: That's bullshit! This is totally illegal! It's false advertising! It doesn't say ANYWHERE that I can't use coupons for sale items! Give me my damn discount! I need these! 

Me: I'm sorry, but it does say right here on the coupon that sale items are excluded, and on a very large sign on the loom display itself that no additional coupons or discounts can be used on the loom stuff. And all of this other stuff is already on clearance.

OL: (shouting now) WHAT sign?! There's no sign! This is bullshit! You're trying to steal my money!

I calmly walk five feet over to the display and pick up the bright yellow sign that says ""No additional discounts may be applied to [loom] products"", and hold it up to show her.

 She visibly puffs up and bellows, ""You little bitch! I will NEVER shop here again! I spend a lot of money here! You just lost a VERY important customer!""

FredFltStn,202,,443,1nkw27,,1188,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

I've posted a few other stories [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/) if you're interested.

**STORY:**  I setup in a smaller city in Central Florida, and I go through the local police department to hire off duty officers for security when the tent is really busy. The officers love the duty shift, since it’s usually just getting paid to sit around and BS with my dad, eat my mom’s fantastic Cajun food (seriously, we now post a menu when we post the signup sheet), and make sure that any thief or idiot thinks twice before doing something stupid. I’m basically paying for peace of mind and to support local law enforcement, always a good idea if you’re a business owner.

Over the years, we’ve become good friends with several of the police officers, and it’s not uncommon for the Officer(s) on Duty to swing by and say hello. When they are working security for us, they are officially “off duty” with the city, but for a police officer, “off duty” is a relative term. They’re still in uniform and in communication via radio. Here are a few of the crazy things involving our “Security Detail” that have happened over the years.

**1.**  The officer was talking with a few customers when a call came over his radio. He jumped up, ran to his car, and peeled out of the parking lot. Someone had robbed the bank across the street and about a half block down from us. We can actually see the front door of the bank from inside the tent. The officer arrived at the bank just as the robber was taking off in his car. The officer forced him off the road and they busted him a few blocks away.

**2.**  I’m setup in the parking lot of a large shopping center. A manager from one of the businesses saw the police car parked by my tent, and walked over to complain to the officer about a van parked across the lot near his store. It was apparently abandoned there a week ago and was partially blocking one of the rows. When the officer walked over to investigate, he discovered the owner had OD’d inside the van a week ago. He spent the rest of the day overseeing the investigation and cleanup.

**3.**  I was running errands and passed by the tent when I saw three police cars and the Fire Marshall truck parked next to it. I panicked and did a U-turn so I could find out what was going on. Pulled into the parking lot like a maniac and rushed to the tent. Mom had made gumbo. There were two officers that that just gotten off duty and one of the on duty officers having lunch. The Fire Marshall had seen the police cars and stopped in to see what was up.  I needed a new pair of underwear.

**4.**  The officer was sitting a table with my dad having lunch when his radio went off. Bank Robbery! Same bank, 5 months later. The robber had already fled the scene when the call came through. Our officer left to help in the search. I think they caught the guy a couple of weeks later.

**5.**  A police officer we know stopped by one evening to let me know that someone had used a stolen credit card at my store that day. A woman couldn’t find her purse and had called the credit card company. The CC company gave her a list of charges that had been done that day on her card, and she contacted the police. It was a big purchase, around $750, and fortunately the cashier remembered the couple that had used the card. The Police took both of our statements.

Four days later, the couple walks into our tent again and starts to shop. The cashier immediately recognized them and grabbed me to let me know. We actually had an officer on site for security at the time, and I quietly let her know the thieves were back. She stepped out of the tent and called for backup on the radio. There were a couple dozen people shopping at the time, including 5 or 6 kids. I decided to demo a fountain in the parking lot, so we rounded up all the kids and had them leave the tent to go and watch. Four police officers swooped in and busted the couple. They didn’t put up a fight.

They found 12 stolen purses in their car and lots of merchandise, including my fireworks. I was one of several companies to press charges. They ended up taking a plea, and are still in prison as far as I know. 

To this day, I am still amazed that they had to balls to walk right past the police officer at our door after ripping me off a few days earlier.


**A quick follow up and vent by me...**

The stolen fireworks were seized as evidence. After the thieves took a plea deal (the day of the trial), ALL of the stolen merchandise, including the fireworks, were awarded by the judge to the families of the defendants.  That’s right…the judge gave all of the stolen merchandise to the families of the thieves. 

They had hit almost a dozen stores. I think they hit Wal-Mart for more than 5K, including gift cards. While we **LOVE** our local law enforcement, not really a big fan of the court system. I spent hours doing statements, interviews, and depositions. As a reward, I was ripped off again, this time by the court system.

Alphachicken,71,,308,1pulb0,,1187,"So a couple weeks ago I was working a solo evening shift at a sandwich shop in a local gas station. Its about 5pm and its been dead quiet all day so im just idly cleaning and watching for a rare potential customer. A guy comes in, and seemed like a really typical gas station customer kinda guy. Early 30's-ish, short, big, tattoos, iron maiden t-shirt, the works. 

He comes up and I take the first part of his order. I ask him how his day is going just to ease the silence while i'm working on his food. He says its goin' good and I put his sandwich in the oven. As I turn away from the oven and back to him he says ""Actually its goin damn great."" 

""Yeah?"" Im at least a little interested at this point, he didn't seem like a talkative man. 

""Yeah man, I met a girl a couple of days ago and weve really hit it off. Were all talkin and shit and she seems to like hanging out all the time."" 

As hes saying this he is slowly turning from perma-scowl to a weirdly boyish smile. He starts telling me about her hair and how she laughs all in a really surprisingly innocent way. I wrap up his food and start the register when he leans towards me with his hands out.

""The best part is, she has some just massive boobs,"" and holds his hands apart in front of him to demonstrate. 

At that point he looks at me and realizes hes telling the sandwich guy about his love life over a sandwich for the last five minutes. We both start laughing and I hand him his sandwich and tell him Im happy for him. He looks at me and apologizes saying ""Sorry man, I just feel awesome and I had to tell someone.""

However, for some inexplicable reason his prescription kept getting sent to the end of the line never to be filled. After about 30 minutes, he asks to speak to my boss and complains about it taking so long. It was one of the busiest pharmacies in Kansas City, but tons of people that came in after him were getting their meds and leaving. My boss calms him down by telling him that his script would be next and walks over to me and says, ""What's the deal here? Why do you keep moving his stuff to the back of the line?""

DocNifty,103,,344,1gnnaj,,1174,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Anyway, when I was in highschool I worked as a junior mechanic at a small garage in southern Maine. One day we had a guy call in and tell us he needed his clutch replaced. (I'll call him Screwguy). I was like ""no problem, man. Bring the car in at three and we'll get it done right quick"". So the guy brings his car in, and we start to raise it up on the lift. My boss looks at the undercarriage of the car and lets out this long whistle. Turns out Screwguy had (in his attempt to replace the clutch himself) removed literally every bolt and screw from the underside of his car. Every. Single. One. After digging around for about 5 minutes we determined that Screwguy had ruined his transmission with his overzealous bolt removal. When I break the news to him he goes dead pale. He just stares at me for a minute and then says ""my wife told me I was gonna break something... She's never gonna let me live this down"". I tell him the it's gonna cost about $900 to replace both the transmission and the clutch, and it's like a switch is flicked inside his head. ""$900, eh? I can do that... Yeah, that'll be fine. I'm gonna pay for all the work right now, in cash"". I'm just staring at Screwguy as he paces back and forth, gears in his head spinning like crazy. Suddenly he stops, and turns to me. ""Don't tell my wife"". He says looking me dead in the eyes. I just stare at him for a second before saying ""sure thing, man"". He shakes my hand as vigorously as is humanly possible before running, actually running, to the front of the store to pay for the work. When Screwguy and his wife come back later to pick up the car, he looks at his wife, then the car, and then he gives me this long slow wink. Like he's the smoothest criminal of all time. I almost spit my coffee half way across the room. Anyway, he got his car, drove off, and lived happily ever after. Not exactly a ""Tale from Retail"", but I thought you guys might enjoy it. 

EDIT: The guy brought in a clutch kit that he had purchased from another garage. Which is why the work was $900 instead of $1300. Sorry for any confusion or raised hopes of super cheap clutch/transmission replacements. Haha.",Don't Tell My Wife,1518,talesFromRetail
FredFltStn,122,,462,1qmc2g,,1169,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  In Florida, we get our fair share of rain, especially in the summer. During light showers, it’s business as usual, but when the wind and the rain really pick up, we batten down the hatches. We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped on.

One afternoon, we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind, rain, and lightning. It really came up on us fast, and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time. I grabbed all of my help, and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruined.

We managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage. We did however get totally soaked. 

while all of this was going on, my cashier was still ringing out customers, and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent. No offense, but in a lighting storm, **I** don’t even want to be in a tent in a parking lot.

Of course, that’s about the time we lost power. It was early afternoon, so we didn’t really need lights inside of the tent, and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), so they don’t cut out every time the power fails. 

My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door. About 30 minutes later, the power still hasn’t come back on, it’s still pouring outside, and the UPS’s give up the ghost and run out of juice.

Not a problem. I was a boy scout, and I have a backup plan for my backup plan. My parents RV has a generator, so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to. It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that, so I can’t just flip a switch and make it happen. but it's doable.

My dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch. While I’m out in the storm, one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tent.

At my counter, screaming at my cashier is uber bitch (UB). She’s pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase, just because the registers are dead. My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly, and they would ring her up as soon as possible, but UB didn’t want to hear about it.

This particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point, and her father is one of my best friends. She’d actually graduated high school, and was home from college on summer break, working for me. I always joke with her that she’s the boss, and I’m just there to do her bidding.

My cashier is keeping her cool, but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation. UB demands to check out **NOW**, because she has somewhere that she needs to be, and I need to take care of it.

I’m soaked to the bone, and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent, so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that. She actually had a pretty big purchase, and when I told her the total, she didn’t believe it. She wanted to see my phone to verify. She then went down the list of stuff, at least 30 items, and questioned each price. 

When she was doing this, she actually found a mistake I had made. I had entered in an item as $9.95 when it should have been $19.95. The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phone.

You should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her. I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her, and then gave her the new HIGHER total. I should mention that the entire time, there’s a crowd of people around watching the scene, and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happened.

When I told her the new total, she lost her GD mind. She started screaming at me that it was my fault, and that she shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake. In fact, she should get a discount for having to wait so long. I let her yell for a good two or three minutes, just standing there expressionless.

I’m tired, I’m soaked to the bone, and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch. I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf, then I turned to uber bitch and told her, “You’re going to need to go somewhere else, because you’re not allowed to shop here anymore.”

I turned to my cashier, in front of the customer, and told her, “Don’t sell that bitch anything.”

She left, screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rain.

**ONE YEAR LATER**


The same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent. It’s the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before, and she’s shopping with three or four other people. To be honest, even after seeing the lady, I didn’t place her face. If my cashier wouldn’t have recognized her, I’d have never noticed she was there.

**CASHIER:** What would you like me to do?

**ME:** It’s up to you. You’re the boss.

The lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout. When UB got to the register, my petite 20 year old female cashier stood her gound, looked her dead in the eye, and told her, “I’m sorry, you may have forgotten, but you’re not allowed to shop here.”

Stone. Cold. Baby.

The lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word. I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group. In the end, one of the people in the group paid for the stuff, and they walked out confused as hell.

Cerko,116,,284,1j65md,,1161,"I've only had this happen twice in the three years I've worked in fast food, yesterday and a couple months back.

Basically, one customer asked if he could pay for the car behind him at drive through.  Assuming he knew the next customer, I agreed and thought nothing of it.  When the next car got to the window, the woman attempted to pay, so I explained to her that the car in front of her already had.  She was confused, asking who they were or why they had done it.  Realizing that it wasn't someone she knew, I explained how once in a great while, someone will come through and offer to pay for the person behind them as a nice gesture.  The woman looked like she was about to cry, she had the biggest smile on her face.  After gushing over 'what a great person' they were for a bit, she asked if she could do the same for the car behind her.

The 'pay it forward' line lasted for the rest of the cars in drive through, about 9 people payed for the person behind them.  Some of the orders were double the price of theirs, yet no one hesitated to pay it.

It made he rest of my night, just wanted to share with you guys :)

EDIT: For those of you asking, the 9th car was the last in line, so he had no one to pay for.  Before paying he actually offered, but glanced behind him and realized no one was there.

kaithekender,148,,247,1dxito,,1152,"About a year ago I started working at a large retail chain. The particular location I was employed at was going through a lot of changes in management, procedures, and the like. Basically, the store was in a shambles logistically and couldn't keep employees for more than a month or two at best.

Beyond the usual age verification for certain items, there was no standard procedure followed by anybody with regards to people purchasing tobacco, lottery, or basically any high-value items that had to be stored behind the counter. We would take the items, scan them, and put them on the counter while the customer paid for them. Didn't have any issues.

One day we had a loss prevention guy come in and observe our security procedures. One of his ""suggestions"" was that when making these kind of sales, we do not place them in reach of the customers until they are paid for in full. Okay, seems reasonable. Nobody should have a problem with this unless they actually plan to steal shit, right?

Not so. From the time we implemented the measure, there was ONE GUY, a regular, who came in to buy cigarettes every day, and he had a huge problem with this.

""Where are my cigarettes?""

""They're here behind the counter, sir.""

""Well why aren't they in my hand yet?""

""Because you have not yet paid for them, sir. We have new security measures in place to prevent potential losses.""

""So you think I'm going to steal them?""

""No sir.""

""Well then put them in my fucking hand!""

""No sir, that would breach proper procedure. I don't think you're going to steal them, but this is the rule and it will be followed.""

""I don't care what the rule is, you have no right to treat me like a criminal! Now put the smokes in my hand or I'm going to talk to your manager!""

""Okay sir, I'll call him from the back.""

So I rang the button that ding-donged the backroom, and an assistant manager came out and asked what was going on. They talked for a while and decided that I would place the cigarettes in his hand, breaching procedure and making me look like an asshole.

So I did. And the guy smirks at me and says ""There, was that so hard? At least your managers are competent. Maybe you should get a job cleaning toilets or something, seems more your speed."" Right in front of my manager.

At this point I looked at my manager and said ""Hey *Mike, did you hear what he just said to me? That was an abusive comment, and I'm not going to take it.""

I told him to hand back the cigarettes and get out of the store, but he refused.

""You put them in my hand, they're mine now. take my money or don't, they're mine.""

So I looked at my manager and said ""This is what happens when you don't follow procedure and make me look like an idiot, Mike. This is your problem now, I quit.""

And I walked out. Abusive customers suck, and managers who abide them are worse.

EDIT: Guys, don't downvote people just for *respectfully* suggesting that I could have done things differently. If somebody's being an asshole and lobbing insults, fine. But there's a comment from MrJigglyBrown buried down there that I don't feel warrants the negative attention it's receiving. He seems like an OK guy :(","""I'M NOT A CRIMINAL!""",1399,talesFromRetail
halo00to14,244,,274,1f3mat,,1159,"To start off, these are going to be a short series of stories that I've stored from my time working at an law enforcement officer (LEO) retail store. Despite the title, it's by no means meant to be political argument for or against guns. It's just... well, you'll see. And sorry for the length.

I did a post about this store called [You think you had a bad day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ejoer/you_think_you_had_a_bad_day/). Anyways, onto the stories!

**First Experiences**

Before starting working where I work now, I only had limited experience with guns, firearms, weapons, etc. I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter. One of the people training me, laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed. These rules are:

1) The weapon is always loaded.

2) Even when you know the weapon is unloaded. It's always loaded.

3) Always point the weapon at a safe direction. Never at someone. See rules 1 and 2 for why.

4) When handing a weapon over to someone, make sure the slide/bolt is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that it's cleared.

5) When a weapon is handed to you, always clear it. See rules 1 and 2.

6) Never point a firearm at something that you don't intend to kill. There is no such thing as shooting to injure.

7) Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at.

I also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon. People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall. I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2 (notice a theme?). Most people will drop sight line, raise the weapon's barrel to point at the ceiling, lower the weapon down, etc to let me pass. Cool, no problem.

My first day behind the gun counter, and the first customer I had behind there wanted to see a Glock 17. I remove the weapon from the case, clear it, locked the slide back, handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands. Problem? He was pointing it right at me. I moved to the side to get out of the line of ""fire"" and he followed me.

""Sir, could you please not point the weapon at me?""

""Why, it's not loaded?""

""I don't care, please don't point the weapon at me.""

""Stop being such a...""

At this point, a co-worker who's been there for 10+ years reaches out, grabs the slide from the top, breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave.

""Why do I have to leave?""

""Because you aren't being safe with the weapon. You need to leave now.""

""Fuck you. I want to see a manager.""

Fine. My coworker calls out a name. Down at the other end of the counter, is the president of the company. The name called was his. My coworker tells the president what just happened, including the ""fuck you"" part, the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me. ""Yes sir."" asked the customer if he did point the gun at me, ""Yeah, but it was unloaded."" The president looks at the guy and says matter of factly,""Get the fuck out of my store and don't come back.""

The guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it, saying that he shouldn't be talking to a customer that way, which was meet with a reply of ""you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees."" The guy wasn't moving and was getting more and more angry. Since we are cater to LEO and military, we usually have a sheriff, police officer, constable, state police, federal agent in store. The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that there's five officers looking at him, ready to take him out of the store and to downtown/jail if he doesn't leave now.

Officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting. I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk's ass.

""Fine! I'm never coming here again!"" The customer said.

""I know and I don't care,"" the big boss said.

**Yes, we accept trades!**

After a while, you get to feel for how heavy a weapon is unloaded, and can tell when it is loaded, even if you never held a loaded weapon before. There's a certain weight to it and the balance is different.

So, we take trades. This guy comes in looking to trade his shotgun for credit to get a different shotgun. No biggie. We do this all the time. We tell him to bring in the weapon, and make sure it's cleared. He brings in the shotgun, and hands it to me. It felt... different. Heavier.

""Are you sure this is cleared?""

""Yeah, I cleared it before I put it in the car.""

So most of you know, it's not very smart to carry a loaded shotgun in a car/truck or have one in the chamber because it can accidentally discharge. Shotguns don't usually have a drop safety and some hard bumps can make the hammer strike the shell causing an accidental discharge. It's illegal, at least in my state, to have a loaded shotgun in the vehicle for these reasons.

I rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead. I follow the shell in flight, in slow motion as I see it hit him in the head, thinking ""What the fuck man!?""

I rack it six more times.

Six more shells go flying out.

He is told to put the shells back in his car and we'll finish the trade when he comes back in. He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers.

**I need a holster**

We sell anything an officer needs; duty gear, pants, holsters, accessories for their weapons, badges, vehicle equipment, you name it, we have it or can get it. So a local officer comes in and needs a holster.

""We can help you with a holster. What weapon do you have?""

""I don't know.""

This happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying. If my sample size is any indication about other officers, a good 85-90% don't know what side arm they carry. We ask if he has it with him, he says yes, and we tell him to clear the weapon, lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster.

He comes back in with a weapon, ""cleared."" We see that it's a common weapon, and we have different holsters for it and show him the holsters. As he is looking at the holster, someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon. He drops the slide, which chambers a round. The gun is now hot, live and ready to shoot. Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster. The weapon is stuck.

Fuck us, a loaded gun is stuck in a holster. Coworker gets that look of slight panic, I grab the weapon and holster from the customer, drop the magazine, and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor. I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out, but it's gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others, he's not allowed in there. I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is.

He's cool with this, and does feel very stupid. I'm can't really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safe.

So, I take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely. I call in two other, more experience co-workers to help figure this out. After some cussing, grumbling, lots of WD-40, and talk about taking a saw to the holster, we finally got it free.

The next day, everyone got a lecture and retaining on weapon safety.

**I'm on the SWAT team**

People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Sheriffs, at least in my part of the woods, tend to be on the bigger size of things.

This big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT rig/uniform. He has a purchase order from his department. He needs everything, new body armor, clothing, thigh rig, chest holster, sling for the AR he has to get, new duty belt rig, the whole nine.

The problem? We didn't have anything that fit him.

We can measure for body armor as those are custom made. But the sheet measurements didn't go that big.

Pants? We didn't have anything close to his size. I had to take a measuring tape, or two, to get the guys waist size. We had to order a 6XL. For frame of reference, I'm a size 30 waist. When these pants finally came in, myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people.

Of course, he was offended that everything had to be custom made, that we didn't have it in stock, and would be up charged for the size, which, the department PO didn't take into account.

The horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield. I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door, have him scream ""OH YEAH!""

Alright, I think this is long enough. I have other stories that I'll share at a later time. Enjoy!

levirain,214,,328,1lt4ny,,1151,"Up until recently, I worked at a fairly small Garden/Floral/Gift store in Minnesota. There are 7 of these stores, all of which are in Minnesota.
Now I had been working at this store for about 4 years, so I know the ropes around this place. When we are short staffed, or no manager can be found, I act as supervisor/manager.


This story was actually one of the reasons I left my job there, straw that broke the camel's back or what have you. It was a Sunday, about a week or so ago. Here in MN, it was gross out: hot, muggy, humid. Gross. I was working the Customer Service and Information desks, it was a little more than an hour and a half before we close, so I was tidying up the areas, and just keeping busy since there was really nothing else to do.


I hear the door open, and look over. A lady had walked in, and boy did she look upset.

She marches over to me, and I prepare for the worst.
She begins to inform me that she has been sitting in the parking lot for 30 minutes, waiting.
I question her as to what she was waiting for.


lady:""SOME BIMBO LEFT HER GODDAMN DOGS IN HER CAR""
She shouts this, probably hoping to get the person's attention.

I have her take me outside and show me.

Sure enough, 2 chihuahuas are in a black car on this 90+ degree and humid as fuck day, windows up, no water visable.

I walkie the one manager working today, with no reply. I bring the lady inside, and have her sit in the office while I flag our stock guy down and call the police.

Our stock boy comes up in a hurry as I am giving our address to the police, I hand him a hammer, and tell him to wait for my word to break the window.

I hang up with the police, get on the overhead and ask for the owner of the car to come to Customer Service. I wait 2 minutes before getting on my walkie to say ""-Manager-, -Stock- is breaking the customers window, police are on their way""

Seconds after I walkie this, I see a lady and my manager running up to my counter.

bimbo:""THAT IS MY F---ING CAR, DONT YOU F---ING DARE BREAK MY WINDOW""
-Stock- Walks in with the two dogs
Bimbo:""WHY THE HE-- DOES HE HAVE MY F---ING DOGS? THERE WAS WATER IN MY CAR, THEY WERE FINE. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO BREAK MY WINDOW, I AM GOING TO SUE YOU.

Manager and Bimbo stare at me blankly.

Me:""The police are on their way""

Bimbo:""....Well I am just going to take my dogs and go. Like they can find me""

Me:""Do you really think I am seriously going to let you take those dogs? Go ahead and leave, you have a f---ing busted out window, and the police have your license plate number, not going to be to hard to find you""

Bimbo:""WHAT?! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!""

Me:""I gave you a chance to come up. Maybe if you didn't want me to call the police, you shouldn't have left your dogs in your car""

Bimbo rushes out.

jessbakescakes,140,,227,1g32dd,,1151,"So, we've all had the parents come into our workplace, and let their kids run wild/destroy the store/treat employees like crap. I once had a parent dump a kid's piggy bank on the counter and sit and laugh while I counted out all the change. But, today, I had a good experience with a parent and wanted to share.

The little kid was about 5-6 years old and had clearly been saving for this toy for awhile. He had his money all wadded up in his hand... like, crumbled and stuff. His mom caught it as he was handing it to me, and she crouched down to his level.

Mom: Now, look at what you're about to give her. What would you think if someone gave that to you? Would that be very nice?

The little boy looked at his hand and kind of shrugged. 

Mom: Let's unfold this and count it out. When you buy something, you always hand the nice lady or man your money the way you'd want your money handed to you. So, that means you count it out, and you unfold it, and you put it in their hand and not on the counter. You wouldn't like it if someone just dropped it in front of you, so that's how we treat other people.

I basically wanted to hug this mom. It took her kid an extra minute or so to un-wad his bills, but the gesture was so nice. I love when parents teach their kids some respect and courtesy... it's so rare sometimes, and it just really warms my heart when they do.",A thank you to the awesome parents.,1378,talesFromRetail

Years ago I was attending a local college learning computer repair and networking. A guy in my class, who was known for being a braggart, worked part-time at a big box store that serviced and sold computers. He came in one day bragging about his new processor and how much faster his computer ran now. He was just dying to tell us how he'd out-smarted a different big box store and come out of it with a free processor.

He told us how he'd gone into the store and bought a brand new processor. He took it home, installed it in his computer, and put his old one back in the box. He then returned it to the store and got his money back, claiming it was defective.

Of course, this is clearly theft, and it made all of us uncomfortable to hear about, and the instructor shook his head sadly at him.

The next day he didn't show up for class. Neither did he show up the second day. On the third day he came back, and was raging mad that things were unfair. He told us he'd taken the two days off to cool down because he was so angry at what had happened to him.

It turns out that in addition to bragging to us, he'd also bragged to all his coworkers at the big box store. He thought they'd love his story, because he'd done the stealing from a competitor.

His boss was disgusted by his actions, and phoned up the store he'd ripped off and told them what he'd done. He told them that the thief would be coming in and returning the real processor, and gave them the guy's full name and phone number in case he skipped out on it. The braggart was afraid of losing his job at this point, so he manned up and took back what he'd stolen. As soon as his boss had confirmation that things had been put right, he fired the guy.

I really like to think that the guy learned something from the whole ordeal, but the way he was raging about how unfairly he'd been treated, I doubt it.

Drunken_Black_Belt,211,,287,19l4ki,,1150,"So here's a quick one that just happened to me on my lunch break.  Went down the road to get a sammich, and decided to stop for gas.As I'm putting the nozzle into the tank, a Mercedes pulls up behind me.  We were the only two people at the pumps, and I didn't think much of it at the time.  After about 30 seconds, the Mercedes issues a short, loud honk.  Ok, maybe the driver leaned on the horn by accident while getting composed to step out into the cold. No big deal.

10 seconds later, 2 more honks in quick succession.  Ok.... dafuq?  So I turn and look and the driver is waving me over to her.  Umm alright.  So I shimmy on over, and the drivers side window rolls down. Inside is what I can only describe to be a reject from the Real Housewives of NJ.  Orange skins still glowing from her last session in a tanning bed.  Lips are so inflated and puffed up, I wonder if she either has had too many colagen injections, or if she's perhaps dating Chris Brown.  Designer purse and sunglasses.  The only thing missing would be a Gucci dog carrier with a small pomeranian inside.  

Anyways, the woman extends her hand, full of money, and tells me ""Thirty Dollars"".  At this point, as I've only gotten two hours of sleep, I'm still not grasping what the fuck is truly going on here. My normally sharp intellect is now moving at the same pace as Kristy Alley running a marathon after her 3rd mile.

Me: I'm sorry, whats the problem?

HouseWife:  I want $30 put into the tank.

I decided at this time to look down at myself, and make sure that I was in fact wearing my work uniform.  And just as I suspected all along, I am wearing dress pants, shoes, a white button down shirt, and nice heavy sweater with a nice bright white patch on it that says *SECURITY COMPANY NAME SECURITY* on it.  

Me: Ummm ma'm I don't work here.

HW: What? You don't?

Me: Noooo.  See this right here. It says Security.  

HW: Well then wheres the attendant? Why isn't he pumping your gas?

Me:  He's inside I guess. And it's not full service.

HW: What? YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PUMP MY OWN GAS?

Me: Well, yes it's self service.

HW: Well, this is NOT how it is in NJ.

Me:  Yea well this is not NJ, so don't know what you were expecting.

HW: Where's the nearest self serve station.

Me: Far as I know, about 4 towns north.

Hw: Well can't you just pump my gas?

Me:uhhh... no.

Hw: Why not?

At this point I just walked away.  Stupidity is infectious and I don't wanna catch a case of the HerpDerps.  The HW, clearly pissed off, actually had to get out of her car. Can you believe it. How dare I?  She storms into the convenience store and starts berating the clerk.  Now at this point my gas is done pumping, but much like a porno after you've already finished, I HAD to sit tight and watch the final shot.

The clerk, visibly confused, is listening to this woman, as she is pointing to me, clearly yelling.  The clerk stares at me, blinks a few times, and turns back to the woman.  I can see him shake his head.  This obviously upsets HW even further.  I can see her ranting and raving and the clerk, great guy that he is, stands his ground and tells her she can either pump her own gas or go somewhere else.  Well HW comes out, walks over to the gas pump, and sits there.  She obviously can't figure out how to work the damn thing.  I walk in grab my receipt, share a quick laugh with the cashier, and walk back to my car.  As I'm walking over, HW waves and says ""Sweetie, could you show me how to work this! Be a doll.""

My laughter could be heard for miles from that one.  I got back into my car, put on Jump by Van Halen, and laughed my way back to work.

FredFltStn,302,,459,1q3l7r,,1142,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks. The customer was hearing-impaired, and the call was being conducted through a TDD device using an operator. If you've never communicated over a TDD through an operator, it can be exasperating, and I feel terrible for the hearing impaired people who have to use one.

Basically, you tell the operator whatever you’d like to say, making sure to speak slowly. The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard, and then sends it to the hearing impaired user. The user then reads the message, types in their reply, and sends it back to the operator. The operator then reads the reply back to you. 

Sometimes, it can take minute or two for all this to happen, so you’re basically saying a couple of sentences or asking a question, waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply, and then speaking again. It's like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the moon.

Apparently, the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in June, and was mad because some of them didn't work.  I give an unconditional money back guarantee on everything I sell, and I always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuff.

I apologized profusely, and since my store is seasonal and had already closed, I offered to send him a check to refund his purchase. 

Normally, I’d want to see a receipt or have them bring back the duds, but because of the TDD, we’d already been on the phone for more than 20 minutes at that point. I felt bad for the guy, and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy. 

**(Two minutes later - TDD delay)** Unfortunately, that wasn't the answer he was looking for. Instead, he wanted me to replace his fireworks. I offered to meet him somewhere and bring him replacements.

**(Two minutes later)** I was informed that he lived an hour away and couldn’t get over to Orlando. Instead, he wanted me to mail him the fireworks.

Now fireworks are considered hazardous materials, and can't be shipped through the regular mail. Because of the expense and problems associated with this, I don't ship fireworks. I let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the duds.

**(Two minutes later)** I was again told that I needed to mail him fireworks, since I had a guarantee, and the fireworks he had purchased were bad. Once again, I explained to the operator that I didn’t mail fireworks, but that I’d be happy to send a check. 

**(Two minutes later)** He’s now really mad at me, and yelling that I can send him a check and he’ll go to another fireworks company to get his stuff. I only know that he was yelling because the TDD operator informed me that he was typing “emphatically”.

That’s right…I was being yelled at by a hearing impaired person over the phone through an operator translating the call.

I asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were duds, so I could figure out the cost and mail him a check. I also told him that I would need his home address.

**(Two minutes later)** It’s a box of firecrackers. A F*cking $9.95 box of firecrackers. I had now spent 30 minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that “some of the firecrackers” in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased them.

I immediately sent him a check for $20 through online banking. I filled out the note field on the check. It read, “Please shop somewhere else”. Unfortunately, it can take up to 8 days for the check to arrive when it’s a new entry online.

The bastard called me back every day until he got the check. When the TDD operator would identify themselves, I would just say, “The check is in the mail”, and hang up.

nakedinthepond,84,,300,1oirl1,,1145,"Hey TFR! I worked at a well known pet supply chain, and this is one of the few good stories that I have to tell. 

So, one of our regular customers was an elderly lady, who happened to be the mother of a severely autistic young man, we'll call him Johnny. Johnny was well known in the store for having meltdowns, where he would just sit down on the floor, curl up into a tight ball, and refuse to move. He never got violent, he just sat, and sometimes cried. 

I loved Johnny. He was the sweetest thing, and his mother was always so kind. On this particular day, I was working customer service, so I was running around, doing price checks, carry outs, etc. I was standing at the front, waiting on a woman (NL for Nice Lady) to finish paying so that I could help her out to her car. Enter Johnny and his mom. 

They walk through our first set of sliding doors, no problem, but Johnny is a little distracted by this DVD he has in his hands. He then proceeds to sit down in the middle of our second set of sliding doors, blocking the way. His mom is doing everything she can to move Johnny, but he just won't budge! He is so enthralled by the DVD in his hands that he has completely shut down to everyone. 

I see Johnny doing this, and I also see the massive line of people trying to get out the front door, but with a cart there is just no way around him. I politely tell NL that I will help her carry out her groceries, if she will give me just a minute to handle the situation. She smiles politely and says no problem, so I head over to the doors. 

I sat down next to Johnny, and I got tons of death glares from the angry pet parents trying so desperately to leave the store. 

**Me**- Hey Johnny! Whatcha got there? Is that a new DVD?

**Johnny**- I LOVE LUCY! 

**Me**- Oh my gosh! I love Lucy too! Did your mom buy you that new I Love Lucy movie?

**Johnny**- Mhm. I love Lucy.

**Me**- You know what? So do I. But hey! I have some awesome news for you!

Johnny just kind of stared at the DVD packaging.

**Me**- We got some new cats in the adoption center! Why don't you ask your mom if you can go look at them? They are super cute, and one of them will even lick your hand!

At this point, Johnny's face absolutely lights up, and he got the biggest smile on his face. He didn't say anything, but he just hopped up and ran over to his mom, who in turn gave me the biggest, most exhausted smile I have ever seen. She nodded her head in thanks, then went about her shopping, with a happy Johnny in tow. 

NL, apparently, had watched the whole situation go down. As I was helping her out to her car, she couldn't stop commending me for how I handled the situation. After I finished unloading her groceries, she tried to tip me $5! I was so surprised that I almost started crying, but I just told her very politely that I couldn't accept tips, but thank you so much for the kindness. 

That was the best day I think I might have ever had, working at that stupid pet store.

I went away for vacation and when I came back, boy was there gossip. ""Greg,"" one of the friendliest and most helpful employees, had been fired. Funny thing was, Greg had *also* been on vacation, out of state for a family reunion.  He came back into our shop a couple months later and I got the whole story.

You see, the store manager next door was Boss' Son. Like many beneficiaries of nepotism, he practically got away with murder. Showing up late or not showing up for shifts, opening shop late, disappearing for half the day, ""borrowing"" things for his rec softball team, all that good stuff. BS also had a habit of calling his employees to cover shifts at the last minute -- an hour or less of lead time.

Greg, as I mentioned, had his vacation approved in advance, all the paperwork in order, tickets purchased, bags packed, everything was gravy. The day he's set to fly out, he gets a text from BS telling him he needs to get to the shop ASAP to cover BS's shift. (Not that BS was sick or had some important business function to perform. He just had a date.) No can do, obviously -- Greg isn't going to reschedule a flight at the last minute just to cover BS's ass. So Greg texts back and tells him that since the vacation was approved by BS himself as of two months ago, he won't be coming in.

BS, being the mature and responsible manager he is, sucks it up and covers the shift himself.

... hahaha, just kidding. No. He fires Greg via text, instead. 

Greg, he takes it in stride. Goes on vacation, gets back, and instead of heading to work, heads right to the unemployment office to file a claim for wrongful dismissal, paperwork and copies of texts in hand. Then he goes to a friend who worked for the city and gets a much more lucrative and rewarding job, same day.

Nice thing was, when all was said and done, he won his suit for wrongful dismissal, and *still got awarded monthly unemployment payments despite already having another job*. Apparently, in this state the unemployment office does a routine conference call with employees and employers when verifying claims, just to get both sides of the story at once.

Hey all,

This is a story from many years ago back when I used to work at a electronics / computer / appliance / media retailer. Sorry it's so long. I get verbose sometimes.

The backstory:

Apparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator. They found a couple they liked for something around $1000. They picked one, and paid for it on their credit card. They set it up to be delivered some time a few days later. No real issues at this point.

The next day the woman came back in. They decided they had changed their minds, and didn't want that specific refrigerator anymore, and wanted to think about switching to the other one they liked instead. No problem. Delivery was canceled.

This is where the core problem occurred: She neglected to bring the credit card (presumably her husband's) they had originally paid with back in. At this time (I don't know if it's different now... I haven't worked there in over a decade), we could only process a credit card return if we had the original card to put the money back on. She didn't have it, and they lived an hour away.

A manager was called over. This manager told the woman (in front of two different customer service reps) that, because she didn't have the credit card, we could only process the return for store credit (unless, of course, she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card). The woman was not happy about this, but agreed, since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anyway.

As the manager was processing the return, he very specifically said something along the lines of, ""Just so you know, after the close of business today, we will no longer be able to undo this transaction. You will be stuck with the store credit and there's absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card, give it back to you in cash, etc. If you want the money back on the credit card, you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day, and then we have a way we'll be able to put the money back on the card. After the close of business though, there's literally nothing we can do to get the money back on the card.""

The woman acknowledged this, accepted the store credit voucher, and went on her way.

Now, here's where I come in:

The next day, I'm working Loss Prevention for the store, standing at the front, checking receipts, monitoring cameras, etc. Nothing out of the usual was happening, when all of a sudden I hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk. A woman is yelling at one of the customer service representatives something along the lines of ""You guys are thieves! Give me back my money!"" It was the woman from the day before. At this point, I have no idea what the situation is, though.

I ask someone to cover the desk for me, and head over to see what is going on. The manager who had helped her out the day before happened to be there. He arrived at customer service desk at the same time I did.

Apparently when her husband got home from work that night (after we had already closed), he informed her that he had already purchased another refrigerator from one of our competitors, assuming she would be able to handle the return of the one they had purchased from us. She informed him of the store credit situation, and he got pissed. She was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible. 

The manager did what he could to calm the woman down. She was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money, etc. The manager reminded the woman of the conversation they had the day before. Of course, she accused the manager of lying and said he never told her anything like that. However, he had witnesses, and in addition, that exact policy was spelled out in plain English on both her receipt, and the wall right next to her. It was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone. At this point, she had $1000 store credit, and you can't return store credit. He apologized, but said there was nothing he could do, and asked her to step aside if she didn't have any other business.

She stepped aside, but then just started swearing at every customer as they approached the customer service desk. ""Don't fucking buy anything from these assholes. They will steal your fucking money."" At the point, I had to ask her to leave as she was causing a disturbance. She complied, but on her way out yelled, ""I am calling my husband. Wait until he gets here. You fuckers will all pay.""

Fast forward a few hours, and in storms the most irate looking man I've ever seen in my life. Face beet red... fists clenched... looking like he's ready to punch the first person who says a word to him. He's not a big dude or anything... but he. looks. pissed. He storms up to me and (to his credit), quite calmly says, ""Please point me towards customer service."" I point. He heads off that way.

I know there's going to be trouble at this point, so I call back to the warehouse and ask for the biggest guys back there to come up to the front. I lucked out. We had a guy back there who was about 6'4"" probably 400 lbs and another who was about 6'1"" 250. At this point, I was about 6'1"" and maybe 180. Together, we were a formidable enough force that I figured we'd be able to handle whatever happened. I got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer service.

By the time I get there, the dude is already screaming his ass off at some poor 19 year old customer service rep, who is desperately trying to get anyone's attention to come help her. The manager gets there just as I do, again, and tries to calm the man down. The man isn't hearing a word of it, though. He throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service reps face and says ""If that money doesn't get back on that card in the next two minutes, something bad is going to happen."" Well, he was right.

I approach the man from behind, and I see the two guys from the warehouse jogging up. The manager says, ""Sir, your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return. There's literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for you.""

The man replies, ""Bullshit. You guys can do it. And you will do it.""

My manager, ""Sir, I assure you we literally can't. The system won't allow it. There's nothing we can do. You need to leave.""

The man says, ""No. Fuck that. I'm not leaving until I get my money. I don't care how. Pull $1000 cash out of the drawer. I don't care. Give me my fucking money.""

My manager says, ""Sir, we can't help you. The corporate number is on your original receipt. Maybe they can do something. We can't do it here. You need to calm down and leave the premises now.""

The guy says, ""I'm not going anywhere. Fuck you.""

Manager says, ""I have now asked you to leave. If you don't leave the premises in the next 10 seconds, I'm calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing.""

The guy responds, ""Fuck you. Call them. I don't give a fuck.""

So the manager picks up the phone and starts dialing. Meanwhile, the dude starts screaming at the customer service rep again, who just looks like a deer in headlights. I say firmly, ""Sir, you have been asked to leave. You are trespassing. It is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worse.""

This apparently startled him. He didn't know I was there. He quickly turns and swings at me. Luckily for me, the dude was off balance and threw a terrible punch, so I was able to dodge out of the way of it. I charge him and slam him into the customer service desk. The other two dudes from the warehouse jump in and we wrestle the guy to the ground, where the 400 lbs dude just holds him down.

The guy hilariously squirms and flails beneath the weight of this huge guy, swearing up a storm, ""Ah fuck you get off me fuck you pieces of shit... fucking assholes!"" This lasted for a couple of minutes. After realizing he's not nearly strong enough to get out of the situation, he starts to calm down and bargain. ""Okay, okay... you're right... I should just go. Just let me up and I'll leave calmly.""

My manager, having gotten off the phone with the police at this point, says, ""We gave you plenty of chances for that. You decided not to go. At this point, you assaulted one of my employees, and you are going to go to jail.""

And went to jail he did. He was charged with battery (for throwing the cards in the customer service rep's face), assault (for verbal threats such as ""something bad is going to happen"" and swinging at me), and trespassing (failing to leave the premises when ordered). He plead guilty across the board. I never heard what his sentence was.

FredFltStn,175,,469,1o26jb,,1123,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  I got a phone call from a guy asking about our selection of fireworks. He said he and his friends were putting on a little show, and they were looking to pick up some good stuff. We have a lot of customers that do the same thing. They’ll get together with friends or have a block party, everyone will throw in some cash, and they’ll put on their own show. I explained how we had everything they needed, as well as videos of all the fireworks. The guy says thanks and hangs up.

A few hours later, three guys in their early 30’s walked in and asked for me. They looked pretty ragged, with scraggly beards and camo pants, but then again, I’m selling explosives out of a tent in a parking lot. I started showing them videos of our stuff, and explained different effects and ways to put on a good show. One of the guys asked for paper and a pen, and would periodically scribble on the clipboard we gave him. 

This went on for at least an HOUR! I don't think the three of them combined said more than 50 words the entire time. Afterward, one of them told me thank you, and they walked out the door.  It was pretty slow that day, so guess it wasn’t really a waste of my time, but I was still a little weirded out by their behavior.

**Guess who walks back through the door an hour later…**

I was actually helping someone else at the time, so my dad went to take care of them. It was like déjà vu. They spent ANOTHER HOUR walking around, watching videos, then out the door again.

**Guess who walks back through the door an hour later…**

I didn’t actually see them come in, but one of them walked past me carrying something in his hands while I was helping another customer. I’m trying to pay attention to the person I’m helping, but I can see these guys all walking around with their arms full, and I’m wondering what the hell is going on. I excuse myself and head to the front of the store.

When I get to the front, I’m greeted by a replica of the Great Wall of China made entirely of fireworks. These guys are grabbing 2, sometimes 3 or 4 of each item, and recreating one of the great wonders of the world at the front of my store. I’m trying to help them, but I swear to God, these guys still aren’t saying 10 words to me.

When the dust settles, my store looks like it’s been ransacked. I’m pretty sure they grabbed at least one or two of damn near everything I sell. I honestly had two different cashiers ring them up on two registers at the same time, just to get through the mountain of stuff. We swapped out multiple pieces with full cases where we could.

The entire time, the trio is just standing around watching us ring it and box it. No small talk, no chatter. When I had to ask them a question, I’d get a one or two word reply. When we finished, I let them know that I appreciated their business, and since they had purchased so much, I was going to give them a substantial discount. To put it in perspective, the DISCOUNT was more than $1000!  No smile, no high five, no victory dance. Just looked and me with a blank stare, said thanks, and paid in cash.

The story should end there…but it doesn’t.

One of the three leaves, and pulls around in an old cargo van. It has bucket seats for both the driver and the passenger, and a bench seat for the third guy. Immediately I realize that there’s no way in hell they’re going to fit all of the fireworks in the van. I went to offer assistance, but they of course said no thanks. At this point, I think my entire staff was standing outside of the tent, watching the 3 of them play fireworks Tetris.

After about 15 minutes, I think they caught on that it wasn’t all going to fit. The solution…remove the bench seat. They asked if they could leave it and pick it up later, and I happily said yes. They finally get it loaded, and I mean this thing is stuffed to the gills. They had stacked the fireworks to the ceiling in back, but had actually left a little space between the fireworks and the roof just behind the two bucket seats.

When they go to leave, all three of them climb in the van. The driver in the driver’s seat, the passenger in the passenger’s seat, and the third person **LAYING ON TOP OF THE CASES OF FIREWORKS**. As they drove away, my dad summed it up perfectly.

**DAD:**  If they get into a car accident on the way home, the police aren’t going to find anything left of them bigger than a quarter.

caticorns,99,,293,1jpcwx,,1118,"Hello, TFR! My last story really had nothing to do with my job specifically, but this one, oh this one...Just happened a few hours ago, and I'll write it while it's fresh on my mind.

As I stated in my previous tale, I work in the deli department of the big-box retailer in my town. We do specialty trays, vegetable, sandwich, you name it - we do it. Now, all trays, no matter hot or cold, we ask for at least 24 hours notice on orders, so we can prepare the next day's crew, and get the cold trays for the next day out of the way. 

Now, onto the story.

Yesterday, I took a lady's order over the phone for a cubed cheese tray (let's call the lady Entitled Twatwaffle, or **ET** for short. Now, ET was polite while I was taking her order, very specific in what she wanted, and was very grateful for taking her order and repeating it as we went along in our conversation. Seemed like a nice enough lady, assumed she'd be an easy customer.

Fast forward to today. It was around 2 PM, I was ready to go to lunch, it'd been a long day (tax-free weekend, and the last day of summer vacation here). The phone rings. My coworkers were swamped with customers, so I quickly answered. The conversation goes as follows:

Me: Thank you for calling the [redacted] deli, how may I help you today?

ET: Hi, I called for a tray yesterday, and I was supposed to pick it up earlier, and I'm running a bit late.

Me: Oh, okay! What was the name on the order?

ET: Twatwaffle.

Me: Ah, yes, you ordered our cubed cheese tray, correct?

ET: Yes, ma'am. 

Me: Okay, well what can I do for you?

ET: Well, I'm running a bit behind today, and I'm on my way there right now, I was wondering if there was any way you could take my tray to the customer service desk so I can just pay for it and go. 

**NOTE**: This wasn't a problem. Our deli is in the VERY BACK of our store, and I honestly didn't feel any issue with running an order to the front for a customer.

Me: Yes ma'am I can do that for you! If you will just call us when you arrive, I, or someone else, can meet you at the service desk with your tray!

ET: Oh, well I was also going to see if you could pick up two cases of bottled water, the store brand, my balloons from the produce department, OH, and two medium sized watermelons on your way. 

Me: ...excuse me?

ET: Well, I mean, you're going to pass ALL THOSE THINGS on your way to the service desk, you might as well.

Me: Well, ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't do your shopping for you.

ET: UGH. WELL YOU'RE BRINGING MY TRAY UP, YOU MIGHT AS WELL.

Me: (at this point, I'm grimacing and mouthing to my friend/coworker that I'm going to kill myself) Ma'am, I apologize, but we're extremely swamped and shorthanded as it is, and I'm doing you a huge favor just taking your tray up front, I really don't want to take much more time than I can. 

At this point, my manager can hear the frustration in my voice. She stands beside me as I'm arguing with this insufferable asshat. 

ET: You're inconveniencing me! I don't have time to walk all over the store for those things! I need to speak to your manager right now, young lady!

I hand the phone over to my manager. Now, my manager is a no-nonsense lady. She's yelled at customers for being rude to us before, so I have no doubt in my mind this situation will be the same. I'll call her Badass Manager, or **BM** for short.

BM: This is the BM, deli manager, how may I help you?

All I can hear is yelling through the earpiece, I heard a few ""stupid""s and ""rude""s in the mixture. Maybe a ""lazy"" or two. 

BM: Ma'am, my employees are NOT your personal shoppers. Now, unless you are disabled, my employees have NO reason to do your shopping for you. Caticorns was doing you a FAVOR by agreeing to take your tray up front for you. But since you've been nothing but rude, you can walk back here and pick it up yourself.

And with that, she hung up on ET.

BM let me go to lunch to cool down (I get pretty angry and quick, BM could see it in my face that I was about to snap). The only thing my coworkers told me was that ET was in no way disabled. She was in her mid to late 20s, dressed as nice as they come, with no obvious disabilities. They informed me that she just sheepishly asked for her tray and walked away.

I started a month ago, so they still make me wear my ""TRAINEE"" tag, just incase someone gets angry with me. I sometimes feel like customers take advantage of me because of this, but either way, I make my own sales and deal with customers by myself.

Now, for the past month, everyone has been very understanding and patient with my work. Customers and co-workers alike. However, this one older woman came in the other day and completely destroyed the way I see my job.

*Woman walks in. I can tell she is wealthy by all her gold jewelry.*

Me: Hello ma'am, what brings you in today?

Woman: Hi, I saw that you have a white braided leather bracelet. 

Me: Sure, I'd be happy to show you our leather bracelets, although the closest color to white that we carry would be the champagne.

Woman: Okay, let me see it.

*I go around the jewery showcase and pull out the standard champagne leather bracelet.*

Woman: No, that's not the one I saw on the advertisement.

Me: I'm sorry about that. Do you remember how many times it wrapped around the wrist? We have the single and the double bracelets in this color.

*I pull out the double-wrapped bracelet.*

Woman: No, it was thick and it was white, not champagne!

Me: Like I said before, we don't carry our leather bracelets in the color white. They also only come in one standard width.

Woman: This is preposterous! Why would your advertisement lie?!!!

Me: I'm very sorry about that. May I ask where you saw the advertisement?

Woman: In [insert name of large department store chain here]!

Me: That department store is not qualified to sell our jewelry. You might have saw an ad for another brand.

Woman: I HAVE KNOWN THE OWNER OF THIS STORE FOR 30 YEARS AND I WILL HAVE YOU FIRED!

*That escalated quickly...*

Me: You are free to talk to [the owner] about my performance. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you today.

Woman: YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB!

*My manager realizes what is happening and I step away. The woman had to be taken out of our store by security.*

Honestly, did she think I was lying to her or something? Also, I spoke to the owner of the store and he said that she's crazy and not to worry about her. Ughhhhh it's just so frustrating!

[deleted],187,,264,1gyn2k,,1115,"For 8 years I was a pharmacist in a very busy store with a super demanding clientele.  The neighborhood is very wealthy, and they tend to be the kind of wealthy that is convinced its constantly being cheated by everyone.  They expect a lot, and they tend to be ungrateful even after they've gotten it.  Needless to say, while stressful, the store provided me with lots of amusement in retrospect.

Today's story begins when we have a workman come in to look at our water line (the distilled water we use to mix liquid suspensions).  We have a suspended ceiling in the pharmacy, and the water line is above it, so the guy got up on a ladder and went into the ceiling.  

I have no idea what he was standing on up there, but he lost his footing and fell, face first, right through the suspended ceiling onto the floor, which is just carpet squares over concrete.

Everything in the pharmacy stops, as we have a bleeding, unconscious man on the floor.  My fellow pharmacist goes to assess the damage.  I call 911.  He's not dead, but he is out cold.

We are walking distance from the fire station, and the paramedics are there before you know it.  5 minutes, tops.  While they are putting him on a stretcher, I notice the phone ringing and I pick it up.

""I need you to page my doctor at the hospital RIGHT NOW!""  

It's the middle of the day.  We generally don't page during the day.  Plus, with current events being what they are, I am a bit flustered.  ""You want me to page him why?""

""It's an EMERGENCY!  And I was on hold for FIFTEEN minutes!""

This is doubtful.  But I still apologize.  ""I'm sorry, sir, but things are crazy here.  We just had a guy fall through the ceiling.  The paramedics are here.""

""Is he an employee?""

I am baffled, but answer, ""Yes.""

""Then he doesn't matter!  I'm a customer, I'm more important."" Yes, honest to God, the guy actually said that.  ""Are you going to page my doctor or what?""

Now I am really flabbergasted.  ""Um, sure.  Give me the number where I can reach him.""  He does.  ""What am I calling for?""  

""He'll know.  I'll be there in 15 minutes to pick it up.""  And he hangs up.

By now the workman is on his way to the hospital and my manager is scrubbing up the blood on the carpet (which never came completely clean).  I recount the phone conversation to my co-workers, who all decide this guy is the biggest asshole ever.  Then I dutifully page his doctor at the hospital.

The rx I got was the icing on the cake.  His ""emergency"" was for hemorrhoid suppositories.  

The workman, by the way, was more or less okay, but he did end up with a broken nose and a concussion.",The customer is always more important than the bleeding employee on the floor,1379,talesFromRetail
metamaxwell,386,,386,1r14xk,,1111,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

thesistergeek,139,,273,1i6stx,,1115,"I'm interning at a museum for the summer, and one day a week I work the front desk.  During that 10am-4pm timespan, I am the only person who is on two main floors, and often the only staff member in the whole place.  My bosses are wonderful people with a sense of humor, and always back me 100% in whatever I need to do.  It's basically a resort town, filled with upper middle to upper class tourists in the summer (mostly from Boston) who are some of the most self entitled people I've ever met in my life.  I have tons of examples, and this is just one of them.

It was a particularly slow day, before the season really started, so it was nearly noon before the first guests came in.  I'd been chatting with one of our docents, who thankfully served as witness to the whole thing.  A group of nine came in, and I immediately knew there was going to be trouble.  There was just a way that they was looking down their noses at everything.  Those are always the problem ones.  The obvious leader was a ~65 year old woman, dressed to the nines like she was some sort of Kennedy.  I launched into my normal greeting.

""Good afternoon, how are you?  Would you like to tour the museum today?""

She looked at me like I was the lowest speck of dirt on her $400 shoes.  ""Yes, you don't have to take that attitude.  We are going to tour the museum, and it will be free.""

I was a little shocked.  The docent, who's been volunteering since the 80's, said, ""We have free weekends once every couple of months, but other than that there is an admission fee.  It's very small, and it goes to help further education for the local area!""

Faux Kennedy Lady snorted, ""Yes, but *we* will get in for free, you understand.  Do you have anyone more respectful to give a tour, miss?""

""This is our only docent for the day, and if you would like to go further than the front desk, you all will have to pay an admission fee unless you are active duty military, a museum member, or under the age of 6.""

""No, we won't, because *we will* get in *free*.  We are special guests of the director.""  She was completely certain I was going to cave, and the polo bedecked clan of family she had with her was crowding around like they were trying to physically intimidate me.

""If you are a special guest, I have to approve that through the director of the museum.  Let me just call him.""  As I grabbed the phone, she continued talking to be like the was negotiating with a deaf monkey.  My boss said he'd be up in a few seconds, and I held them off just wandering into the building by showing them greeting cards.

There was a firefighters benefit going on that night after hours, and some of the guys were there setting up.  So, trailing just behind our museum director, were two young large firefighters there to help move things in the front hall.

I presented the group as the director's ""special guests.""  The director was very friendly, shaking their hands.  They kept glancing at me, with this look in their eyes like they'd won.  Finally, the director said with a big smile on his face, not losing a beat from his friendly demeanor, ""Please leave.  You have had your opportunity to visit with us, and you have tarnished it.  We welcome you to come back another day, possibly a free family weekend.  Have a lovely day!""  Then he went back downstairs, leaving me with two large firefighters making a wall preventing them from going further inside.

Faux Kennedy Lady huffed, then stormed out, yelling something about being the ruin of all of us.

The firefighters brought the docent and I sweet tea and chili as thanks for a great story.  It was delicious.","Admission should be free for my large group, because I said so!",1388,talesFromRetail
spergus,71,,245,1kq83z,,1115,"I've been working at a coffee chain in a food court for about 4 years, and I've had my fair share of regular customers come and go. Our most common regulars are older folks, whose best part of their day is coming out to the shopping centre (where I work) and getting their daily coffee. 

Ever since I started, this cute old European couple would come in religiously every morning. The man was named Angelo, and I never found out the name of his wife, but they knew my name (I believe my name tag was a giveaway). They would order 2 small cappuccinos, in the round cups (we changed our cup design about 2 years back, but they preferred the old cups so we kept 2 aside for them!). Gradually, I made the change from service to barista. Angelo would greet me enthusiastically every time he came in. ""SPERGUS!!! Ahhhh, your coffee is the best!!"" I'm not the best with compliments, so I would proceed to blush profusely. 

As my coffee skills improved, so did my coffee art. I would always make sure Angelo's cappuccinos looked superb (I can't help it, I attend art school). Hearts, feathers, stripes, or when I screwed it up, an abstract bird. Angelo would go sit about 10 metres from the counter with his wife, and when I'd finish making my coffees, I'd gesture in his direction, they'd both look up excitedly and either Angelo or his lovely wife would come on over. The wife would always say, in her thick European accent: ""Your coffees! All I want to do is look at them! Too good to drink, haha!"" They'd really appreciate it, I really looked forward to seeing them whenever I was working. It was the least I could do.

Anyway, a few months ago they were coming in less frequently. Angelo started sporting a hat. The hat was stylish, however I could tell he was hiding something. They were more grateful than ever for our service. They would say, on more than one occasion how seeing us smile would make them feel happier inside, even if there was sadness around. It would brighten their days. That really meant a lot to me. Especially as I could get some pretty shit people come in and treat me appallingly.

I'd ask Angelo how he was, sincerely, not just as a customer service reflex. I was worried, he didn't look well. He was less cheery than usual. A lot less cheery. I'd ask, how are you and he'd give me this shrug, like, ehh what can you do about it? He was sick. We subsequently saw them less and less.

While I was away overseas for about a month, Angelo's wife came in to the shop. She came in to tell us that Angelo had passed away. She was close to tears, but managed to say his funeral was packed! Not surprised he was a popular guy. My manager was working at the time and had to go around to the back because she too was on the verge of tears. I guess she didn't want to upset the wife any further! I think she's too upset, understandably, to come back to get coffee. The second round cup broke recently too- now there's only one.

**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for sharing similar stories! It has been a pleasure to read them, albeit the sadness. I believe, with the older people especially, it's part of your job to look out for them. It's always distressing when they disappear out of the blue! Come to think of it... I haven't seen Norma in a while...

**UPDATE:** The wife came in today!!! She ordered 3 coffees, for her and her 2 pals. Nice to see her happy. She's still using Angelo's coffee card though (it has his name on it).",When regulars make your job worth doing,1360,talesFromRetail
umegatron1,84,,277,1jac0b,,1111,"So i work in a very high end chocolate store and i kid you not when i say we make the best chocolate in the world.  How high end you ask?  Some of our coworkers wanted to jazz our days up by attacthcing spoons to the pens we use for credit card reciepts and draw some smiley faces on them.  Our boss sat us all down and explained that we were way too classy of a store to allow that to happen.

We usually give out samples of fudge or ice cream whenever people ask for them, but when it's really busy and the store is full, we just put out a plate and let people go after them.  A little risky perhaps, but we seem to have faith in the goodness of our customers, something i tend to doubt from time to time.  

One busy day, we had a bunch of caramel bars out in the store for people to sample, and a group of people are gathering around them, all of the sudden, we hear a voice call out above the others.

""OH MY GOD!  I found a tooth in the chocolate!""

My manager and i snap into action, all these companies and other industries have been in a lot of trouble when people find body parts in their food, so we wanted to difuse the situation as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, if you find a tooth and start shouting about it in front of a bunch of people, you will start what we in the retail world refer to as a stampede.  

MY manager handled the situation wonderfully.  She apologized profusely, gave the lady a bunch of free chocolate, and took the tooth away and threw it out.  Our whole store empties out, as no one wants to buy the toothy chocolate anymore.  Our manager also dons our version of a HAZMAT suit and removes the tooth from our proximity.

A few minutes pass, then we see the tooth lady open our door and walk back into the store.  She walks up to the manager and in a very quiet voice tells her,

""So that actually was my tooth, it just popped out in the bar when i chewed it and i didnt want people to know.  Could i have it back?""  

My manager was very calm, and explained that she had acted as if the tooth wasnt hers, so we handled it the way we had to handle it if we found a foreign object in our product, we throw it away immediately.  

The lady has a meltdown, ""YOU STOLE MY TOOTH!!  YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK ITS MINE!""  

To which my manager responded, ""If you had been honest with us and not tried to incite panic from our customers we could have simply given you back your tooth.  But you decided to cover up your problem and create one for us.  Luckily, we address our problems immediatley and effectivley, something you could stand to learn from.""

The lady, obviously humiliated, straightened up, took one more caramel sample, and walked out the front door, minus one tooth

Above all, I want to give a shout out for those who worked Black Friday. Thanks for toughing it out, you all have the patience of a saint. Thank you for making my week, Reddit!**  
  
Black Friday was, thankfully, somewhat kind to our store. I work as a receptionist in a big-name motorcycle dealership, and I am happy to report that the small crowd we had was well-behaved and generally pleasant to be around. Honestly, bikers looking to get a couple cheap tee-shirts and some reduced-price parts are pretty mellow fellows. When closing time rolled around, there was very little to clean up and I could've counted on one hand how many calls we'd received in the past hour.  
  
I was expecting based upon the time and what I'd bore witness to that most other stores in the area would have a reduction in traffic. Seeing as I'd just gotten my check and the banks were, of course, closed at that hour, I decided to head to the superstore in the area. My plan was to go in, cash the check, and see if I could pick up a couple packs of cards before heading another hour down the road for home.  
  
Right off the bat, upon pulling into the parking lot, I could tell I'd been wrong. The zoo-keepers were apparently on leave, because the animals were still there. I should have just left and taken myself further down south towards home, but I'd just noticed my poor and loyal beast had an empty tank. The only way to quench the thirst of this monster is a cool 50$ and a pump, and I was out of money. 'For you then, you poor dear'.  
  
Check in hand, I entered the fray and immediately bee-lined for the money center. Weaving between buggies of children, televisions, and food (not necessarily in that order), I managed to finally cross the thresh-hold and enter the rope lines. That was the first time I heard what I was going to hear the entire half hour I was in the store:  
  
""Ah-scuse me.""  
  
There was no one near me in the lines, so I continued to walk. It was then that a set of talons took the edge of my shirt sleeve, tugging me back a step.  
  
""AH-SCUSE ME! DON' JUS' WALK AWAY FROM ME!""  
  
Inwardly, I began to panic. Whoever this was was out for blood, and it was mine. My inner monologue began to replay the past couple minutes. Who in the world could I have angered in that short time? Slowly, I turned to face the bird of prey that had cornered me. Beside her was a nest-like buggy with two small children in them, and all three of them were staring right at me.  
  
""Where yo' bathrooms at?!"" She squawked.  
  
I, not being from the area, shrugged. ""I...don't know, I'm sorry.""  
  
""WHAT'CHU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?!"" Her cry rang out, causing other animals of the hunt to perk up. The sound echoed with tones of going in for a kill, and I was the hapless victim. ""WHERE YO' MANAGUH?!""  
  
Then it clicked. For some reason, this furious fowl seemed to think **I** was her usual prey. She had somehow confused the black button up shirt with white pinstripes, plastered with our black and orange logo and name, for the blue shirts the poor employees of the super store had. She had seen my name tag, but her eyes had blacked out the bar-and-shield logo right beside it. She had been leering at my back, with *my store's name and logo on it*, and in her mind thought I worked here.  
  
Having tried to process these facts and gotten the blue screen, I finally decided to tell this woman what I was sure she should've known: ""...I don't...work...here...""  
  
There was silence. She leered and glared and stared at me for a moment longer before huffing. ""Oh...well I'm sorry. You sho' look like it."" She strutted away, her children still staring around her at me, before I could ask how in the world she could've thought that. I was too grateful to be clear of the situation, however, and instead of chasing her down, I crawled through the line and cashed my check. It was over, I was free. This wasn't so bad! I decided I'd go and get my cards after all. Surely, I thought as I strolled out of the safety of the center and out towards the aisles, that would be the only-  
  
""MISS, MISS! MISS CAN YOU HELP ME FIND THE LADIES' NIGHTGOWNS?!""  
  
""I don't know where they are, I'm sorry, I don't work here."" There, okay, that was handled, he was walking away-  
  
""Ma'am? My son spilled his drink over there.""  
  
""I...okay?""  
  
""...Where are you going?! People could slip in that!"" Came the reply. I kept walking. I was regretting this already. I should haven taken off the name tag and the shirt right then and there, but I was cold and there was nowhere to put the tag. ""HEY! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN THIS UP!""  
  
I'd had enough. Slowly, I turned around and pointed at my shirt, right where my store name was. ""Ma'am, I work for THIS company. I don't know WHERE they keep the mop here.""  
  
She just gawked at me like I was speaking some dead language. ""...So you're just going to stand there? Wow. They hire people like you here?""  
  
""I work for [Motorcycle Dealership], ma'am. I don't work here.""  
  
""...Oh...OH."" I left her as she tried to pick up the broken pieces of her life from where I'd shattered it. I was almost to the cards. If I could just get to where the Pokemon were staring at me with sympathy, I could snag a couple and head for a check-out.  
  
""Ugh I cannot BELIEVE this...why don't they have more people on the lines?!"" Because they're all busy helping out other customers...? You know, WORKING?! I refrained from rolling my eyes: Keldeo was welcoming me to the promised land. ""HEY! HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOUR JOB AND GET ON A REGISTER?!"" Nope, not me. Nope...  
  
What is it with people and thinking it's perfectly okay to GRAB SOMEONE? Someone snatched the wrist holding my wallet and I thought for sure I was going to be robbed. ""What are you doing?! Get off me!""  
  
""Don't ignore me when I'm talking to you!"" The lady was close to fifty, looked neat and proper, and oozed anger like a cyst. ""You're not doing anything, go and do your-""  
  
I was done. I was so done. It was my own fault for coming into the store in my work shirt and name tag, but I was not going to be grabbed at twice in one night.  
  
""MA'AM, read my shirt! I work for a **BIKE**. **SHOP**! I'm here doing my own shopping! Just because you have to wait five minutes doesn't mean you can just GRAB people! Shut up, turn around, and just WAIT! Someone will get to you as soon as they can!""  
  
The entire area went dead silent. People were staring at me once again, but I was too upset to care. The woman who had an iron grip on my wrist looked as though she'd stepped in something nasty, and she finally let go. She stepped back into her line, muttering about how that wasn't necessary. The complaints stopped. I slithered over to the card rack and picked up my two precious packs of cards. I ended up in the line beside the same woman who'd grabbed me, so she was glaring at me the whole time.  
  
""Hun?""  
  
I closed my eyes briefly and looked at the man in front of her. He just grinned. ""Biddies like that is why I drink. Gimme your cards. I gottem.""  
  
In the end, he walked me out to my car and wished me a good night. I went home and told everyone how grateful I was that I worked where I did. I felt so bad for the employees. No one should ever be treated like that where they work. No one.

If you've worked in retail, those words make you cringe. *the mall*. 


I've worked in several stores in our local mall. At one point, a local tattoo shop had opened up at the end that me, and my two roommates worked at. When that didn't pay my bills sufficiently, I applied across the street (the aisle separating the lines of stores) at a scrapbooking store. I've never done that before,(scrapbook) but I've worked retail and who the hell can't sell paper and stickers, right? Right. 


I actually loved the job.  I worked 9-5 there, then 5:30-10 at the tattoo parlor.  I went 8 weeks without a day off, but both jobs were so chill, it didn't bother me.  The scrap store was slow, and the customers were mostly middle aged, to elderly women, who were very sweet.  


In the morning, before the stores open, we have Mall Walkers. I'm sure your mall has this too.  Elderly, and the mentally and physically handicap make laps around the mall for exercise.  


One of the mentally handicapped men took a shine to me, I suppose.  When he'd reach my store, he would hang onto the closed gate and watch me set up my daily displays, count my till, typical morning duties.  I'd wave and go back to whatever.  No big deal. 
He would do this every morning, for about fifteen minutes, for a few weeks. My roommates would be across the way, opening the tattoo shop and would smile and shake their head, watching him,watch me. 


Eventually I suppose he decided he could come see me AFTER the store had been opened. Around noon,he'd wander in, and too shy to say much, would touch the prettier papers or sit at one of our craft tables. Usually for about an hour. I assumed he was taking the city bus, given his schedule. He never bothered me, he was quiet and didn't mess up any of the stock. 


I was so used to him, that when I'd get lunch, I'd sometimes get him some sort of sugary pastry. Cupcake or cookie. He'd get all big eyed, and thank me profusely.  I'm not sure what disability he had, but he was often with the crew of disabled. He didn't have Downs, but his speech and physical movements indicated it was mental. He wore the same outfit everyday, (jeans, boots,leather jacket.) and was probably about 6'2, and middle aged. 


This went on from November, until February. For valentine's day, he came in, and gave me a bouquet of purple flowers, made from construction paper.  In his own way, he told me the flowers matched my hair.  I was incredibly moved, and almost cried. He then leaned over as if to hug me.  I went to return this hug, until he grabbed my face and attempted to kiss me! I tried to pull back, but was unable, due to what I assumed at that time was,""retard strength,"" (I apologize for the insensitivity, but that's exactly what went through my mind in this moment.) He wrapped his arms tightly around me and would not let me go. He was  ferociously petting my hair, smelling me, and kissing me wherever he could reach. I screamed for my roommate, who saw what you happening, and came rushing over.  He pulled the man off of me, in a very rough way, while trying to chide him like a child.  ""No! We don't kiss strangers! Stop it!"" 


To which our,""mentally challenged,"" friend responded,""hey man, I was just trying to cop a feel."" We both stared, as the man began to laugh and walked away.  He walked away without any twitches or tics, and even waved goodbye to us.  In a few short moments, he made it very clear that he was not mentally challenged at all. He had fooled both of us this entire time.  

----side note, this is not to say people with mental  retardation cannot wave or speak.  But his speech and mannerisms were quite different than before, demonstrating that he did not have any handicaps whatsoever.","Catfished by,""mentally challenged,"" customer.",1436,talesFromRetail
FredFltStn,278,,353,1o59gs,,1103,"For several years, I worked as a catering manager with a large entertainment company located in Orlando. I previously posted some of these as a comment to someone else’s thread. It got me thinking about all of the crazy requests/issues I came across while doing the job, so I decided to include a few more and post them on their own.

In catering, the corporate events were usually enormous, sometimes with thousands of guests. Amazingly, these always seemed to go relatively smoothly. Maybe it was because most of the companies we catered to had an entire department for planning and coordinating events, and they were seasoned pros. Weddings, on the other hand, were always a pain in the ass.

Here are a few of the wonderful issues I encountered during my tenure.

* I'm sorry you sent out invitations asking them to choose their plated entree then decided to order the buffet because it was cheaper, we’re not going to plate up buffet food and serve your guests once the reception has started.

* I’m sorry, but you do not get a refund because the bride does not like the food. Perhaps she should discuss it with the groom, since he and his parents attended the tasting and selected the menu.  

* I'm sorry we ran out of food. You can't order and pay for a buffet for 100 people, then expect to feed the 200 people that showed up.

* I’m sorry your bar bill was so high, but you did choose to have an open bar with all premium liquors. 

* I’m sorry your guests keep asking when dinner will be served. Perhaps you should explain to them that you selected the “Light Hors d’oeuvre” package for your 6pm reception.

* I'm sorry the groom didn't show. No, we can't just use the food we've already cooked for our next event and give you back your money.

* I’m sorry we ruined your beautiful outdoor wedding and reception. This is what’s known as a “hurricane”, and I cannot make it go away.

* I'm sorry your guests are complaining there’s no meat selection on the buffet. Perhaps you should have taken that into consideration when insisting on a vegetarian menu.

One day I was in jofab as a customer (never worked there) and the lady in front of me is buying fake flowers.  As they're wrapping up the transaction the elderly cashier tells the middle aged woman checking out that they don't have any large bags to use.  MAW is obviously annoyed.  She sees large bags behind the EC and demands she uses those.  EC says she's not allowed to take those bags for whatever reason.  I'm like not sure why that would ever happen but maybe her manager is bitchy.


 MAW starts huffing and puffing and looks to me for support a few times.  Then she decides to be a super bitch to EC and goes ""if you can't give me a bigger bag then just return it all right now!"" So she dumps out the bag of flowers and has EC return it.  As she's returning it MAW keeps huffing and eye rolling and looking back at me to support her.  She says something to me like ""can you believe this"". And I look at her and no lie ""can I believe that a grown woman is acting like a child and being extremely disrespectful to this cashier? No I can't!  I was raised to respect my elders but obviously you weren't.  Stop looking back at me to take your side because there's no way that's going to happen, you're extremely rude.""

I was at a pet shop on Thursday, wearing a white t-shirt and black pants (this company's employees wear bright blue shirts and khakis), buying some food for my chinchillas.

""What sort of pet store doesn't have paper towels for pet accidents?"" she shouted.  ""Ma'am, I don't work here... I'm just shopping.""  She angrily sighed at me and stomped away.

Another time, I was in a young women's clothing store, flipping through a rack of blouses.  Another young woman steps up to me.

FredFltStn,139,,369,1q029c,,1080,"**BACKGROUND:**  I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve.
 
**STORY:**  I’m not sure what perverse logic makes some customers think that if they yell loudly enough; they’ll get what they want. If you’re shopping at my store, you’re in for a nasty surprise. The more loudly you yell, the more likely I am to deny your request, even if it was perfectly reasonable.
 
I heard a woman raising her voice while speaking to one of my cashiers, so I walked over to see what the issue was. A well-dressed lady was berating my cashier and cussing up a storm because we didn’t take American Express credit cards. There was a line of people waiting to check out, but this lady was having a great time making a scene. She was obviously playing it up to the people around her.
 
For years, i didn't take AmEx, because they charged higher fees than the other cards and they were a pain in the ass. I also didn’t take Discover cards, because of issues I’d had with my merchant services provider. As it happens, I had actually switched providers a few months earlier, and I now took all of the major credit cards. Obviously, this particular cashier didn’t know about the change (my fault).
 
I walked up next to the cashier and asked the customer if I could be of assistance. She immediately started yelling at me, and this conversation took place.
 
**LADY:**  I can’t believe you don’t take American Express! I’m spending a lot of money here (she wasn’t) and I want my reward points. What kind of shitty store doesn’t take American Express?
 
**ME:**  American Express charges us higher fees. You’re welcome to pay with cash, Visa, your debit card, or Discover.
 
**LADY:**  You take Discover but you don’t accept American Express?!? What kind of discount are you going to give me since I can’t use my American Express?
 
**ME:**  How about 1%? I believe that’s what AmEx gives back for rewards.
 
**LADY:**  That’s only like 45 cents! You’ve got to be kidding me!
 
**ME:**  I know. It’s hard for me to believe you’re standing here making a scene about 45 cents myself.
 
A couple of people in line actually laughed out loud, and I think she got embarrassed. She paid in cash, snatched her bag, and headed for the door.
 
The guy who had been waiting behind her to check out, stepped up to the counter. He was obviously trying to make a joke, and he said, “I was going to pay with American Express myself, but I guess I’ll have to use cash.”
 
I loudly responded, “Oh, we take American Express…just not HER American Express! My cashier didn’t know we had changed our policy. 
 
I have no doubt the loud mouthed bitch heard the entire conversation. The guy paid with a Visa card and was laughing the entire time.

I work at your regular chicken joint, and the other day a woman and her daughter came in. The woman places her order of three pieces of chicken and one side item. Being the good person I am, when she asks how much it is, I add it up for her and let her know that if she were to get a meal, she could get another side and a biscuit for a dollar less. This is where it gets weird. We go back and forth for ten minutes. Her telling me she wants the cheapest option (rudely) and me telling her the meal is the way to go and then her telling me she just wants what she originally ordered and me telling her that that is the more expensive one, yada yada yada. Finally she gets it and takes another side item. 

With that I had thought we were out of the woods. Then the total happened... Now mind you, the adult daughter never flinched for any of this.

Me: ""Your total is $13.andsomeoddcents.""

Lady: ""That much!!! You are taking all my gas money!!!"" (yelling, now)

I don't understand this. If you do not have the money to eat out, maybe don't? And why yell at your cashier? They are absolutely the last people to have control over what the prices are. Maybe call corporate and complain about them? Anybody else have to deal with this on a regular basis?

My first day there, I got an earful. Some guy bought a pack of Duracell batteries, and brings them back not an hour later for a return. I think, maybe they were the wrong size, so I ask him for the batteries and the receipt.

He hands me his receipt, and an opened, torn, and retaped package containing 2 Energizers, a Rayovac, and an Everready. Oh, hell no.

I tell him, ""Sir, I can't accept this return.""

He replies, ""Why not? It's in the pack AND I have my receipt. I did everything you want!""

My efforts to convince him that returning 4 dead batteries (i tested them) from 3 different wrong brands only led to a massive fit on his part. As he berated me, I went and got my manager, who said he knew how to deal with this type.

The irritating oaf turns his vulgarities towards said manager, who reaches under the counter and pulls out a stadium air horn. In the middle of his shouted sentence, the psychopath got an earful of arena-style hearing loss.

The manager said, breaking the silence, ""You fucked up. Leave. Now.""

The oaf gathered his belongings and hauled ass out the door.

**Do you sell Christmas Trees?**  -  No, but since that’s common around the holidays, I’ll give you a pass. You would think that the absence of trees would have tipped you off.

**Do you sell Tools?**  -  No, but I’ve seen tents that do, so I understand your question. However, since you’re standing in the middle of my tent, surrounded by fireworks when you ask the question, I’m going to be snarky when I tell you no.

**Do you sell puppies?**  -  This one was bad. What was worse is that you INSISTED that you had purchased a puppy from us before. Not from another company in a tent, but specifically from my company, at this location. You even claimed that my casher was the exact woman who had sold it to you. As the final act of insanity, you screamed at my cashier and called her a liar when the cashier denied it.

**Do you sell gasoline?**  -  I don’t even know how to answer this question. Have you purchased gasoline from a tent before??? This one was so bad; I didn’t even bother to answer you. I just stared at you until you got flustered and walked out.

**Do you sell drugs?**  -  I was so dumbstruck, I actually had to ask you to repeat your question. You would think that the off duty police officer, sitting behind the counter 10 feet away, dressed in full uniform, would have made you pause. But you actually repeated the question, and then seemed confused when the officer asked you if you were stupid.

**Do you sell toilet paper?**  -  No, no, and hell no. I don’t even want to know why you asked the question.

**Do you sell Fireworks?**  -  Really? You’re standing in my tent, surrounded by fireworks, with firework videos playing on a twelve foot screen suspended from the ceiling, underneath the enormous banner that reads “FIREWORKS – BUY 1 GET 1 FREE”!!! No. I sell pets. Would you like to buy a puppy?

Cautiously, i unlock the door to tell him we are closed.  He is all hopped up and wanting to come inside to look at and buy a system.  I tell him we are closed and he is going off about not being able to buy a system anywhere.  Now he has a lazy eye and that kind of creeps me out and with the good eye he looks at me and asks could he at least look inside to see what we sell?  I say tomorrow at 9.  He is pleading with me.  So i say ""what the hell, come on in"".  He is almost crying with joy as he motions to the driver of the other car to come in too.  He is like a kid at Christmas and wanting to know what amp and woofers are the ""baddest &amp; loudest""?  He is non-stop, hyperactive like a tweeker I'm thinking so keep an eye on him. 

Meanwhile a lady driving the other car comes wandering in and she asks if it's OK that she comes in too?  I say of course because your with this guy right?  She smiles and says yes this is her son and he just bought his SUV and wants a loud stereo for it.  She took a seat at the counter while i explained to her son, Anthony what would be the loudest and baddest bass system.  He is going off!  ""I want it, I want it now"" is what he is saying.  I say ""we all do"" but a lot of us don't have $2500.00 to drop on it"".  With the one lazy eye going sideways and the other looking at me he says ""I DO"" .  So he starts saying to Mom how much can i spend?  Mom looks at me and says ""how much is this your talking about?""  I say about $2600.00 not installed"".  She says ""yeah no problem"".  Tony is bouncing around saying ""yeah, fuck yeah, oh hell yeah""  pacing like a caged tiger.

But Mom says OK if that's what you want lets get it.  So I play along and start writing the sales invoice and gathering all the various components and boxes and packages and the ticket totals $2690.00 and she hands over a credit card and so I figure OK who knows?  I ask her if I should run it as Credit or Debit and she say's Debit.  Debit means you must have a pin number and less likely to be stolen. I run the card and it instantly gets an approval. I'm jacked.  So I ask Mom how she found us and she says that they had already been to 3 other stores and they looked at Anthony and wouldn't let them in and said they were closed.  Now it is about 7:00pm and they were close to closing time, but they wouldn't even answer the door to talk to them as i did. She said he has a medical disability that makes him act like he does and he just received a very sizable settlement from an accident that allows him to spend like this.  He promised himself if he got better he would buy a SUV and have the loudest bass system he could buy, and today he was released to be able to drive again.  I grew many orders of respect for both Anthony and Mom as i helped them load their new loudest and baddest bass system into his new SUV.  Seeing Anthony so happy was making Mom cry and she was hugging me like I did some good for her son.  I too got swept up in all the raw emotions going off like fireworks in my parking lot between Mother and son and just let them happen.  It was truly awesome. Pure, unadulterated JOY. So seldom seen nowadays.  It really was.  So the TL/DR version would be:  Don't judge people by their looks, and every now and than let someone in to look around even after your closed, because you just never know.

11Petrichor,144,,178,19mw61,,1043,"As I've said before, I work at Gothy Mall Clothing Store [GMCS for short]. I've recently been promoted from regular old register peon, to Barely Making Above Minimum Wage Management peon, also called Keyholder. Making waves. 

Anyway, while getting ready to close down for the night our phone rings. So I answer ""Thank you for calling GMCS at Downtown Mall, this is 11Petrichor. How can I help you?"" 

So guy starts giving me some speech. I mean we get weird calls but nothing like this. 

Old Man: *Yes, hi. This is Greg Smith. I'm at 1000 North Main Street and my upstairs neighbor, Bob, he broke off his master key in the main gate.*

At this point, I'm not sure I'm hearing him correctly. We have 3 locations in my city, one of them on the same road this guy is on. And we have gates that come down at night and we lock them. I don't know the names of management in the other stores though, and our music is obnoxiously loud, so I'm wondering if I'm even hearing him correctly at this point. 

Me: Sir, I...

OM: *Well Bob said he called you already, but I don't know if I believe him and the problem is that no one is going to be able to open that door until it's fixed.*

Me: I'm not sure I can help....

OM: *And Bob is only here on weekends. He lives in Buffalo during the week. So how am I supposed to get in and out of my house all week if no one comes to fix it????*

Bam. He's got the wrong number and this is not my problem.

Me: Sir I'm really sorry to hear about the trouble you are having but you do realize you called GMCS and there is nothing anyone here can do about it?

OM: *I did what?* 

Me: You called GMCS. At Downtown Mall. We're a clothing retailer for teens and young adults. 

OM: *NO. THIS IS REALTY PROPERTIES AND I NEED YOUR HELP*

Me: Sir, my name tag says GMCS. I thanked you for calling GMCS when I answered the phone. There is death metal blasting in the background loud enough to drown out the sound of a 747. Does it sound like you called Realty Properties? 

OM: *YOU'RE LYING TO ME!!!* 

Me: .... Sir I can promise you I'm not lying. 

OM: *I DIALED 555-2250. THAT'S YOUR NUMBER. YOU ARE REALTY PROPERTIES AND YOU NEED TO STOP LYING TO ME RIGHT NOW.*

Me: Sir, our number is 555-2550. You misdialed. This is GMCS. You need to call your property manager and get this dealt with. I don't get paid enough to listen to you scream at me. 

OM: *I'M COMING DOWN TO YOUR OFFICE. I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR BOSS ABOUT THIS.* 

Me: Cool! Make sure you remind them that [*insert current promos here*]!!! Have a great time sir!

morgueanna,113,,286,1hxswb,,1050,"This story is INCREDIBLY long, but I think it's worth it.

Reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hwyyp/retiring_from_retail_tales_of_woe_redemption/) awesome tale of outrageous expenditures reminded me of the few times in retail that I also had customers spending way more than they should.

Working in the Goth Store at the mall in a small town, we had our share of regulars. About a dozen of those were the local strippers- having a well stocked kinky section in the late 90's, before Amazon and online ordering became popular, meant that we were a one stop slut shop for some.

This one particular day everything is going smoothly and the mall is a little dead. Then two of my regular strippers come walking in, arm in arm with a man I've never seen before. He's middle aged, balding, wearing a suit jacket. Um, ok, not our regular clientele, but hey, whatever.

I go over to greet them and immediately notice something is up. They're positively *fawning* over this guy, doing the whole bit- fingers trailing up and down his jacket, whispering and giggling in his ear, etc. It was like a parody of seduction.

I could tell immediately they were taking this guy for a ride. But again, who am I to say anything? The ladies start picking out outfits- the sluttier the better. Best of all, every time they tried something on for him, he would hold on to it in a growing pile of lacy undergarments, too short skirts, and see through tops. After an hour, I eventually started taking the piles up to the register.

After *two* hours I was starting to lose my patience. They had tried on almost every combination of clothing in the store and done a little strip tease in each one for the guy. I was starting to think that this was a session- where a client pays for a fantasy, and this particular fantasy was shopping. I'm starting to think they won't buy *anything* and start sorting the clothing to be put back out on the sales floor.

That's when he comes up to the register and tosses his credit card on the counter. ""Anything my girls want, they get,"" he says, and puffs his chest out. I swear to god, he *puffed it out* and tilted up his chin. I'm starting to look for the hidden camera because people don't really behave like this in real life, do they?

Again, whatever. I'm overjoyed that they're actually going to buy something, but at the same time I still feel bad for the guy, completely oblivious to the idea that these girls are just taking advantage of him. I put two associates on the register to bag and ring everything up, and as they're going, I asked a few times ""Are you sure you want this skirt? Because it's the same as this other skirt,"" just trying to give the guy an 'out'. Nope, he wants it all. 

It takes almost an hour to ring it all through and the total ends up being almost three thousand dollars. It's at this point that he hesitates. Oh Christ, I'm thinking. He squirms a little, and the girls' hands drop down to waist level and the whispering begins again. His face brightens and he nods approval to run the card. I'm sweating bullets waiting for the stupid register to tell me whether or not it would take it.

Card approved.

The girls squeal and kiss him on either side of the face, and grab their booty. I go to the back and collapse into a chair, half exhausted and half giddy over the ridiculous sale.

A few days later, I'm working in the store and I see two women walk in the front door holding a massive amount of our store bags. Oh shit, I think, they're back.

They come up to the register and drop the bags. ""We want to return this stuff,"" one of them says, while the other one chimes in with ""Yeah, it don't fit right.""

I sigh inwardly and go up to break the news to them.

I smile and say ""No problem ladies. Do you have the credit card the clothes were charged to?""

Blank stares.

""Yeah...you see, you can't return items just for cash. That's not how it works. If items are bought with a credit card, that's not *money*. That's a promise of money *in the future*, but no money *today*. So you don't get any money *today*. If you want to return anything, you'll have to bring your...friend back in with his card.""

The women are furious and started cussing me out. That just made me happier, because I now had a valid reason to call mall security and have them escorted from the store. You see, if they had been smart, they would have asked for my district manager's info, and depending on her mood, she could have overridden me and offered them cash. Now, they were banned from the store for threatening me, and this being the only location for 400 miles, there was no chance they could hustle anyone else.

leveraction1970,70,,197,1d4l5m,,1036,"I worked in a medium sized video store chain for about a decade. I worked as everything from clerk to manger and district manger in that time. I have always hated customers. Hiding that fact was always a challenge. 

One day we had a customer that was upset that we had charged his credit card over a hundred dollars. We did this because he had rented 3 Sony Playstation games for his kid. Our games had those CD shield protective stickers that were stuck to the back and impossible to take off without destroying the game. His kid had tried to peel them off, and killed three fairly new games. The mom came in and claimed that they didn't work and wanted to exchange them. The clerk told her what her son had done to the games and that she was now responsible for the replacement of the games her son ruined. When my employee told her how much it would cost to replace them, she said ""Good luck with that."" and walked out. 

When I came in later that day my employee showed me the games and told me what happened. I call their house and got the father. I explained what had happened and that I could probably cut him a little bit of slack on the replacement cost. His response ""Fuck you, I'm not paying anything."" He hung up and I charged his credit card, the one that he must have forgot we kept on file. 

A few weeks later he got the credit card bill in the mail and came down to the store to yell at me. I tried to explain that he was responsible. I tried to tell him that if he could go find replacements at a used game store cheaper I would refund the full price which we had charged him. 

He started off with the ""I'll sue you"" and then went to the ""I'll report you to the Better Business Bureau"" to ""I'll report you to the State's Attorney General."" When he realized that I wasn't intimidated by his threats he very smugly said this to me. 

Douche-Nozzle Customer - ""I know the owner, and you are fucked for how you treated me. When I tell him you'll be fired so quick it will make your head spin."" 

Asshole me - ""You know David?"" 

DNC - ""Yeah I know David, and you're so fucked."" 

AHM - ""The owners name is Peter."" 

DNC - ""That's what I meant."" 

AHM - ""Actually his name is Jack."" 

DNC - ""Fuck you.""

KitInaka,747,,445,18gbtx,,1037,"To preface this story I should say a few things. 

1: This Manager has already had a talking to for being extremely sexist toward her male workers (myself included)
2: She also pins any work she might have to do off on everyone else in the store and sits in the managers office talking on her phone.
3: MLP:FiM has just been released and the new toys have just come in.
4: I've only been working in the store for a month and we just remodeled so it's taking longer than normal to learn the layout of the store.

I was an ""Electronic Sales Specialist"" at a popular overpriced toy store when a man and his son walk up to the Electronic Counter. 

**Me:** Hi! Can I help you find anything today?

**Dad:** Not sure. Me and my son are looking for looking for the new My Little Pony toys but we couldn't seem to find them. He's taken a liking to the show. (At a whisper) and so have I.

**Me:** Ah, well we just gt done with a remodel and inventory so the store is still sort of jumbled. Give me one second. 

I turn around and look into the Managers Office as its behind the counter and call for the Bitchy Bigot Manager (Hence forth called BBM) 

**Me:** Hey, BBM! Where did the My Little Pony toys get moved too?

**BBM:** Oh god...Shouldn't you know that!! (Get's up from chair) I swear. (Walks out of office and sees the Man and his Kid) Who's the Pony Toy for?

**Me:** This Guest and his child.

**BBM:** What do THEY want pony toys for?

(At this point, I've had it with her attitude. She's made comments like this before and been written up for it. But this time, I take it into my own hands.)

**Me:** The same reason that Girls want Nerf Guns. You know what? Nevermind. I think me and the Guest can find them on our own. (On Radio) Service, I'm helping a guest. If someone needs the keys, I have them in girls.

**BBM:** You can't do that!

**Me:** Oh yes I can. I've had it with your sexist attitude toward Men and in general. Personally, I like the show as they (I gesture to the customers) do and there is no way I'm gonna let you demean them and me.

The BBM looks flabergasted as I walk off toward the back of the store but am stopped by another person who walks up. 

**Me:** I'm sorry sir. I... (I stop as I notice that this is the District Manager)

**BBM:** AH HA! Now your gonna get it for talking back to me!

**DM:** Actually no BBM. I wanted to stop him because I wanted to commend him for handling you the way he did. (To Me) Make sure these guests get exactly what they want. (To BBM) I think we need to have a talk in the back office.

I walk off with the Customer and his son and together we find the Pony toys and I help them pick out their favorites (Dad included) and as I get to the front I see the DM standing there. He tells me that the BBM was fired once they got to the back and that the Guest's purchase today is free of charge. He also gave me and the customer a 50$ gift card as he says that his son has also taken a liking to the show and wants to make sure that anyone can get the toys that they want.

**TL;DR** Manager was a Bitch and got fired for it. I got a Gift Card for standing up to her.

FredFltStn,204,,387,1pvl00,,1032,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  As you can imagine, we get a wide range of customers in my fireworks store. One of my top priorities is customer service. That priority goes away when you start acting like a creeper.

Most of my staff are teenagers, and most of them got the job because I'm friends with their parents. In general, I have a staff of teenage girls who work the registers, and guys who work out on the sales floor moving boxes, stocking shelves, and doing sales. I tend to spend most of my time on the floor talking to customers and selling fireworks.

Occasionally, the girls behind the counter get hit on. Pretty sure that happens almost everywhere. What happens even more often, is that the teenage guys who work for me hit on girls that come into the store. I’ve had to step in a few times, mostly when the guys start following around some girl like a puppy dog instead of working, but overall, we don’t have very many issues.

One evening, one of my cashiers grabbed me and pulled me aside to talk to me. There was an older gentleman who had been hanging around the counter and made a few inappropriate comments to one of the cashiers, and she was getting uncomfortable. I walked back to the counter to see if I could help.

I walked up and pleasantly asked the guy if he needed any help. He was casually dressed and looked to be in his mid-50’s I would guess. He told me that he was just about finished shopping, and said he didn’t need any help. I hung out near him at the counter, hoping that he would get the message.

Apparently he did, and he started to put his stuff up on the counter for the cashier to ring him out. I stayed until she was finished ringing in his stuff. She gave him the total, and I started to walk away to help another customer. I was probably about 5 feet away when I heard him ask, “How much to see those tits?”

I called over to two of the guys on the floor, and then stepped in front of the creeper.

My staff and I carefully escorted the gentlemen out and helped him into his car. I also explained to him that he was no longer welcome at my store. That’s my story, and I’m pretty sure my staff will tell you the same thing.

A couple of the most aggravating lines when ringing up purchases were,

""Don't you think god deserves a helping hand?""

""What is Gods price?""

""Don't you think God deserves 10% above cost?""

He gave her the ID and everything progressed until she handed him his card and ID back. At this point the man angrily told her he didn't appreciate being treated this way and he wanted a refund. He then began walking out of the store. The cashier called him back saying she can't do a refund without the card. He comes back and says ""This racism has to stop"". Me, my wife, and the cashier look at each other wondering what exactly is going on. At this point he says ""You never asked that woman to see her ID, its wrong the way you treated me.""

mypenexploded,155,,211,1faa34,,1013,"It's my first time posting here as I've been waiting for something particularly exciting to happen at work that would be /r/TalesFromRetail worthy. Let me tell you, today took the cake. 

I work at an international big box home improvement store as a cashier. I've been there for 2 years and am one of the most versatile associates on the front end; I can work lumber cash, garden cash, returns, front end cash, self-checkout, customer Service Desk and Tool Rental. I recently got a promotion to Head Cash (basically just opening and closing all the registers and managing the cashiers and lot associates throughout the day) and am in training right now for that. 

So I go into work this morning for 5am to open the 20 registers in the store and get things ready for the day. Now, different parts of our store are staffed at different times of the day. Lumber cash and self-checkout open at 6am, but I dont get a cashier in for front end cash until about 8, and Returns sometimes isn't open until 9. Its just the way our schedule runs but it's fine because whoever is on self-checkout can open up on the cash next to it and the service desk can do returns. Not a big deal right? Well I didn't think so...

So this customer walks in at around 7:30. There's still virtually no one in the store at this hour except for the odd contractor, so when he walks up to the self-checkout area with a couple low-ticket items looking annoyed and confused, I don't hesitate to call him over and open up on the regular cash right next to the self-checkout control station. He ignores the customary questions of ""Hi how are you today, did you find everything okay, will this be on a store credit card today?"" and instead chooses to stare angrily at the screen that everything I scan is showing up on. Jerk. I finish the transaction with him, hand him his receipt, and wish him a wonderful day. 

Fast forward about 3 hours, I've surrendered the head cash phone and keys and have been sent into Returns to help the girl in there clear her line up. Lo and behold, who walks in but Grumpy Morning Guy. We'll call him GMG. So he gets in line and I see that he has a cart FULL of stuff- none of it what I had rung up for him this morning. And I knew- I KNEW- he was going to be trouble. Anyone who works in retail can pick out a trouble maker a mile away, and as I had already confirmed this morning that he wasn't the nicest of people, I slowed down my last transaction just a see bit so that the girl working with me (we'll call her M) would have to deal with him. I know, I'm a terrible person. 

So M greats him and asks if he has a receipt for the product he's returning, he says no. She asks if he bought it with a credit or debit card as we can look purchases made within 90 days up if he had, he says no. She TELLS HIM his only option is a store credit, he says that's fine. So M gets to work scanning all the little odds and ends this guy has in his cart. She totals it up and its around $250. She gives our manager a quick call to get permission to give him back such a large amount, and she gets the go ahead as everything is in perfect condition. GMG signs the pin pad to verify the return, and she hands him his receipt and store credit and tells him to have a great day. 

He looks at the card in his hand for a moment, and then turns to her with a look of disgust on his face,
""What the fuck is this?""

I could see that M was a little taken back, people aren't usually so aggressive with her.
""It's your store credit."" She answered politely. 

GMG shakes his head and smiles condescendingly before flicking the card across the counter at her, 
""I want my fucking cash back.""

Oh here we go. 

I had cleared the line by now but felt it was a good idea to stick around so I started fiddling with things behind the counter.

""Sir, you don't have a receipt and you didn't buy any of it on a credit or debit card, there's no way for me to give you your cash back.""

He gets really mad at this obvious statement of fact (really, what did you think was going to happen?) and slams his hands down on the counter, leaning over it to get in her face, and once more says,
""I WANT. MY FUCKING. CASH.""

I saw that M was getting a little freaked out now, so I stepped forward to help her, 
""Sir there is *physically* no way for us to give you back your cash. The computer wont allow it. You have to have your receipt or have paid with a debit card. I'm sorry but she's right, store credit is your only option.""

""Just PUSH the FUCKING button and give me back my FUCKING CASH!""

Oh right! I totally forgot about the secret 'give this back in cash because I say so' button! GMG isn't listening to either of us, so I call one of my Assistant Store Managers in. We'll call her D. Now D is a little blonde woman, not intimidating looking in the least, but she doesn't take crap from customers. She walks in and asks him what the problem is.

""These idiots wont give me back my fucking cash!"" 

""Well did you have your receipt?""

""No!""

""Did you pay with a card?""

""No!""

""Then you're not getting your cash back. We need proof of purchase to do that, and seeing as you don't have any you're going to have to be happy with a store credit.""

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!? ITS MY FUCKING MONEY! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING CASH RIGHT NOW OR I SWEAR TO GOD! I DONT HAVE A RECEIPT BECAUSE SHE FUCKING TOOK IT!""

He's pointing at me now. 

Why's he pointing at me?

Oh, because I took his receipt. Wait, what?

""Pardon?""

""SHE took my receipt! I was in here this morning and she was the one who checked me out. SHE TOOK IT!"" 
D turns to look at me, her eyes saying 'What is this crazy talking about?' 

""I did help him check out this morning, but he only bought 3 things, and none of them are are this table. I gave you your receipt before you left sir.""

""YOU FUCKING LIAR IM GONNA FUCKING SUE FUCK FUCK FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH-""

""Sir if you don't stop swearing I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

He obviously ignores her and continues on his very loud, very obscene rant about how the store is trying to scam him and I stole his receipt etc. 

At this point D gets on her walkie and radios another manager to Returns, as GMG looks like he's ready to punch someone in the face. Two of our male managers come in, one of them is one of the biggest humans I've ever come across in my life. I'm talking 6'3"", 350 lbs at least. He's a big boy, and we'll call him J.
J walks up to GMG with a HUGE smile on his face, and asks him what the problem is. GMG tells him very 
explicitly how us fucking idiot cashiers should be fired because we're stealing from him. 

J, still smiling, informs him that if he lets one more profanity slip he will *personally* remove him from store property and hold him until the police arrive, ensuring that he's charged for verbally assaulting everyone in the room. 

""Now,"" his shit eating grin has gotten wider, ""Would you like to take your store credit and leave, or would you like to lose it and leave with me?""

GMG splutters indignantly for a moment, surveys the crowd of managers, associates, and now customers staring at him, grabs the store credit off the counter and storms out of the store. 

Best part?

The doors in front of Returns are automatic doors, but they are entrance only, so he ran head first into them expecting them to open up on his way through. He then had to walk aaaaaall the way around the front end cash area to get to the exit while everyone in Returns laughed at his instant karma.

GUY : Yes sorry about that but you can't hold what's not in your hands.


I start to laugh and his wife/girlfriend looks shocked at what we've said to each other and with a glint in her eye tells us that we should be ashamed of ourselves. We chat for a while about the local area and how much they are enjoying their time over here. I give them some things that they might like to try in and about town and where to avoid. from chatting i discover the couple come from San Francisco, and i mention that i've seen quite a lot of the area due to being a mythbusters fan. i ask them about living with the earthquakes and to my horror the wife/girlfriend says ""Oh honey, you've not lived until you've felt the earth move""

Right now i'm lost for words. The silence was growing when thankfully she broke the silence by saying she was just teasing me.

By now i've swiped their credit card and just as they are about to leave the guy puts a £5 note on the counter and thanks me for being so friendly. I thank him but must refuse as we are not allowed to take tips. He says ""oh go on, nobody will know"" i look up at the cctv camera and he gets the message. Once again as they leave they thank me and wave goodbye when they drive off the forecourt.

A little while later just as i'm due to go on lunch my supervisor ask's me to go over to the main store as the duty manager would like a word. I ask if i've did something wrong and she tells me that she does not know of any problems.

Well i get to the office in the main store and the boss is sitting there with a huge smile on his face. Sit down rumple, don't worry you're not in any trouble.
I just had a gentleman come in store this morning praising you on your customer service and how you made them feel welcome not only here but to the country too. He told me that he tried to offer you a tip but you politely refused, So he came in here and asked me to give you this instead. 

He stands up shakes my hand and gives me a envelope containing a letter of commendation from the company and TWO £20 gift cards. One from the company and the other along with a small hand written note from the American couple thanking me again. Below was a email address asking me to contact them if i'm ever on their side of the pond.

I feel kinda guilty as i was just doing my job and here i am with £40 and a letter of commendation. My manager sees this on my face and tells me to enjoy it. it's not that often that people come in to praise his staff. He then asks me just what the couple and i were talking about. I told him mainly touristy things and what local events are going on. I thought it best not to mention the fart jokes...

TennisAndBeer,119,,229,1lenz1,,1015,"While I work in retail, in this story I was actually shopping with several of my friends for this story. 

I was at the mall with a few friends when a few of the girls wanted to go to a fairly high end woman's clothing store in a nice town. The guys decided to make a coffee stop to minimize the amount of time we had to spend in the store. 

Myself and two of my buddies walked into the store just as a woman calls out ""Erica? Erica?"" She looks around breifly and then begins shouting ""ERICA? ERICA?"" A store employee comes over and asks her what's wrong. She says she can't find her daughter, who has long blond hair. My friends and I are still by the entrance and stay there so that we could see if some sketchy guy tried to leave with a little blond girl. 

The mother is still shouting and is at this point crying. The employee asks her when and where she last saw her daughter. She says thirty seconds ago and right near where she was standing. The employee asks how old Erica is. The mother says she's 18. Not 4. Not 7. Not even 12. 18 years old. Old enough to drive herself to the store, stopping to buy lottery tickets and tobacco on the way, and having a pint in pretty much any country but America. 

The employee and the group of people who have noticed are visibly shocked and as the employee goes to page her the daughter walks over from two sections away, unbelievably embarrassed that her mother is at this point screaming her name and sobbing. Just as the icing on the cake, both the girl and the mother were holding cell phones. So rather than call her phone, the mother had been screaming her name. Her mother was relieved but everyone else was confused.

When the mother freaked out about losing her daughter everyone assumed that it was a little kid rather than, for all legal purposes, an adult. In all likelihood, the daughter was about to go to college and spend months away from the mother, but the mother was freaking out because the girl was gone for literally less than two minutes in a high end store in a nice town. 

I was impressed with the professionalism simply for not questioning the age of the girl. I couldn't believe the reaction of the mother",Woman freaks out when she loses her daughter,1244,talesFromRetail
Zomyan,165,,249,1ivipw,,1008,"Discovered the subreddit a short time ago and have been lurking ever since. 

Today, something happened that, since I entered the work force 13 years ago, has never happened to me before. I lost my cool and I yelled at a customer. Not just snapped at, I raised my voice to its full volume and pitch and I laid into him. 

The event:

I work at a small family owned Liquor/Convenience store. When I say small, I mean small. I have one coworker not including the owner. The normal rules of retail don't apply here, I have complete permission from my boss(the owner) to defend myself against rude customers.

Every week since I was hired in May of 2012 this man comes into the store, we'll call him Fat Hick(FH for short). He walks down one of the 3 aisles in the store, grab a 750ml of Southern Comfort and brings it up to the counter. Demands I grab him a log(5 cans) of chew. I ring of the tobacco and as I'm ringing up the SoCo, the same conversation happens pretty much every time. This is the way it went today that made me lose it:

FH: $15.99?! That's a complete load of shit! Down at [Big box grocery with membership card that grants discounts] it's only $9.99! Your boss is charging way to fucking much for this!

Me:(In diplomatic retail voice) I'm sorry sir but I don""t make the prices. If you'd like the owner will be here [date and time] and you can take it up with him.

FH: You're fucking right I'm going to take it up with him you stupid fag! He's ripping people off with prices like these!

(I'm at a loss at this point, while he's always been pretty rude, never in my year+ employment has he ever called me names. Now, I pride myself on being really hard to piss off. I have never hit anyone out of anger in my entire life and I am now using all of my willpower not to slam my fist into this guys face. It wasn't calling me a fag that infuriated me, but the way he was speaking to me. Like not only was I an inferior form of life but that I was also mentally disabled)

Me: You know what? Fuck off asshole! Take the goddamn metal rod out of your ass. You want to pay $9.99 for some of the shittiest whiskey I have ever tasted? Then get your fat ass out of this store. I am sick and fucking tired of you doing this every fucking week! We are not [big box store]! You want that price, go there. And by the way, I also shop there. It's not $9.99, its $12.99 and only if you sign up for their fucking membership card, otherwise you're paying $18.99 for the fucking bottle. Oh, and you know what? You can just get the fuck out, NOW. I'm done dealing with your shit. Get your alcohol and chew somewhere else, because you are no longer welcome here. You have 10 seconds to get the fuck out that door before I call the police. 

And if you think I'm bluffing, I'll call the owner too. You can be damn sure he wont give a fuck about whether you shop here or not. 

FHL: I....uh..uh..

Me: (picking up phone) 10...9...I'd seriously get the fuck out...8....7....

FH: Runs out the door. 

I called my boss and let him know what happened. He came and relieved me for an hour so I could calm down. 

I know it doesn't seem like much here, but I am a very non-confrontational person. I had enough conflict while in the army to last me a lifetime. 

I walked out the back door into the private alley, lit a cigarette and started shaking so hard that if someone witnessed it, they probably would have thought I was having a seizure.

Tl;Dr: Lost my temper on a customer and having him try and pull the same bullshit every week for over a year. Was shaken up more by this than entire stint in US Army.

Edit: Thank you everyone. I didn't expect this to get the attention that it did. When I posted this last night I was still angry. More at myself for losing my temper than at the customer. Reading all of your comments while at work today really made me feel better about what happened. So thank you, all of you. :)",Lost My Cool Today,1257,talesFromRetail

As I said my closing statements she looked at me and said ""Kids just don't know how to listen, want to buy this one?""

And with the little girl being about 7 or 8 I looked at her and said ""Not yet.""

FredFltStn,137,,375,1oi2fv,,1001,"This happened around 4 years ago, but It still makes me shake my head.

**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  I received a phone call from a distressed woman (DW) complaining that several of the fireworks that she had were duds, and that it had ruined their night. I immediately went into apology mode, and told her that we would replace her fireworks AND refund her money, she just needed to bring the stuff back to the store. 

I apologized again for the issue and explained that I hand pick my inventory, carrying only the best and most reliable stuff. Because of this, we don’t get many returns, but I want to make sure that we go overboard fixing the problem when we do. She was still unhappy, but agreed to bring back her fireworks later that day.

I wasn’t at the store that morning, so I called and let my staff know about the issue. I told them to replace the duds and refund her money, and to make sure we apologized again for her inconvenience. Apparently, the woman showed up about an hour later and something similar to this conversation took place (REALLY wish I was there. This is what my cashier told me happened).

**DW:**  I called earlier about some fireworks that didn’t work. The person on the phone told me they would refund my money.

**CASHIER:**  I’m so sorry you had some duds. The person you spoke to isn’t here now, but he let me know about the problem and we’ll definitely take care of it. Do you have the fireworks?

**DW:**  They’re in the back of my car.

**CASHIER:**  OK. I can help you unload them and then we’ll get you taken care of.

My cashier walks out to the car with the customer. Apparently, the entire time DW is berating her about how we ruined her night. They had friends over, and they were embarrassed that the stuff wouldn’t work. They make sure to let everyone at the party know it was our fault.

**CASHIER:**  (When DW pops the trunk) Ma’am, these fireworks aren’t from here.

**DW:**  What do you mean?!?

**CASHIER:**  These are actually [other company] fireworks. We don’t sell these here. You can see the [other company] name and logo on everything (this is a national fireworks chain, and LOVES to wrap all of their stuff in their own artwork and logo). 

**DW:**  I’m SURE that we purchased these here. You should be ashamed that you sell such junk, and I want my money back. I’m going to tell everyone I know how you’re trying to rip me off! The man on the phone promised me that you would refund my money.

**CASHIER:** We only offer a money back guarantee on items we sell, not on things you buy from other companies.

**DW:**  It shouldn’t matter where I bought it, it’s still fireworks, and since you sell fireworks, you owe me a refund.

**CASHIER:**  That’s not going to happen.

The cashier turned around and walked back to the store, leaving DW bitching in the parking lot.

Sooooo……  A few weeks later, I get a letter in the mail addressed to the “Owner of Company” from DW. She rants about how we have ripped her off, how she’s letting all of her friends know what a terrible store we have, and how she will take me to small claims court if I don’t give her a refund.

I took the time to compose a response to DW, since she took the time to write the company owner a letter.
&gt;Dear DW,
&gt; Thank you for taking the time to write us and let us know about the problem you had at our store.
&gt;
&gt;We have researched the problem and I think we have conclusively determined the underlying cause of your issue.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You are batshit crazy.

copenhagen120,107,,215,1iynox,,1003,"Story time #2! You guys liked my last story, so here's another good one that happened recently.

I work at a high-end clothing store in a nice shopping plaza in a nice town. So, most of our customers are well-off and believe it or not, the vast majority are pretty pleasant, kind, appreciative people. Like any store, we have issues with shoptlifting/theft but as we're in a pretty affluent town, our losses aren't too bad, so we don't really have very tight security or anything (no LP, we can't stop/pursue/detain thieves, etc). 

Anyway, I'm working the dressing rooms trying my best to help a very nice younger woman put some outfits together (I know nothing about womens' clothing yet my manager continues to put me, the only male employee, on the womens' side) when another woman, much older, asks for a dressing room to try on a couple things. I open a room for her and ask her if she needs any help. She asks me if I would get her another jacket in another size. Sure thing, no problem. 

When I get back to the fitting rooms with the jacket, I notice the older woman is poking around the fitting room the younger woman was using (she was out on the floor looking for shirts or something). I peered in closer and noticed the woman going through/looking at the younger woman's purse. I approach her:

Me: Excuse me ma'am, what are you doing?

Old Woman: Oh. I was just getting...my bag. I love this shirt. I think I'll buy it.

Me: This isn't your fitting room and that isn't your bag.

Old Woman: Excuse me? Of course it is, what are you saying?

At this point I'm irritated, confused, hungry, tired, and not in the mood for games. Then, out of nowhere comes the younger woman.

Younger Woman: Hey! Who do you think you are? Trying to steal my purse and give this nice boy a hard time? Scram!

Older Woman: I...I-

Younger Woman: I said shoo!

And with that, the old lady fled the store. Purse lady, wherever you are now, thank you for handling this situation better than I probably would have.

Edit: To clarify, the older woman was probably 70-ish while the younger woman was in her forties. So not young per se, but much younger.","Excuse me, that isn't your bag",1218,talesFromRetail
RedRing14,87,,285,1pq91s,,1002,"Hello again TFR.  Yesterday I posted about the one day I completely lost my cool and went super saiyan.  Wall of text in coming.

Background again just in case.  I worked at a game reselling store that was connected to a movie rental place.  It was one of and will probably be the best job I had.  Started there on my 18th birthday (had to be 18) and was basically (and for a short time was) managing it on and off. 

Alright so at my store I had tons of regulars and got to know them pretty well.  Some of them became a family away from my actual and my work family.  Even today some 4 years later I still see them and we talk like we saw each other just yesterday.  There was one customer named jason who came in often with his grandma.  He never bought anything and was just happy looking.  If he did ask to buy something his grandma said it would be too hard for him.  He would talk to me from time to time and tell me about his sonic game and how he loved to play it but had beat it numerous time (sonic 1 on genesis).  I always thought if he could play that then surely anything he looked at on ps2 was going to be just fine.  One day his grandma pulls me to the side. 

Gma: We come in here a lot and jason has decided to call you a friend.

Me: That's good.  He's a really good kid and I enjoy him coming in.

Gma: I notice you never asked why we never buy anything and I respect that.  Jason has autism so the games are just to hard for him to learn the controls.

Me: Oh I see.  Well I won't say anything to him about it and you know you guys are always welcome in here and we will help as much as we can.

Fast forward a couple of weeks on a monday afternoon where  we are usually dead as all get out.  Day before game releases were very calm.  I only needed one other person and they were already on the clock when in comes jason and his grandma.  They look around and jason sees a game that he wants more than anything I've ever seen him look at.  Legend of spyro for the PS2.  His grandma told him it would be way to hard.  The look on his face when she said that pulled on every heart string I had.

I pulled his grandma to the side while he looked at the game and asked how long they thought they would be in the store.  She said until she got tired and then they would go grocery shopping at the store at the end of our strip.  So I ask if I can put the game into the demo unit.  She was hesitant at first but decided to go ahead and let him.  About an half hour into the game he is starting to get upset and she starts to get tired. I put my office chair near her to sit down and start talking to jason and kinda walking him through how to play.  Another hour goes by and he is getting the hang of it but she decides to go shopping.  I convince her to let him stay and pick him up whenever she is done which she agrees to do.  

He is loving the game and I can see it.  He has a look on his face I've seen all to many times.  While he is playing I tell my coworker to leave him alone and I'll be right back.  I walk over to the grocery store and find her.  I ask her if she has any problems with him getting the game.  She says she doesn't really want to buy the game if he can't play it.  I ask again and she gives the same answer so I tell her not to worry about that I'll take care of it.  She agrees although hesitantly.

I go back to the store and look up the barcode for the memory card he is using and the one for his game and ring them up.  Use my extra store credit from my old non employee account I never was bothered to put on a gift card and finalize everything.  She comes in and he gets really sad that he has to end the game.  I go to turn it off and when I do I eject the game, take the memory card out, and put them together in the case with the receipt.  He doesn't understand at first and starts to put the game back on the case so I go out from around the counter and tell him to open the game case.  In that second I see the happiest expression I have ever seen.  He runs to his grandma who is now visibly choked up about it and shows her.  She is speechless but manages to say ""That's amazing jason"".  He walks over to me and says ""Thank you redring14, I will beat this game just like you showed me"".  He then gave me a hug which made his grandma and I break out into tears.  She takes him out of the store and they left.  Later that night I get a call from her saying he has been playing the game all night (4 hours if I recall) and is loving it.  I explain how happy I am and tell her if it gets to be too much to bring the game in and we can switch it out or I can show him how to progress through that part.   About 2 weeks later he came in and bought the second game and apparently had been doing extra chores to be able to buy it.  

I see them every now and then.  Jason has been doing a lot better in school lately and is still gaming.  Gaming has allowed him to make connections and friendship with people.  He always is happy to see me and always gives me a high five and sometimes still a hug.  This kid is honestly the best thing to come out of retail for me so far and I am so happy to have worked that day with him.  To watch him go from the 8 year old who couldn't really play any games to a kid who is now understanding just about any game you put in front of him.  To see how that experience made something where he could relate learning with his autism and make it basically non existent now.  Every year I get a Christmas card from his grandmother and him and every time I am told what game his is playing and its always got something about spyro on it even if its just the picture of spyro sitting on their fireplace.  They go in my bank lock box so that nothing happens to them.

lodged_in_thepipe,31,,304,1ptcjt,,990,"First off, I don't technically work in retail, I work in a large city center pub in the UK. This incident was quite amusing though so I thought I'd share.

On the weekends we have live music playing on the ground floor, which means beforehand we have to move all the furniture out the building so there is room for people to watch the band, dance etc. When the bands finish we have to move it back in, which is sometimes made tricky by the fact the pub is now full of drunk people who don't like being asked to move out the way.

At this point me and my coworker had moved about half the tables in, and were carrying another one through the main door. However, when I opened the door I found the entrance blocked by a girl who was dancing for a group of guys the other side of the room. She looked pretty drunk, and was clearly trying to look as sexy as possible. I said ""Excuse me"" politely, but she either didn't hear me or ignored me. I repeated myself louder, and she glanced at me but still didn't move aside.

At this point I was just preparing to push past her but then something better happened. Right behind her was one of the long tables we'd already moved in, and she began to 'seductively' slide on top of it, seemingly attempting a '[Jessica Rabbit on the piano' look](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/196/2/e/jessica_rabbit_by_amalara-d57e0ay.jpg) for the boys. However, in her inebriation she slid onto the very edge of the table, which straight away sent the table flipping over and her tumbling onto the floor. She wasn't hurt, just drunk and confused and mumbled some apology to me before moving out the way. I said it was fine and went through the door with a huge grin on my face.

She approached me to ask to use the phone and I told her to just let me deal with the person i was ""helping"" and i will help her out. She was cool with that but apparently the customer I was dealing with didn't appreciate this and started calling me names. from the corner of my eye I saw massive purse come swinging towards the customer and just smacks him right on the face. i was stunned as I could only see this little old lady just going to town on this dude yelling at him about being an asshole and just screaming out obscenities to the dude. All he could do was avoid the purse and eventually just left.

Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

CB: You said you would pay cash to get my car fixed

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  We get our fair share of Spanish speaking customers at my location, and I try to have at least one cashier working that can speak Spanish, just to smooth things along. I don’t speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish). I was actually busy trying to stock one of the shelves at the time, so I shook my head no and held up one finger for the universal “one moment” sign. I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

About 10 minutes later, the two guys are shopping on the aisle across from where I was stocking, and talking to each other in Spanish. I’m really not paying much attention to them, when I thought I heard one of them say something like “She’s at the table, put it in the bag.”

I walk around the aisle, and one of the guys is holding a brick of firecrackers in one hand, and a large shopping bag from a different store in the other hand. I look in the other direction, and my cashier is at the front register checking someone out.

I walked up them smiling and said, “Bastardo barato, get out.”

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

One of my good friends, TC (AKA Drunky the Bear), works on a talk radio station in Orlando. It's actually the top rated station, and I do a lot of advertising with them. He's also the guy I blew up in the Porta Potty in [this](http://redd.it/1m5ca2) video. 

I mentioned to him that the media we're going to come by and interview me, and he said he would swing by to watch the fun and pick up some stuff. TC shows up, and I show him around and point out some of the new stuff I was carrying.

The news station arrives, sets up their equipment, and we do a quick interview. I answer their questions and talk about how great fireworks are, how everyone should be safe, blah blah blah. The reporter then asks me if it would be okay for him to interview people shopping at my tent. 

Of course, who do they walk up to first?!? The guy with the shaggy hair, baggy shorts, and flip flops wondering around my tent, my buddy TC. 

**THE CON**   The reporter introduced us, and we acted like we had never met each other before. I walked away so they could get started. I knew it was going to be a good interview when the last thing TC whispered to me was, “Should I take off my shirt?”

I think TC ranted for a good 3 or 4 minutes in his best stupid redneck voice. I can’t actually remember all of it, and a few times, I had to walk away because I was laughing so hard, I was afraid the camera would pick it up. Here are a few of the more memorable quotes. 

* Fireworks are as American an America, even though the Chinese make em.

* If you don’t buy fireworks for the 4th of July, you’re probably a communist.

* I always come to this store to buy my fireworks because they have better fireworks than China.

* I spend thousands of dollars every year on fireworks. I like fireworks more than I like my family.

and Finally

* When I set off my Fireworks, I want the astronauts to see them from space. I want God to look down from heaven and say that was good stuff.

I think I actually saw the reporter get wood during the interview. Here are some [photos](http://imgur.com/a/vBotR) of the interview. We both made the early broadcast of the news. I think they included maybe 10 seconds of my interview, but TC, he got PLENTY of airtime. I don’t think they played it again during the later news broadcasts. I have the feeling that someone from the newsroom recognized TC, and they realized that they’d been had. 
 Amazingly, I’ve never been called by that news station for an interview since.

My friend TC actually does a free weekly podcast with another of my friends, Daniel Dennis (Double D!). I seriously think it’s one of the funniest things on the net, and if you like my type of humor, I’d invite you to check it out [here](http://www.tomanddan.com/).

They also have a premium BDM (Big D*ck Millionaire) membership with bonus stuff. If you do decide to become a BD member, check out the premium Podcast from around NYE of last year. They did a drunk podcast from my fireworks tent. 

I don’t have any affiliation, other than they’re my friends and I think they’re funny as shit. I’ll buy the BD membership for the **FIRST** person that comments and specifically asks for it.

crime_and_oats,73,,207,16cx1c,,981,"Working at my part time retail superstore job for a couple years now, I get to know most of the regulars...

There was this elderly couple who I starting recognizing from only a few weeks in from starting there. It wasn't too difficult since they would try to talk to most employees before they even started shopping (they especially wanted to get to know me, the new guy), always brightening up our otherwise dull Sunday morning. They'd come in around 10:30 every week holding each others hand and smiling, presumably after church or breakfast, and crack incredibly well witted responses to whatever we were conversing about. We'd share stories, their's much more intriguing then any of ours could ever be. They'd ask how each of us how we were doing, how whatever they heard us say last week turned out, etc. They simply cared. Him with his slouching posture, dated 1980s glasses with tinted red lenses, and bald top with gray hair surrounding underneath. Her with perhaps a tacky floral purse by today's standards, dyed blondish hair that fights off the grays, and one of those faces you can easily tell how beautiful she was without the wrinkles (not saying she's horrid with the wrinkles, but). They were probably the most well treated customers we ever had and possibly will have, since they were the customers that treated us the best. I even requested to work Sunday mornings.

Once our conversations and the laughter died down, theyd say something along the lines of ""we'll catch ya in a few"" and then told one another where they were going and to meet back here (the customer service desk) in 15 minutes-usually giving each other a quick kiss on the cheek before parting ways. He went for the groceries (mostly for beer and junk food) or hardware, she went for the cosmetics, clothing, or health products. Each with their own shopping cart going separate ways down the waxed floor. One of them would sometimes over extend the 15 minute time frame, leaving the other waiting in-front of the desk. Not that either of them minded, plus there were magazines they'd read. Once re united they'd combine their goodies into only one shopping cart, and if the goodies didnt all fit into one they would compromise on what to give us back (he usually had to compromise a bit more than she did). A sort of old timer budgeting. They'd check out, and if they bought candy or other goodies theyd rip open the bag and give some to their cashier. Said their goodbyes and seeya next weeks, and leave as they entered...holding hands and smiling, but this time sharing the burden of pushing a cart.

About six months into this job, I started noticing a decline of health in both of them. They just didn't seem themselves. We'd ask how they were doing, giving us a ""just fine"" being more concerned about how we were doing. The misses started forgetting things more. He'd ask if she got insert product here, and she would either say ""oh no"" or ""I don't know."" The mister moved slower and slower.

Jump to 3 months later, cue sad music.

Her other half didn't walk in with her. An empty hand. A not so big smile. Oh, maybe he's just busy or something. Hopefully. She talks to us, her I'm guessing alzheimers clearer than ever. She starts repeating things. Something clicked and she decided it was time for her to go shopping. 15 minutes pass and she shows up to the front of the service desk. Flipping through magazines, waiting for him. How the fuck do we tell her she didn't walk in with him? How do we tell her that she forgot? We don't know. Then a new cashier a few minutes later, oblivious to who this woman is, asks if she's ready to check out. She says ""oh yes, sorry."" She said oh yes sorry! She's checking out! A weak sigh of relief.

The rest of the week I thought about her. About them. I convinced myself that he'll walk in with her, his hand in hers, smiling, next Sunday. I was wrong. She does the same routine as the last Sunday. She waits for her missing husband. Goddammit, I was on the verge of tears.

4 Sundays pass. The hope of the week of thinking about them diminishes. She persists with the same routine. She waits. She waits until someone or something tells her its time to check out and go, her husband isn't coming. Why must she wait?

I request Sunday mornings off. I ask a coworker that worked my first (the next) Sunday morning I had off in awhile about her. ""She didn't come in"" the fucker said. ""You sure? You know who I'm talking about right?"" ""Ya dude, she didn't come in.""

And so, for some stupid reason Ive asked, and still ask, if either one of them came in the previous Sunday of every week since then and get the same ""no"" every-time. Every fucking time. The most humblest, modest, nicest, caring, loving, and I'm sure plenty of other adjectives that are beyond my vocabulary- couple I have ever had the chance to meet are missing. And now I'm the one waiting.

Dammit.

Broken001,84,,245,1l304k,,974,"This is my first post. I used to work overnights at a popular gas station here in the Bible Belt. I am not from this part of the country, mind you. Also, it should be noted that I worked alone.
Anyway one quiet night 2 20 something's come in at around 3-4 am. The van they ride up in is in terrible shape. No front plate one headlight out etc. As I'm doing my regular cleaning they are wandering around, I keep my eye on them and realize both have filled soda cups twice since arrival. On top of this I see they are stealing WWJD wristbands and necklaces and shirts. These are 10$-20$ a pop. I note it for my manager to look into on video the next day.
They come up to pay for the drinks they have having been very sketchy and asking for all kinds of free handouts, I was already on edge and ready to see them go. I ring them up for 2 sodas plus 2 refills each. Roughly 3.50$ instead of 2$. They flip out. One lady was black, the other white. Black Lady starts calling me racial slurs and insists on my bigotry due to me overcharging her. I ask them to please leave and never come back. They point out on camera how they stole from me. Lol.
As they leave, the p.o.s. van they have isn't starting and I had enough time to walk around it and record the plate number all while being berated. Van finally starts and they crank into reverse going the entire way out to the road in reverse without turning on the headlights. It's causes someone to hit them. This person is livid and calls the police. Cops show up and ask my statement. I give them the run down and then ask if they had any WWJD stuff on them as they had said they shoplifted it. They did indeed and it was on the list of charges. Sweet justice to me and the cop laughs for a good 5 minutes at the whole thing.
Edit: sorry for spelling. On my phone here.
TL;DR: no free refills, if you're going to shoplift make sure you can get away clean.

TiredRightNowALot,61,,231,1hv7bp,,966,"Okay, so not quite as the title reads... but here's a story from the archives.

I was running a computer store at the time and once a week, there was a meeting of the managers where we discussed changes to the business, things to watch out for in the store, etc.  During this meeting I had invited a few extra people in (I like to bring in associates from all levels of the business, so they can see the managers aren't plotting to fire people, or other bad things).

So, in this meeting we were tight on space, so I moved to the entrance of the room and was leaning against my desk (probably sitting on it, I don't remember that 100%).  We were talking for probably 45 minutes in total when I heard someone getting upset with one of my computer technicians.  I probably had the best team of technicians in the city for their knowledge, customer service and even pricing.  I hear this lady getting quite rude and to the point of yelling, so I excuse myself from the meeting and go out - I don't believe my staff should get yelled at... I get paid for that part of the job though, so here I go...

I come over to the customer and introduce myself, shake her hand and ask her what I can do to help.  She calms down, but then points at my technician and tells me that ""HE BROKE MY LAPTOP"".  Okay, well tell me about how that happened and I will see what I can do.  She proceeds to tell me that the laptop was brought in just to be cleaned, and now there's no information on it.  Everything was erased; all her pictures, all her work, everything.  I agree that this is terribly frustrating, and that I would have to do a little investigating to see what happened.

I turn in front of her and ask my technician what was up.  He explained that the lady brought the laptop in with a malfunctioning hard drive; you know the type... bad sector, read arm scratching the surface.  The drive was unrecoverable, but he went ahead and searched for her receipt, found that she was still under warranty and then phoned her.  He explained what had happened but since she was under warranty, he could replace the drive with one we had from a previous job and she would be fixed next day (typically we order drives in from the manufacturer so that they actually pay for the parts, and the job.  In this case, we didn't get paid because we used one that was considered our stock and also the manufacturer may or may not even reimburse us for labour for this too).

I turn back to the customer and explain that we definitely didn't break the drive; unfortunately the drive was dead on arrival and there would be no way for us to have ever saved her data.  The only option she would have for that would be to send it to a data recovery lab, pay around $1,000 and they MIGHT be able to retrieve it.  I also was able to explain that we did do some things outside of normal policy to speed up the repair, which meant that we straight up lost money to help her out but thought we would get her up and running much faster than normal.

Well, the lady proceeds to lose her shit and accuses us of stealing her hard drive and data (even though she agreed that she could hear the ticking noise of the hard drive before).  I spent another 5 minutes or so trying to reason with her, showing her that her laptop worked now, and even giving her the old hard drive back so she felt more comfortable that we didn't steal her data.  She said she got it, she understood the situation and left.

A couple of days later, we had a complaint in the store against me.  Basically that I didn't even try to help her, I didn't show her any respect, and we were the worst store in the city.  I got the complaint of course since it was my store, and I closed it off.  I record the solution for all of these things and basically just left this one at: customer will never be satisfied, we did a good job.  I made sure to come back and tell the tech that he did an awesome job helping this lady and to continue to be creative in how he solved issues; customer first.

Fast forward two years.  Lady comes back in to the store (she was a semi-regular customer even after the incident) and asks for the store manager.  I come up to the front of the store and say hello... I recognize her and she doesn't recognize me.  She proceeds to complain about a monitor that ""stopped working"" last night.  I take it over and hook it up to a test computer and it works fine.  I let her know and let her see it.  I explain that her video card may be having an issue, or something else.  This was her home desktop, so I ask her to bring it in, which of course she refuses.  I do have people certified (background checks, etc) to go to customer's homes and do work, so I send someone over to check it out.  Video card is dead.  She comes in, buys another, and we go and install it.

Next day she comes back to the store and asks for me again.  I walk up, shake her hand once again and ask what I can do to help her out.  She wanted to say thank you.  She appreciated that I found a way to help her and she was happy for that.  At the end she let me know this...  ""You are very lucky that you did what you did.  The last manager here lost his job because of me!  He stole my hard drive and I phoned the owner and then he got fired.  He was such a terrible manager and when I was having problems, he just sat in that little room over there staring at me and laughing"".

I laughed a little and said ""Well, I guess today is my lucky day"" and then I thanked her and walked away.  She continued to shop in my store up until I left - probably still does now.  She always made a point to say hi, and I always just had to bite my tongue because I wanted to let her know so bad that she was nuts....

TL:DR Lady had some crazy complaint, yelled a little.  Couple years later same lady had a complaint that I fixed again, and she told me that she had me fired two years prior.  Just didn't know it was me.",She got me fired [Long Post]!,1197,talesFromRetail
11Petrichor,167,,311,1ndceq,,963,"So we're in the wonderful time of ""seasonal hiring"". Which means I have to give out applications to anyone that wants one. Enter Surprise Bigot Face Tattoo Man! SBFTM for short. I am doing some manger-y type stuff, actually, I think I was 30 seconds from phoning my DM's boss at that point and letting everyone in corporate have it. But that is another, less funny, more rage inducing story. 

So SBFTM walks up and the following conversation happens: 

SBFTM: Are you guys hiring? 

Me: Yup.

SBFTM: Is it permanent positions or just seasonal?

Me: Just seasonal. All our permanent positions are filled right now. 

SBFTM: Cool! Can I get an application? 

Me: Yeah, give me like 3 minutes because our printer runs on unicorn dreams and jams if you look at it sideways. 

SBFTM: Can you fill it out for me too? 

Me (Complete with ""suck my dick. you aren't funny at all"" face): No. 

SBFTM: But I don't like doing work. 

Me: Then you probably don't want this application. 

SBFTM: Why? 

Me: Because we fucking work while we're here guy. This is a job. 


There were probably lasers shooting from my eyes at this point. Fucking seriously? Come in to my store looking for a job, and tell me, THE MANAGER WHO WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE DECISION ON YOUR EMPLOYMENT that you don't want to do the level of work of filling out the application much less the work we do all fucking day????? Get the fuck out guy, right the fuck now.

As expected, my printer took 4 tries to print the single page job app. SBFTM took this opportunity to save his ass with a joke. 

SBFTM: Why do all the ladies love Jesus?

Me: Um. Jesus is none of my business. 

SBFTM: But why do all the ladies love him? 

Me: I have no clue, because I don't know anything about Jesus. 

SBFTM: Because he's hung like this!!!!!! ROFLCOPTER 11!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHALAWL

SBFTM spread his arms out as if on a cross. You know the dumb ass joke, and you know on how many levels that's not the joke you tell to get a job. So before I have even printed his application, he's not getting the job. Ever. In a million years. But I print it anyway, hand it to him and expect him to leave. Nope. He needs a pen. Because if he ""doesn't fill it out now, he'll forget and never will"". YOU TEASE ME SBFTM! 

About 45 minutes passes. I forget about SBFTM. But he comes back, with the app, no pen (steal a pen from me and still want me to hire you? Might be super petty at this point but I had my mind made up about him and hated him at this point.) and a NEW JOKE!!! 

SBFTM: How do Germans tie their shoes? 

I respond with no more than a raised eyebrow and an ""Are you fucking kidding me right now"" face. 

SBFTM: IN LITTLE NAZIS!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I about-faced, grabbed my biggest marker, and wrote NO on his app before putting it in the reject pile. ","No guy, that's not how you get a job. In fact, it's the exact opposite.",1274,talesFromRetail
AsshatMcBallsasaggin,111,,223,1n2ydc,,966,"Tonight I stopped by a popular sandwich shop to grab dinner on my way home.  I walk in &amp; things are semi-busy, there's a few people in line ahead of me.  One group in particular consisted of a couple women &amp; their kids.

These kids were absolutely horrible!  There were 4 of them, all probably around 5-8 years old &amp; they were jumping on the tables, knocking around chairs &amp; running around.  Knocking bags of chips off the racks- just being little terrors.  The 2 youngest girls were running around the restaurant screaming at the top of their lungs.  You know the scream- the really high pitched one that makes your butthole pucker.

Anyways- neither one of these women seemed to be phased by this at all.  They just kept on chit-chatting while pretty much everyone else in the building daydreamed about setting these people on fire.  People were literally having to scream their orders at the workers behind the counter just so they could hear them.  It was **THAT** loud in there.

So, it's these ladies turn to order &amp; the woman says ""Can I get a blad-di-blah sammich"" and the girl behind the counter looks her dead pan in the face and says, ""What? I'm deaf now.""

Hey everybody! I've posted over here twice and got quite some good feedback and I've decided that I would post about finally being able to kick my ex-boss out of the new store!

Here are my old stories about my boss. If you haven't read them, you may want to read them to get some background.

[6 stories from my old boss](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1lsrqu/the_boss_to_end_all_bosses/)

[My boss doesn't like service dogs](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1mdzhi/my_boss_and_service_animals/)

So, after leaving my job with my horrible boss of almost a year, I found a job in the other grocery store across town. This new store that I worked at was a discount grocery store; which basically means that we would get overstock from other stores, stuff that didn't sell, outdated items (not insanely outdated, we still had some standards on the food we could sell), etc, etc.

Anyways, we would still order regular stuff from the vendors and since we would usually buy some of their overstock and outdated stuff as well, we would get a little bit of a better deal on whatever else we bought. Getting a better deal, meant that we could pass on some of the savings to the customer.

My old boss would occasionally send some of the managers from the other store in to scope out our prices so that they could see if they could beat it and sell more than we could. Normally, my new boss ""Ralph"" wouldn't mind, he would always just let it go. Eventually, he started to get a little upset about it and told me to ask them to kindly leave. I had been hoping for this every since they started coming in and scoping prices, so I went out to 2 of our assistant managers ""Paul"" and ""Larry"", and I kindly asked them to leave.

Before I move on, here's a little background on the two grocery stores I worked at.

The first one (AKA the one with the horrible boss), was a chain store, therefore, anybody below a manager really had no power whatsoever.

The new one (AKA the one with the better boss), was only three stores, and the owner of the stores wouldn't really take much crap from others, so we had quite a bit more power than I used to have.

Anyways, they inform me that I'm not allowed to tell them to leave since I'm not a manager and that anybody can shop in there. I laugh and tell them that my manager had told me to ask them to leave, and that if they didn't, I would call the police to have them escorted out of the building. They leave without more incident, I'm happy since these 2, along with Mike made my life hell for the past year. I go about my job (warehouse attendant), and start running the forklift and trying to rearrange the warehouse.

I get called up front to go carry out some groceries for an older lady, and as I walk back in, who else would show up? It's lovely old Mike! He asks me why I kicked out his two managers, and I informed him that if they wanted to come actually shop here, they were at perfect liberty to do that, but if all they were going to do was scope out prices so they could beat it, then they were not allowed back in the store. And if he was going to cause trouble, he can not even enter the store.

I turn my back on him, walk back in, and tell our checkers to call me if Mike comes in and starts trouble. I go to the back, and not even 60 seconds later, I get a call from my checkers telling me that he's scoping out prices as well, and that my boss Ralph was gone, and they wanted me to take care of it.

I walk out from the back, see Mike write down some prices from something and approach him.

Me: Mike, if you're going to be scoping out prices, you can leave now too.

Mike: You're not a manager, I don't have to listen to you, and you can't even kick me out anyways.

Me: My boss gave me permission to kick out anybody from (Old store name here) if they're just going to come here and scope out prices. I can tell that's what you're doing so you need to leave.

Mike: I'd like to see you make me.

Me: I'll give you about 10 seconds to start walking to the door and if you don't, I'll call the police to escort you out. 

10-15 seconds go by where we just glare at each other with as much contempt as we can manage.

I pull out my phone and call the non-emergency line for our local police department.

PD: This is (City name) police department, non-emergency line, how may we help you?

Me: Hi, this is Bravesfan417, I'm over at (new store name), and I have a customer here who's causing troubles and that we have asked to leave, but he won't. Can I get somebody over here to help please?

PD: Bravesfan417? I hadn't seen you over at (old store name) in a while! I was wondering where you were! Anyways, it's a small town, who is it? Maybe we can just talk to them on the phone to get them to leave.

Me: It's Mike from (old store name {OSN}), and he's scoping out our prices, my boss has given me permission to kick anybody out from that store who is just coming over to scope out prices, and that's all he's doing, so we would like him removed.

PD: Yeah... Normally for something like this, I would just ask the person to leave from the phone, but Mike was being an ass to my wife the other day. I'm on my way.

5-10 minutes pass by where I help out a few customers while Mike scopes out more prices. Police show up, the cashiers tell him where I'm at, and we walk over to Mike.

PD: Mike, you've been asked to leave. You need to leave. Technically, you're trespassing.

Mike: This is a free country, I can go where I please.

PD: Unfortunately, you've been told that you're not allowed on these premises, therefore, no, you can't go where you like. Leave, or I'll escort you out with handcuffs.

Mike: Do you think you intimidate me Officer ""Jones""?

To clarify, Mike is between 6'3""-6'6"", and 250-275 lbs (190.5-198.1cm, 113.5-124.9kg), while our officer is roughly 5'10"" and 175 lbs (177.8cm and 68.1kg).

PD: Mike, I'm going to ask you once more, and then if you don't leave and try to intimidate me more, I'll taze your ass, you'll piss your pants, and I'll drag you out. I've had enough of your shit. Let's go.

Mike looks at the tazer on the cops belt, gives both of us the dirtiest look he can come up with and leaves.

We both crack up laughing, and the cop ends up giving me his direct number. Neither of us like Mike, and he wants to be the one to deal with him if anything should arise again.

I'm sorry for all of these stories being so long, I remember quite a bit of detail from them, and I don't believe that I would be doing these stories any justice if I were to leave anything out!

**TL;DR** Got my old boss kicked out of my new store. It felt AMAZING!

JacOfAllTrades,49,,195,189d22,,965,"This is a tale of the sixty-somethings. Let me explain: for some reason, in about 25% of women, when they hit the age of sixty they decide they are the end-all-be-all of interior decorators, and if you say a word about it, they will slice you down faster than a fat kid with a katana will take out a straw mat. Them's some bitches. And now the tale.

We had in the store shopping two sixty something women (Cranky Bitch and Momma Timid) as well as the husband of one of the women (Papa Timid). Now Momma Timid had picked out a vase she liked as well as some branches, so Papa Timid took them to the cash and asked me to check him out. I rang him up, bagged everything, and he smiled brightly, looked to his wife and said, ""I got them for you! Now you can decorate the livingroom!"" Cranky bitch snapped her head around and hissed, ""We aren't *finished*!""

This is when I knew this would not go well. But nonetheless, smile and be helpful, ja? Well Cranky Bitch's idea of design is make it all match! All! ALL! **ALL!!!** Needless to say, we were not going to see eye to eye. Cranky Bitch would make a recommendation, then Momma Timid would look to me and ask, ""What do you think?"" The vast majority of the time I said basically, ""Well, eclectic is going to be better than matching, because that way if anything fades or you decide to add something, it won't be obvious.""

Cranky Bitch's usual reply to me stating my opinion: ""Well what do you even know about it!?""

Um, quite a bit... I completed two years of interior design school, what did you do? Nothing. I do this on a daily basis to the tune of thousands of dollars. What do you do? Decide you're right and yell at people.

Papa Timid, I suppose feeling sympathetic, whispered in my ear, ""Just go stand behind the counter. We'll buy stuff, then return it when Cranky Bitch leaves and have you help us for real."" While I would much prefer a world where people have spines, this is fair enough, so I went back to the cash to wait for a final purchase. Cranky Bitch proceeds to stack 4 orange candles, 2 orange vases, 9 orange flowers, and 2 orange pillow covers on the counter. She thoroughly examines the candles and notes tiny dents and dings and differences between them and exclaims they simply will not do! ""The candles are hand-carved and painted... they're going to be imperfect.""

CB: You just have an excuse for everything, don't you!?

Me: No, ma'am, I'm stating fact. If you don't like them, don't buy them.

CB: Whatever! Hold this up *pointing to a pillow cover* so we can see it!

...seriously? It sitting right next to the things you want to compare it to isn't good enough? Fine... I held it up about chest level.

CB: No! Up! Up! Like this! *she demonstrated by holding her hands at the sides of her head*

Me: I'm not doing that.

CB: Your job is to help me and do what I say!

Me: No, ma'am. I am not holding a pillow cover over my face. It's a loss prevention issue, and I'm not going to degrade myself for you.

CB: You need to shut up and do what I tell you to do!

Me: No, I don't.

Now here is where I should point a few things out. There were only three of us running the store, the GM, me, and a base-level stock worker. Ideally that would mean me covering the door at the front of the store, the GM covering the door at the back of the store, and Stock working stock (obviously), BUT our large furniture storage is in the basement of the mall, and base-level stock workers don't have a security code to access it. We had a customer show up to pick up his table and chairs, so the GM left me his manager keys, and went down stairs to load the furniture, leaving me at the front of the store and Stock at the back of the store. Stock has worked for us for two weeks and has no idea how to run a register, he was standing there for LP reasons only, and was to send any customers up to me. And this is why all of that matters...

CB: You will do what I say or I won't buy anything from you!

Me: I won't be selling you anything today.

CB: Excuse me!?

Me: I refuse to help you. You're welcome to wait for another cashier, but I will not be helping you.

CB: I'll tell your manager!

Me: Please do. He'll come up here the second he gets back in the store (this is true, I had his keys).

CB: You can't refuse to help me!

Me: I can. And I did. We're done talking.

She tried screaming a variety of theoretically insulting things at me (ie ""You think you're smart!"" ""Nobody likes people who are obstinate!"" etc), then tried to get Stock to ring her out. Stock, of course, told her I was the only cashier and he couldn't help her. He informed her that the GM would be back at some point and he'd send him over. Meanwhile, I checked out other customers, which only enraged CB more and more. I welcomed her to sit on a sofa and wait for the GM, but that I was not going to help her. All-in-all, she waited 45 minutes for the GM to come back and ring her out. She told the GM I was crazy and cussed at them, called her names, blah blah blah. He didn't speak until he handed her the receipt and said, ""None of that is true. Now don't come back to my store until you can treat my employees like people."" Her jaw hit the floor, I swear. Papa Timid giggled, and Mama Timid fought a smile.

True to his word, Papa Timid returned about 2 hours later and returned everything CB had picked out. Mama Timid came in about ten minutes later and I helped them pick out pieces that would liven up their living room and kitchen for spring. I did ask, though, how they would explain to CB what happened to the things she picked out.

MT: Oh, that's easy. I have her dog at my house, so I'll just say he destroyed everything and ask her to pay for it.

I kept my composure, but I was dying with laughter on the inside.

only1mrfstr,38,,229,1k3r1y,,953,"I made my first TFR post yesterday and it went over quite well (though I fully blame my side tangent rather than the main topic... lol) so I thought I would share this story.  It comes from my fast food days, long ago first-job kind of stuff.  The first job I had which I stayed at much, much too long.  

So... I started working for a burger place, one of the well-known international places... not the top dog, but you've definitely heard of this place.  Anyway, after a couple years I was an assistant manager so, of course, when problems arose I got to deal with it.    I can honestly not remember what year this happened, what time of year... any of that... best I can say is mid-90's (say 95-97 just for good measure).  

It hadn't been a terribly slow night, nor busy... just your average night slapping together processed beef patties and fake cheese.  It was a bit later in the evening... around 10pm.  We had the tail end of a rush when a rather large order came through.  I believe it had come through the drive through.  Easily 10 different meals (really, who goes through the drive-thru for that much food??? people who never worked fast food... that's who!).  Of course, each and every meal was to be made different: with cheese, without cheese, no pickles, extra onions... you get the gist of it.  


OF COURSE!  flash forward about 15 minutes and the phone rings.  cue up the irate customer, Drive-Thru Guy (DTG, lets call him).  Well, he starts yelling and screaming and saying we made everything wrong.  I remember listening on the headset how he ordered and helped make the food.  We didn't get it wrong from how he ordered it.  Not one bit... guaranteed.  Regardless... he says everything is wrong and starts laying demands on me.  

""The people at my office work hard and are pulling an all-nighter!  We can't be bothered by this incompetence!!!""  

around this time he starts telling me where I can deliver the remade order.  Um... yeah, besides not having the technology to deliver, we can get in serious trouble for that.  I make up something like it's against the store insurance policy to allow employees off-site while on the clock (it may be true, may have heard it and blurted it out... or just something I pulled out my ass).  Amazingly, he accepts this.

""Look, DTG, here's what I'm willing to do for you.  You come on back down, I will have your entire order remade and ready for you when you get here.""  

He tells me the entire order again, we go over each meal to make sure we are on the same page.  Me and my kitchen guy work on the food and as it's just about done I hear a banging on our lobby door.  Our dining room has closed at 10pm so just drive-thru was open.  (I know this is pretty common practice now but back then we were one of the first stores in my area to do it after an attempted robbery)  I go up to the door and tell the guy the lobby is closed, he says he's DTG so I go ahead and let him in.  Yeah, I could have gotten in trouble if the owner drove by or whatever but the guy had a huge order and seemed pretty pissy so I was going to try to appease him as best I could within my control.  He comes in, I let him know we are bagging up the last of his order.  Amazingly, he brought the ""messed up"" food and left it with us.  He was still acting kind of dickish but I did my best to be as nice and professional as possible.  If he was going to undoubtedly complain, he couldn't say one word about our customer service being rude.  

So, food is packed up, I've read every item, looked to show it was marked to have been made exactly as I wrote down and compared notes with his so that we knew each and every meal was right. He says all of them look right, so it gets all packed again.  Right before he picks up his bags I hand him a few coupons for free meals and apologize for the inconvenience, and offer my hand to shake.  Now... DTG had an attitude the entire time, practically sneered and probably just expected the worst out of some punk fast food kid... but what I just did flabbergasted him.  He looks to the coupons, looks to me, shakes my hand and thanks me... the first time in our dealings I felt he wasn't completely looking down on me.  I let him out the door and send him on his way.

fast forward a few weeks, and someone at the drive-thru window asks for me by name.  I go up and who is it but DTG.  He thanks me again for the service I had given him that night and even apologized for the way he acted.  

Over the course of the next few years I saw him at least once a week and most times he would ask for me just to say hi.  At one point he gave me his business card and said if I had any interest in a different career to give him a call.  I forget what that was but I remember it seemed terribly uninteresting or just not what I wanted to do so I never did call. 

After a couple years of him coming by weekly, he asks for me by name in drive thru one last time and says that his company transferred him, that he was moving out of town and he thanked me one last time for the service I provided him with and shook my hand.

She probably argued with the cashier for a good 5 minutes, saying ""You're making me hold up the line."" Um, no lady - you're the one holding up the line because you're using a check instead of cash or a debit card. She finished her tirade, and finally gave the cashier the number. She then stated ""I'm going to customer service to complain about this."" The cashier said ""Go ahead, nobody's stopping you. However, it's corporate policy, there's nothing we can do.""

The customer who was behind the old lady commiserated with the cashier &amp; so did I. She grinned at us &amp; said ""The funny thing is, the girl at the service desk can't do anything about it.

smokes666,102,,191,199s08,,959,"I worked at a huge electronic retail store for 5 years. I began as a cashier in a store and worked my way up to District Administration. After multiple staff restructures, I eventually get placed back into a regular retail store.

*Insert awful management here.* 
4 years into my job, I’m over it. I oversaw the store’s inventory and employee schedules. Management was already paranoid that they were being fired thus when I came into the store, paranoia escalated. They started to frame me for inventory discrepancies and schedule errors. (I’d schedule an employee for 8:00am – 4:00pm… after the employee left, management would change it, screwing the employee and then holding me accountable. Management would let an installer leave with a really expensive TV, forget to check the item out, and accuse me of “shrink.”) Several of these intentional mistakes would happen time and time again for a period of 12 months.

One day I was supposed to leave for a very important doctor’s appointment and I had scheduled myself accordingly. Management called our mid-shift who would relieve me and told them not to come in for the day, then proceeded to inform me I had to work a double… “or else.” 

I snapped.

I began to tell every person present to fuck off. Customers, employees, management included. Horrified, my supervisor escorted me to the Admin Office, where I continued my ultimate fuck you rant. “Fuck you. Fuck you. I hate working here. You’re all morons. You make me miserable and I hate working for you.”

I am suspended for 20 days. Finally receive a phone call to come back to the store, where I am greeted with a termination letter and a final check. Ok. I apply for Unemployment.

Rejected… on the basis that I willingly quit my job.

Incorrect.

Request my employee file from HR.

Lo and behold, Management forged my signature on a voluntary separation notice dated the day I was suspended.

Take fake termination letter and forged signature to court. Me vs. 3 lawyers representing store.

brumbz,103,,195,1ezpzg,,947,"I work at a packing/shipping/office store. One of the many services we provide is that I (and a few other employees) are notary publics. Basically, as a notary all I am doing is looking at your photo ID, verifying you are who you say you are and then witnessing you sign a document. There are other things notaries can do, but that is the most common and basic service. 

So, this frustrated-looking fellow walks into my store looking for a notary. Cool, I can help you with that.. I just need your photo ID. The guy proceeds to flip his shit because he doesn't have any identification on him. I can't understand why he's getting so irate, just go home and get it. But no, he's yelling and cursing and pacing the store, slinging insults to my intelligence and competency because he does not OWN ANY PHOTO ID. He didn't just leave it at home, folks. Since I refuse to notarize his shit without his ID, he storms out - kicking open the door and then making the effort to try to slam it, which is hilarious because it's one of those with the air-pressurized hinges -- you'll push for a solid three seconds before it will close. 

He stomps across the parking lot to his car (from anywhere in the store you have a full view of the 5-spot lot) and just floors the gas as he puts the car into reverse, then leaves skid marks as he peels out toward the exit of the shopping center which is seriously like 20 feet away. Stupid, bro. So then he has to slam on the brakes immediately in order to wait for traffic on the highway so he can take a left on one of the busiest 5-lane roads in a major city. His impatience is obvious as he revs his engine repeatedly. Finally, he snaps. He punches the gas and tries to cut off an oncoming car . Aaaaand he fails. He gets T-boned super hard.

ticklemejimjam,388,,223,16hv6n,,945,"This isn't a personal tale, but one from my sister who doesn't understand the significance of reddit.

My sister works for the Mouse who likes cheese and throws birthday parties for children. I think his name is Chuck or something. Anyway, one afternoon the store received a phone call to book a party. The lady on the phone mentioned there would be 30 kids. A large party but still within the realm of possibility I suppose, so the manager gave her the rundown of the party packages (for pizza, tokens and whatever else). One for $11.99 per child, $16.99 per child and the final one being $21.99 per child. So she ordered the $21.99 package... for 30 kids. There was a $30 non-refundable deposit paid in advance which goes toward the overall cost of your party. The Lady paid that with no problem.

On the day of the party the family showed up with only 17 kids, but used all 30 of the party packages (if you order more than you need and don't use it all they don't charge for all of it) which is no big deal as long as everything is paid for. At the end of their party their host printed out their bill and was a little worried, when it came to $700, that they weren't expecting it to be that high.

Sure enough
Mom: $700!? I thought it was $21.99!
Host: That was $21.99 per child. We explained that over the phone.
Mom: I ain't payin' no $700!

The party host went to talk to the manager who then called the District Manager.
DM: You have to get something from them. Even if you have to lower their bill, they have to pay for the party.

The manager then confronted the party.
Manager: I can cut your bill to the cost of 25 kids but that's the best I can do that will bring your bill to $xxx
Mom: But I only have $3 to ride the bus home.
Manager: Ma'am, You chose a party package that was $21.99 per child, how could you expect to pay that with $3?
Mom: The girl on the phone said it was $21.99 and the deposit was $30!

As it turns out she not only thought a party for 30 kids was only going to be $21.99, but she also thought the deposit would cover that AND she would be getting $8 back!

The police were contacted at which point the party tried get the bus to pick them up and leave before the cops arrived. They threatened the boy at kid check (which is the store's policy to make sure you don't walk off with someone else's child) with violence, because he was slowing them down in they're attempt to make a break for it. Their escape was a failure, the police arrived, the family was taken to court and my sister never found out what happened after that.

This was either the stupidest scam attempt in all of history or the dumbest group of people to ever walk the earth. Sorry for the not-so-climactic ending. The story is second-hand.

TL;DR Lady ordered a party package for 30 kids at $21.99 per kid, put down the $30 non-refundable deposit and expected the whole party to cost $21.99 and to get money back.

That said, all of our stores had multiple entrances. Each of these entrances had large signs with our hours of operation.
One day, after we had finally gotten the last of the customers out the doors (which, as usual, was more than 40 minutes after we officially closed), and we were in the process of counting out our tills, cleaning the store, etc, a call came in on the store line.


Since our policy was that we had to answer calls even after we were closed, I did. Here is the conversation that ensued:

Right now we're very busy with monogramming sheets and towels and shams etc for college kids for their first dorm rooms. A woman came in the store last week to order two pillow shams for her daughter. She is the mother of a guy that I've known since I was 2 years old. She knows me. She doesn't recognize me. That's fine. I'm a natural blonde but I dye my hair a chestnut brown because I think it fits me better. I look different at 21 than I did when I was 3-10, and even at 18.

Me: uh... Because they're deaf? The iPad is in the flyer for $368 but it's ringing up at $468. Why?

CSM: *finds out why* 
the $368 is for the iPod touches.
 
Me: no they're not. I'm standing right beside the touches. The most expensive one is $288. 

CSM: I donno. This couple is hard to communicate with. 

Me: ya man... Because they're deaf. I had no problem. 

So later I got bitched out for costing the company money because they advertised their products wrong. I ended up fighting on behalf of my customer as I saw them become frustrated (I'm now at the customer service desk) because the managers were TALKING to the couple while the couple was trying to signal to the CSM that they couldn't hear.

tiffanydisasterxoxo,60,,270,1ly843,,935,"Back in my deli/bakery days I dealt with a lot of... interesting customers. This story involves a cake. At my bakery if you chose not to get a cake you ordered, we'd take the name off (unless it was an edible image of like you) and just fix the icing and put it on the shelf. We did not discount cakes because someone did not want them. I don't know why that would even be a thing. Anyway... This one day this customer thought they were being slick.
This woman ordered a red graduation cake, didn't get a name just a congrats message. It was a full sheet so it was like 45$. Anyway, this woman came in, looked at the cake and acted very disappointed.

Her: this isn't what I ordered! There is ribbon and sprinkles! I don't want this. I'll just get one from your case. *picks out a cake that was 14.99.*

Our cake decorator apologizes and writes the congrats message on the cake the woman picked out. She leaves, seemingly satisfied. I'm standing in the area right outside the bakery entrance and I see the woman walking back up. She is no longer angry looking.

Her: Hi. I'm looking for a cake for a graduation party. Do you have any returned cakes for a discounted price?

Me: No ma'am, we don't usually discounts cakes.

Her: I want to speak to your manager!

I go and grab my manager and tell her the graduation cake lady is back.

Manager: How can I help you ma'am?

Her: Yes. I just want a cake for graduation, do you have any discounted cakes that people didn't pick up or returned?

Manager: No ma'am. We don't discount unwanted cakes, I'm sorry.

Her: Well I have a lot of people at the party and I need a big cake, are you sure you don't discount returned cakes?

Manager: Yes, I'm sure. I'm sorry. We do have some premade full sheets for 45$ or you can order one for tomorrow.

Her: No, no. It's fine. I don't need it anyway. *huffs off*

Manager: Yes. she didn't even change her shirt... She was just here.

FredFltStn,100,,400,1opx00,,926,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  Like a lot of my customers, I inherited my love of fireworks from my father. I would always wait in gleeful anticipation for the 4th of July to roll around, knowing that we would make our annual pilgrimage to Angelo’s Fireworks in Louisiana. My dad would always set a budget, and I would always convince him to go over it, with Mr. Angelo’s help of course.

As I got older and started to earn my own money, I would always stash some away, waiting for the 4th to roll around. When we went shopping, I would always claim poverty, so dad would pony up the dough. At the last minute, I’d pull out my saved stash so I could get “just a few more things”. 

Now that I’ve opened my own fireworks store, when I’m working and people ask me how I got into the fireworks business, I’ll point to my dad and tell them that it’s all his fault. Every time my dad hears me do this, he’ll shrug his shoulders and claim he has no idea what I’m talking about.

I received a phone call asking about fireworks a couple of days ago. This happens almost weekly, and when it does, I explain that I’m only open seasonally, and refer them to someone else.

The caller is putting on a show to celebrate his wife’s birthday. He was injured while serving in Iraq, and is just plain thankful he’s still around to celebrate her birthday. One of his good friends was not as fortunate. 

Believe it or not, I’ve heard similar stories every year since I started the fireworks company. The stories always make me sad, but I’ve heard them so often, I think I start to unconsciously tune them out. I didn’t want the caller to be disappointed, so as usual, I referred them to one of my competitors that has a store open year round, unfortunately more than an hour away.

I had made my spiel! I was ready to hang up! Then he hit below the belt. He thanked me for the referral, but said he’d have to skip the birthday fireworks, since he wasn’t able to make it to one of the stores on the coast. He assured me that he and his son would stop by my store before NYE to stock up. Since he’d been injured, his son had taken over the lighting duties, and it was one of the things they looked forward to doing together every year.

You bastard.

This afternoon, I'm driving an hour to make a firework delivery. I don’t normally do that when it’s out of season, but I’m making an exception this time. The phone call came from someone I’ve never met, but after speaking with him, I can’t wait to meet both he and his son. [Here’s](http://i.imgur.com/UKwkOkE.jpg) a picture of the load.

gigabyte898,182,,304,1gpne4,,926,"I work at a small game reseller. It is a franchise, but it hasn't really expanded enough to become as reputable as other places. Anyway, since we resell used items (NES, cameras, ipods, etc), my state requires it to be considered a pawn store so I had to wait until I was 18 to work there. I was so exited on my first week, as I had been waiting forever to work there. On day three these kids who were no older than 12 walked in and brought a few M rated games and some pokemon cards. (The pokemon cards were pretty rare EX cards, so they went for about $40 for all of them). They put the M rated games on the counter and I said the usual,""We cant sell M rated games to minors"" rant. One of the kids (he was a chubby one who looked like he was going to do the Truffle Shuffle, so I'll call him Chunk) took out an obviously faked ID and said,""HERE! Take it"". I told him it was a fake and he said to prove it. We have a bill checker behind the counter (shines a UV light on bills larger than $50 to see watermark), so I took it out and put the ID under the UV light. Sure enough there was no watermark in the shape of the state seal on the ID, and I showed the kid. He calmly said okay and asked to see more pokemon cards in a case that was away from the register. Then this conversation followed:  
Chunk: Can I see this one?  
Me: Sure, let me get my key from behind the counter    
I run behind the counter and grab the keys.  
Me: *hands him card* will that be all?  
Chunk: You could also give me those games   
Me: Sir, I already told you tha-  
He pulls out a BB gun and shoots a florescent light above me  
Chunk: I said give me the games  
He then points the gun at me.  
I start smiling. I had a brown belt in karate at the time and disarmed him easily.  
I stepped out of his way, grabbed the wrist holding the gun, jabbed my elbow into the inside bend of his elbow (Which has strong nerve endings that pretty much cause you to drop whatever your holding) and took the gun. The other kids ran out of the store at this point  
Me: Why don't you go sit in the corner.  
Chunk: O-Okay man  
I lock the doors and call the police. They come and lead him out in handcuffs. I don't like admitting it, but I smiled in pure satisfaction as that little shit cried for his mommy.  
After reviewing the security tapes, the store owners pressed charges. As far as I know he got 3 weeks in Juvenile Hall.

Nerflord,49,,182,1bm3ot,,915,"* This is reposted from /r/pettyrevenge. Sorry I didn't think of you first!

I used to work in a 24 hour fast food joint by a popular club. At about closing time (the clubs) we'd get the overflow of drunks. Most just wanted a greasy snack before they went home, and probably 90% were perfectly civil and hilarious.

However, as many who serve the late night drunk crowd know, there are douchebags that seek to bolster their self esteem and social standing, by harassing easy targets (like fast food workers who have to switch off their verbal self defence mechanisms to provide 'good customer service').
We had a regular who would spend his time hitting on customers and staff (me on one occasion) after what was probably another night of disappointment. He clearly thought he was charming.

We named him 'TLE' (The Lynx Effect - after an advertising slogan for a deodorant named Lynx, which is the Australian branding for Axe Body Spray).

TLE would hang out in the dining room, sometimes with a crowd of friends that he would play to. After being politely told to stop standing on the seats, TLE decides he wants a burger, so he orders some monstrosity loaded with a stupid amount of bacon that he expects kudos for ordering (I give kudos for bacon, not wasted bacon).

When it comes time to pay, TLE opens his wallet and finds only a parking ticket and a condom. He hands the condom across and says, 'You accept these as payment, right?' Cue polite laughter.

Without a beat, my surpressed verbal defences kick in.

'Usually, sir. However, not when they've clearly been in your wallet for so long.'

He was stunned, his mates laughed and my manager at the time had to hide in the backroom lest someone saw her game face drop. After that, some lady (whom he had been clumsily hitting on) asked if I accepted tips.

Jozee378,120,,191,1fg31h,,910,"This is a normal rude customer story, with a twist. 

Alright, first off I'm female and just turned 20 when this happened. I got a job at a home improvement store as a cashier and I just finished training on the computers. I was brought out front and put on a register, the first day went great! And by the second day I was able to work at a register on my very own.

Everything was wonderful and I was pretty well trained with cash, credit, checks and giftcards. But a big fat woman came in my line and looked at me in disgust. "" I'm in a hurry, I would like to use cash and write a check for the rest""  I told her to give me a second to call another cashier over to help me. 

"" Are you kidding me? If you're out on the floor like this you should know what you're doing. You're just wasting people's time""  I just call over the other cashier and explain to her that I've never done this. She showed me and the lady wasn't there for more than 5 mins. 

She kept going on about how slow I was and how I shouldn't be out on the floor wasting people's time... Etc. All I said to her was "" Ms, its my second day"" and she just screamed "" yeah, I can tell!"" 

Now here is the interesting part. I went for ice cream a few days ago and in front of me was this obese loud woman. We were in line for a long time ( maybe 20 mins). And she's bitching up a storm to her friend about how she hates waiting. 

So finally she's up to the window and bitching to the poor girl about being too slow and how they don't know how to run the place. I must have let out a loud "" sigh"" because she turned around to glare at me and bitch. 

As soon as I saw that woman's face I saw fucking red. She asked what my problem was and I just said "" all you did was complain about waiting in line, and now you're making me wait to bitch about some ice cream you don't even fucking need"" and she turned red, grabbed her ice cream and walked off.

A couple days ago I had a lady come through my checkout with several cassettes and a few books. I was a lil excited at first because she had sorted them making thm easier to count. So I rang up the quantity (20) and it came to $10.51. Nbd right?

""Wait! I only grabbed ten dollars worth of tapes!"" The lady angrily accused looking at my screen. 

""Yes you did. You have 20 tapes at $0.49 each. And of course the tax."" Me cheerfully.

""I don't control what is taxed ma'am""

""Well that's a load of b*** s***!""

Now I ring up her books (4 marked at $0.15) and add those to her total.

Minja78,79,,254,1nsjeo,,908,"This from back in my gamestore days.  I had just taken over a new store in less than desirable location.  As this wasn't the first time I had been moved stores, I demanded an inventory for my first Sunday there. The employees were none to happy as they just had an Inventory a few weeks ago and most inventories ran 6-10 hours past close. 

A couple days past inventory I got my results.  We were short about 300 used, GBA (game boy advance) and GBC (Game boy Color) games. Now my first assumption is I missed a drawer of over stock because the list didn't include that many games just bulk quantities of them. 

Tons of research later I found we really were missing 300ish games right about $5000.00.  This discovery immediately removed our store from any employee perks, such as no employee discount and the only reason to work a Gamestore the 4 day video game check out.

Once I informed the staff, no one cared as the only time they  had employee perks was when I first started there a week ago. They all blew it off as the store being in a high theft area and outside of a security guard there was nothing that could be done. They were all clueless as to what was missing and their unified nonchalance to the situation caused me to keep my facts close to heart.  

All the used Gameboy games were under glass and locked up so I surmised this was an internal thing. 

The Plan:  I had a copy of GBC Pokemon with a captured Mew in it. (Stoopid rare at the time as Mew was only in promo copies of the games). We implemented a store policy which would give people more trade in credit if they had a Mew copy.  Well I went on my days off for the week and I had my brother (different last names) trade in my game. I had placed some special markings on the game and had intentions of buying it back when I got back to work.  

When I got back no one mentioned Mew being in the store which was odd cuz we had less rare games produce way more excitement. Well I knew who traded it in and I kept the crews the same on my days off. 

On to the internet I went, ebay was huge back then so it was the first place I tried. I didn't take long to find a mew edition being sold in my region. Believe it or not ebay was less than helpful about supplying me this sellers real name.  So I had a relative from 5 states over buy it and send it to me.  Sure enough it was my copy. I now had the sellers name and address.  It was my fucking assistant manager I had trained this guy about 3 years back and got him promoted to assistant to this store.  GRRRRRRR!!!

Now I had him dead to rights, and maybe the one other supervisor since he traded the game in.  HR and district didn't think this was enough to fire because I used shady means to discover this supposed theft. I had been with the company for 5 years at that point and I was tired of bureaucratic nonsense that corporate was doing.  This was my 5 store they moved me to so that I can fix the inventory problems and I was done. 

So with out corp approval I called the cops.  It took about two weeks for the detective to compile his case, he got a search warrant for house and ebay account. I made sure I was working with the perp when the popo's showed up. I had an employee from the another store waiting in the coffee shop next door ready to work when shit went down.  It was pretty f'n amazing. I called my district manager as the perp was being arrested, she wasn't very happy with me.  He broke almost immediately and the search warrant pulled out about 1500 games totaling about $40k.  

The next day I was fired for unprofessional conduct is what the termination papers said. 

I'm not sure what happened to the thief or his supposed accomplices legally.  I know the store was gutted of employees about a week after I got fired. 

I went to court once about the theft case, it was in a conference room and I sat in front of 10ish people who all asked me a bunch of questions. After about 10 minutes they figured out I didn't work there anymore and promptly stopped asking me questions. 

Unemployment sided with me after it went to court. The judge all but laughed at the district team for firing me. I got about a half a years pay since it took so damn long for me to my UE approved.

Now, John is doing his job excellently, he's ony been at the store for a month so he is a little slow, but all in all he seems to be holding up okay.

Not_A_CEO,180,,226,1rdpxf,,905,"Here's a relatively short tale today, folks.

I've posted here a few times before, and it should bear mentioning that I'm a bank teller and have been for 5+ years.  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a Teller.

I had gone through the mandatory 30-day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors, and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank.  I was technically under the 90 day Probationary stage, but for all intents and purposes I was a full-fledged employee.  Two weeks go by, and I'm steadily getting more and more comfortable.  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes, until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pants.

A customer walks in, hands me his $800 payroll check, and says he'd like to deposit it into his account.  *All right, no problem, here's your receipt, have a nice day.*  He leaves, and that's that.  Or so I thought.  About 10 minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says, ""Hey, Not_A_CEO, did you help this guy a few minutes ago?""

When I acknowledge that I did, in fact, help him with this deposit, my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guy's account and to tell him if I noticed anything ""off.""  So I did...and immediately noticed something wrong.  There's a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current day--I can see if he's been to the grocery store, a gas station, or if he's made any deposits.  Sitting in the Deposit section is...wait for it...a deposit made 10 minutes ago for the nice little sum of $100,000,000.  With my teller signature on it.

Read that sentence above again for me, would you?

**I deposited one hundred million dollars into this guy's account when it only should have been $800 dollars.**

Noticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket, and the words *Ohshitohshitohshit* start to fly about in my mind.  I'm currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me.  He affectionately calls me an idiot, and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount (which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that point).

Turns out, I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section, which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited.  Management thought it was hilarious, and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix, but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on me.

Not my story, thankfully. A friend of mine just told me what happened at her work today, and since she isn't a redditor I thought I'd share. 

So, friend whom we'll call S is a manager at a crappy gas station chain. She has been at her current store for about a month, before that she managed another store of the same chain for over 2 years. She was also the assistant manager at her old store for about as long before the promotion. 

Customer comes in today and asks the clerk if he can break a $100 bill on $15 worth of gas. The clerk explains she doesn't have the change in her till, but if he can wait a minute the manager can come out with enough change. 

S comes out, and as she's walking to the register she stops another employee to tell him to go change the trash outside. Customer apparently overheard her and was offended.

C: Instead of telling him to take the trash out, you could have done it yourself you know.

S: *shrugs and begins counting the change to the clerk* 

C: I thought a manager was supposed to do this. They just let anyone play with the money here.

S: Sir, I am the manager. 

C: *slams his hand on the counter*  You're not a manager! You're a girl!

S: And as soon as you pay you're not a customer. Please don't come back.

Ratava,124,,163,1c012n,,903,"In college I worked at my university's Software Department. It was really more software sales instead of tech help, which is why I think this story fits here. We offered a ton of discounted software as well as a lot of free programs for students, like Microsoft Office, Visual Basic, etc. 

Students used to just hear that you could get free software at our office and would come in asking for ""the software."" We had something like 40 different titles, so when I asked for them to clarify what software, exactly, they would usually just respond, ""You know, the software! Whatever I can get."" I got pretty good at narrowing down what the customer wanted/could use, because I wasn't supposed to just throw all the free software at anyone and everyone. So, people who didn't know what they wanted became less of a problem. But I still struggled with people who most definitely DID know what they were after... except, what they were after, wasn't a real thing.

We moved around a lot while I worked there, and one day, everyone else in the office had gone over to see our new space, so I was the only one at the counter. In walked an Indian girl. (I only mention her race because she had a very, very thick accent and spoke very quickly.)

I stammered something, and she sighed loudly and pulled out an absolutely massive 20-something-inch Dell laptop and thunked it on the counter. The fan on this thing sounded like a motorcycle revving its engine.

She turned the screen toward me so I could watch what she was doing. She opened up Gmail and started a gchat with someone.

HotDog804,62,,176,1fc1vk,,897,"The grocery store I used to work for was completely open to hiring people who had special needs, or were extremely socially awkward. This wasn't a problem and they, just like anyone else, were solid grocery baggers who would chit-chat with customers, bag relatively well, and walk the customers' orders to their cars.  

One day, I'm cashiering a regular customer and talking about the weather, the upcoming weekend, etc. The bagger I had was a girl in her mid 20s who was extremely quirky, but she meant well.  

So this order is piling up at the end of my register and my bagger is moving as fast as she can while trying to include herself in the conversation that myself and the customer are having. She suddenly gets to a loaf of freshly baked french bread and pauses. She looks at the paper bag she is bagging, looks back at the bread, looks at the bag, then back to the bread, and snaps the bread in half, stuffs it into the bag, and continues the rest of the groceries.  

I look at the customer, who then says, ""Is she serious?"" Trying to hold back my laughter, I say, ""I guess so..."", and motion for another bagger to come over and go get a new loaf of bread for this customer.  

After that day, that customer made sure to ask to be handed her bread. She never got mad about it, and we joked about it constantly. It's nice to have customers who can just laugh things off from time to time.",French Bread Solution,1073,talesFromRetail
azuzepher,44,,217,1j0tjy,,895,"Kinda sappy. 

I work at a grocery store where every friday and saturday we give loads of food out as a demo. I was cashiering and it was during the middle of the summer around last year. If I recall correctly everyone was complaining of how hot it was but I hadn't been able to walk outside to get carts yet because we had been so busy. I just took their word for it.

Anyway there was a brief lull in the customers when I see a very old lady walk through the door all in shambles. I mean this lady was old, like: belonged in a nursing home. She came in and sat on the bench and starting whimpering so I sort of hustled over to her and sat next to her. Ill write A for me and O for her.

A:""Whats wrong mamm?"" 

O:""Oh I just had to walk down from Wal-blah to go to the bank but I didnt realize how hot it was until I got to the end of their parking lot""

I gasped because I then realized how far this little old hunch-backed lady had to walk because, true, we are quite close to that store, but for a car maybe. Thats when I figured out she had to have walked at least three. miles. crossed a 4 lane road and walked back up to our store because she was so tired.

A:"" Are you okay? Do you know where you are?""

O: ""oh yes Ive been coming here since I was your age, im near this and this street.""
She was wrong unfortunately because I had never heard of those street names before and the store has only been opened for about 14 years but I just went with it.

A:""Okay, well let me go get you some water. We have food here too,  is there certain things you can eat?""

O:""Oh yes anything.""

I didnt want to trust her judgement but I thought that was important first. So on demo we had chicken poppers with ketchup and I got her a glass of  water. Hey, its food. I brought it over to her and her eyes lit up.

A:""I'm gonna sit by you for a little while is that okay?""
she grabbed the plate from me and it wobbled in her shaky old lady hands and onto her lap where she ate them up kinda quickly. She leaned over and hugged me and I told her if there was anything else I can do.

O:""I have this phone but I dont know how to use it, maybe you can call my daughter."" 

It was an old flip phone so I found her contacts and asked her what her daughters name was. She didnt pick up the first time but I left her a message saying where her mom was. We started to get busy so I was called back to my register.

A:""Is it okay if I go for a little while I have to get back to my register. Im right at number 4 so you'll be able to see where I am, right?"" 

She squinted and nodded so I got up and went to my register. About five minutes later I saw her flip open her phone and lean into the speaker part really hard like she couldn't hear very well. Good news, it was her daughter and shes on her way. Later on she pulled out her wallet and wanted to give me money for helping her but I didn't want to take her money but she did that cute-little-old-lady-shame-on-you-thing and I took a dollar. Later on after she left I bought a water bottle with it and surprisingly it helped me on my way home because my engine was going to overheat but luckily I had this water bottle to pour into the radiator till I got to another store to buy coolant. 

And then later I found out she left her walker up at Wal-blah and requested her daughter get chicken poppers the next time she came back. She is one tough cookie.

redditingnoob,57,,188,1jtltj,,890,"Hi talesfromretail! I haven't been here recently due to work and helping my family open a new restaurant. This story takes place in the new restaurant. In this restaurant I'm the hostess and cashier, while also being my dad's eyes when he's not here and just doing whatever is needed. 

This may be a little long. 

The other day a lady came in, she looked pretty normal and with 2 other women who I assume were just having a lunch. Didnt strike me as odd or anything, I sat her down, gave her the menu, and explained all the specials we had, and told her the waiter would be here soon. 

Everything goes off smoothly I see the waitress bring them their drinks and take down their order. No problems there. Their food arrives about 15 minutes later, again everything is going off smoothly. 

She and her friends finish their meal, and ask for the check. Cool, again this lady seems pretty normal. 

She gets to the register and I ask if her meal was okay. 

Customer: no the waiter wasnt attentive at all, she just looked so bored! The food was dry and just tasted off to me! 

Me: Oh! I'm so sorry about that! 

Customer: But thankfully I know the owner and his family! And he said I could have my meal for me and my friends for free. 

Me: um... I don't have note of that anywhere. *(I know just about everyone my dad knows, and yes he will offer free meals, but will always text me or give me a heads up, with names and descriptions; I will say this lady just didn't look like the type of person my parents would know.)*

Customer: *looks at me and rolls her eyes* Of course you wouldn't know the owner! You know what? I'll just call him!!!

Mentally I want to avoid a confrontation but now I really want to know if she knows my dad. Haha. 

She picks up her phone, and dials some number only to say the line was busy. Weird, my dad never has a busy line. 

Me: oh that's fine I have his number. 

So I pick up my phone and call my dad. He picks up immediately. 

Daddy: hey what's up? 

Me: um.... Can I ask you some questions?

Daddy: Sure? Why?

Me: I have a customer who said you'd give her and her friends a free meal. 

I'm not gonna lie the lady's eyes got huge! Inside I'm laughing. 

Daddy: What does she look like?

I give him a description, he answers he doesn't know her but asks to be out on speaker. 

Daddy: Its okay I can be there in about 15 minutes and settle everything or address any concerns you (customer) may have. 

Customer: um... You know what it's fine I'll just pay and um... Leave. 

Daddy: Okay. Well I hope you (customer) have a great day, sorry about that misunderstanding. Redditingnoob, I'll see you at home for dinner. Love you! 

Me: Love you too daddy! Ciao! 

I can honestly say she looked pale and kind of like an *oh shit* look on her face after I said ""daddy"". She pays and quietly leaves.  

After she leaves the waitress said it was pretty funny to hear her say I probably don't know the owner, considering he's my dad.

Drunken_Black_Belt,128,,232,1aqyy8,,891,"Hey all! So just a quick story for you all. Changing jobs, so probably won't be posting as much anymore, since I tend to stay off the computer when I'm not working.  But anyways, here's a quick story for you.

So about two years ago I went with a friend on vacation. It was right after I had quit *D&amp;B* and was enjoying my first vacation since HS.  On one of our last nights there, my friend decided she wanted to, surprise surprise, go shopping at the outlet stores in the area.  Fine, I could always buy a few things.

So while she's out looking at shoes and handbags and shit, I wander over to the ATHLETIC APPAREL   store. Sorry, that was the best analogy I could come up with.  I wanted to get a few golf shirts, and some rash guards  (compression shirts) for BJJ.  I pick out a few shirts, and head over to the fitting room.  As I'm changing, I hear the door to the tall next to me swing open, and some general rustling noises.  Ok no big deal. That's when I heard an all too familiar sound. *Snip.* *Snip*.  

Well, any LP worth his weight in Reddit Gold knows that is the sound of someone cutting the sensors off of an item.  Sure enough, a few seconds later, a cut tag falls on the floor and lads between the stalls.  A foot reaches out, and kicks it back underneath the bench in their stall.  So I put my shirt back on, having tried on the last shirt I had selected, and walk up to the register. The two associates are sitting there, a male and a female. The female is helping a customer, so I walked over to the male, who we shall refer to as Dumbass #1.

DBB: Hey man. I work LP for another company. I'm on vacation but whoever was in the stall next to me is stealing shit from you.

Now, I have never seen a black man blush before, but this guy did it.  He suddenly looks extremely uncomfortable, looks at his co worker, and back to me, and simply says ""Ok"".  

DBB: Hey man, I don't know your stores policies, nor do I want to tell you to do your job. I'm just letting you know because they are using something to snip the tags, so if you guys do do something, just be careful.

At this point, the female, who turns out to be the manager, is finished with her customer and asks what the issue is.  We will call her Belle, because she was a true Southern Belle. And I'm original like that.

Dumbass goes to open his mouth, but I cut him off and repeat that I'm an LP agent and heard someone snipping tags off of the clothes in the dressing stalls.

Belle: Well what are you standing around for? Go approach them Dumbass#1

Dumbass#1: Ummm....Well.



Well Belle doesn't miss a beat. She marches over to the stalls and starts banging on the doors, saying ""You need to drop your shit and come out right now! Get out here now!""  Dumbass walks over and looks horrified.  I walk over too in case this person decides to take the scissors, multi-tool, or whatever it is they are using, and use it as a weapon.  Frantic rustling is heard, and suddenly a bunch of shirts drop on the ground. The door opens up, and out walks a young male we will call Dumbass #2.  

Now, I'm tense because I don't know what's about to happen.  Guts get cold, body tighten's up.  As comedian Bert Kreischer describes it, ""It's that moment in customs when your asshole gets cold, because they just found the hash on you"".  And it gets awkward quick.  DA#2 is starting at DA#1, and DA#1 is staring at the floor.  Belle's mouth is wide open in shock and is starting between DA#1 and #2. It suddenly feels awkward. More awkward than farting at a funeral. Keep in mind that the other shoppers are staring at us after Belle made a racket.

Belle: Dumbass #2? You MOTHER FUCKER!  *Turns to DA#1*. YOUR BROTHER! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  YOU TOLD ME HE NEEDED TO HANG AROUND BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T HOME! SO I WAS NICE AND LET HIM HANG AROUND! AND YOU'VE BEEN STEALING FROM ME? 

Oh god, it was amazing. The look of pure hatred on her face. The look of shock on theirs.  The look of amazement on the other shoppers faces. It was like Christmas and Hannukah and Kwanzaa wrapped up into one glorious moment. 

 [This was me the whole time](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m884kuqDmT1qem02jo1_500.gif)

Belle turned out to be a smart cookie and didn't let her anger get the best of her.

Belle: Well, you didn't leave the store with these, so I can't charge you. And until I go through all the security tapes, I can't prove you took anything else.  But I think you two should leave. And don't bother coming back unless you come back with whatever you've taken, or the cash equivalent.

DA#1: What about my paycheck?

Belle:  I think we can find a nice charity....

So the Super Dumbass Bros. give one last hateful glance at me, and leave the store.  Belle takes a few moments, apologizes to the customers, and walks me back to the counter. She thanks me profusely, and tells me she'll give me a $100 credit.  So I basically got two golf shirts and two rash guards for free.  I tell her I'm sorry and she says it's not a big deal, and that she should have known. Shrink jumped the moment that kid started working there, and she just ignored it.  We said our goodbyes and I walked out with a few shirts and hilarious story.

**TL;DR- Sorry Mario, but Belle is in another castle**

thebornotaku,55,,131,xnx52,,896,"I work in a grocery store, and we have two big, heavy, grey safes in the front of the store. They are along the front wall of the store, and to either side of them are any manner of customer convenience and items for sale -- we have a microwave, coffee grinders, our cigarette racks, etc. but the safes are right in the middle. It's convenient, because if a checker needs a drop or a loan, the safes aren't more than 20ft away. It's nice.

Well, unfortunately, for children, safes apparantly look like playthings. The top compartment on the right hand safe doesn't close -- the door swings open to reveal a little drop box kinda thing. We call it the drop safe. That's where you put all your pulls, as well as the drop bag at the end of the day. You put it in a little thing, pull the handle to drop it to the lower compartment and all's well. They're nice and secure because the lower comparment needs a combo and a key to open. Only management and GARDA (It's like Brinks) can get in there.

The left safe is similar -- the bottom compartment has an electronic keypad and that's where we keep spare tills and the money for till loans. Only supervisors can get in there. The top compartment is our lost and found basically -- it closes, and even locks but you unlock it by turning the dial to the right. There's no combination.


Well anywho, kids love to play with our safes. We don't like them to, because they have no business to. There's no reason for people to poke around in our safes. So whenever people do, we typically ask them not to. And typically, it's not an issue. Parents will tell their kids to stop and that's that.

Enter today. Some 14-15 year old boy opens the door to the drop safe. He opens it wiiiide open and reaches in and starts playing with the drop thingy (it's a lot like those mailboxes on the street). After he plays with it once or twice, he turns around but leaves it open. He's still standing next to it. I walk up, close the safe quick enough so it makes a nice clack when it snaps shut and look at the boy. ""Please don't play with our safe. Thank you."" Polite, courteous, whatever. No sense in being a dick about it, most people aren't usually rude.

Well, I walk back to my checkstand and this kid is kind of sneering at me. Whatever, no big deal. Then the kid tells his mom something and she walks over. Oh boy. She starts spouting some shit about me not telling her kids what to do and blah blah blah. I tune her out and call my supervisor over. She tells her side of the story. My supervisor witnessed what happened in the first place. His response?

""Do not touch the safe.""

The woman keeps on rabbling about this and that and such and such. My supervisor reiterates:

""Do not touch the safe.""

Again, more rabbling.

""Do not touch the safe.""

Each time he says it, you can tell he's enjoying it more and more. She eventually gets upset at his repetition and starts walking out, still rabbling. He follows her and right before she walks out the door:

""Do not touch the safe.""

We bust out laughing after we're sure she's cleared the door. She was obviously pissed off but my supervisor was definitely on my side. The supervisors usually are, because they all started out in our position and know the kind of shit that happens.

Well, fast forward like 15 minutes. We get a phone call, I answer. It's the lady. She doesn't know who I am. She gives me a brief explanation of the situation (something to the tune of ""One of your employees was telling my child what to do and I don't appreciate that and I wanna talk to their boss"", etc. etc.). I tell her that I'll find the supervisor on duty and transfer her. She seems a little calm, probably thinks that she might talk to somebody who wasn't involved just now.

I put her on hold and tell my supervisor that it's the woman from before. I tell him what she said, etc. He looks at me and says ""I know what to say."" I stand next to him, and he picks up the line. She explains it to him and when she gets done talking, he says one thing:

""Do not touch the safe.""

As he's putting the phone down on to the hook to hang up on her after saying that, I can hear screaming... and we bust out laughing again.

manofmanynames,87,,186,1hqnv0,,892,"This story is from a while ago when I worked at a paintball range and store in country Australia. It was a fairly regular day, around 40 people were out on the ranges playing some good ol' fashioned paintball. I was standing at the front desk, when a couple (now called DC) and their baby came in (the baby was in a small stroller). This is how the dialogue roughly went.

DC: ""Hi, could we get two basic packs to play paintball thanks?""

Me: ""Sure, so which one of you wants to play first?""

DC: ""Could we play together?""

At this point I assumed that another person was with them and on the way into the shop.

Me: ""No worries, providing someone else is coming in to look after your child.""

DC: ""Oh no, it's fine, he can come with us.""

Me: -blank stare- ""Um, excuse me?""

DC: ""He can come with us onto the field, that way we can look over him.""

Me: ""Sorry, the law here is that you must be 16 to enter the field, and besides, your child might get hurt.""

DC: ""How would he get hurt, we're not going to shoot at him! Just let him come in with us, we want to be able to play together.""

Me: ""Firstly, it's against the law so I won't allow you to do it, and secondly are you not worried about endangering his life? Now you can either alternate turns so one of you is here with the little guy, or not play at all.""

DC: ""We wouldn't come here if we knew this was going to happen! For fuck's sake.""

They eventually gave in and took turns playing. It turns out that they called the place later and tried to complain to the owner about me not allowing their child into the field. Some people really shouldn't be parents...

Background Info: I work at a local bakery as an assistant closing manager and close most nights. Because of this it's usually just me and an employee every night till 7pm when we close. The entire front of the store is windows.

As soon as she said it I remembered her. She had actually been here on Friday(two days ago) and had in fact knocked at the door at around 7:05 with a few of her friends. As usual I looked and shook my head at her and mouthed, ""We're closed"" and went back to doing our donations.

 ""...and I get it, I've worked retail before, but I think that it's incredibly rude that you would refuse to let customers in...""

sulkypotato,122,,223,1oyogs,,877,"It should really be /r/talesfromhospitality, but I thought I'd share anyways. :)

**Background:** About 4 years ago, I was working in a restaurant in a large mall. I had several duties (Hostess, waitress, clearing tables, bartender) for 13 hours a day, every day. Just finished high-school, and decided to spend some time before uni to get some extra cash. 

**What happened:** I've been on shift for about 9 hours and the dinner rush was just starting, with all my combined duties, I was exhausted and customers were being..customers. (Snapping their fingers at me to call me over, changing orders last minute, not giving me two shits, letting their kids run around like the tiny fucktrophies they are etc.) Whatever, perks of the job. 

In comes in a middle-aged caucasian man who seemed quiet and pleasant enough. I sit him down, and he's never been in our restaurant before, so I recommend dishes, take his order and make small talk. Throughout his entire dinner, he gave me absolutely no trouble and every time I had a moment to spare, I made sure that he had everything he needed, and we actually started talking about his work, why he was in Malaysia, turns out he was from France. So we practiced our french together, and we both had a grand ole time. 

The bill came, and unfortunately, I was busy with another table so I couldn't say goodbye to him personally, but I did give him a wave and a smile as he went out. He left a $5 tip on his $40ish meal. This is extremely rare as they don't practice tipping here, and it'll mostly be loose change. Heck, we'd be lucky to even get a dollar on a good day. 

Needless to say, I hoped he would come back again one day. And he did. An hour later. I was hostessing at that point and he came up to the little podium (the one with the menus &amp; reservation book) with a bag in hand. It was from Godiva: uber fancy chocolates, and I joked that whoever got that was a super lucky lady. 
No joke, he gave me the bag. He just handed it to me and said ""This is for you, it's for the amazing service that you gave me and for the nice chats that we had over dinner. It was the most pleasant dinner experience I've had since coming to this country."" 

It was like someone had pantsed me. My mouth fell open and I turned redder than a ginger in summer. I could barely stammer out a ""thank you"", but he understood and went on his merry way. 
Now, by this point, everyone (my ""colleagues"" and some diners) was staring at what just happened, and demanded what happened. I ""spark-noted"" the whole story and just..couldn't stop grinning. 

My entire day was made. And the chocolates were DELICIOUS.

DeaditeQueen,63,,205,1ma3ny,,883,"Most of my clinic posts have had to do with ignorant, nasty or just plain stupid clients. I wanted to share this short one because it was one of the most selfless moments of true love that I had the pleasure to be part of.

There was a long time client and her Boxer mix, Cinder. Cinder had been recently diagnosed with a seizure disorder, and just like with people it can take some time to find the right meds and dosages to keep the seizures under control.

Cinders owner was an upper middle class retiree. She was polite, friendly and had a natural charm, just like her baby Cinder. She was always well dressed and kept her hair and make-up age appropriate yet still very fashionable. She was a staff fav.

I grabbed the phone one late afternoon and it was Cinders owner all in a fluster. She was on her way because Cinder was experiencing the worst seizure she had ever seen her have. Again, just like with people extended seizures can lean to a myriad of neurological issues. She had administered Phenobarbitol but it had done nothing and she was in dire fear for Cinders life.

I alerted the staff that we had an emergency coming in, grabbed Cinders chart and before we could grab a litter to bring Cinder in with she came flying into the parking lot. Now she was a heavy set, and short woman. Cinder was a fairly large Boxer mix. Before I had a chance to hit the door she was wobbling across the lot with Cinder, still seizing furiously in her arms. I raced out to take the dog from her, but before I could reach her she fell and the cracking noise that followed wrenched my gut. She had not only broken her ankle in the fall, but the bone was exposed!

I screamed for my co-workers to call an ambulance and Cinders mom looked up to me a shouted ""Don't worry about me! Cinder! Help Cinder!""

I scooped the dog up and hustled her to the awaiting vets who immediately began treatment. I raced back out with another staffer to do what we could to make Cinders owner comfortable as she laid in boiling hot cement with an exposed ankle bone. She only wanted to know about Cinder. Would she be ok? Had we gotten the seizing to stop? It had only been several minutes so I couldn't answer her questions as much as I wished I could.

The ambulance arrived and whisked her off to the hospital. She even used her cell to call from the ambulance. She knew time was of the essence with the seizing and at that point we had stopped it, but weren't able to give her a prognosis yet.

She had to have surgery on her ankle that kept her in the hospital for almost 2 weeks. We kennels Cinder for her free of charge during this time. By some miracle, the effects of the prolonged seizure were minimal and the news elated her and drove  her hard to get thru physical therapy and heal up.

In the midst of what must have been horrific physical pain she cared only for the well being of her beloved baby. Her own health came second to the dog who loved her with everything she had. It was such a selfless and pure act of love that I felt like I should share. 

Cinder's condition got under control so well that only a visit every few months was necessary and since her owner had to use a cane most of the time at that point Cinder showed amazing patience by keeping her own pace slow and relaxed. She had once bounded and frolicked on her lead, but it was as if she understood what happened that day and was paying her owner back with love and patience.

FredFltStn,120,,419,1on9o2,,874,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  This is one of my dad's favorite stories. If you ever come to hang out and BS with us at the tent, he's probably going to tell it to you. When that happens, please pretend that you've never heard it before. I don't want to steal his glory.

In my experience, firework tents don't always have the best reputation, and are sometimes staffed by people who are...""special"". Let's just say they wouldn't look out of place in a movie about people wielding chainsaws or smoking meth, or possibly wielding chainsaws while smoking meth.

I spent more than a year doing research before I opened my location, and I visited dozens of tents throughout the Southeast US. Although I met some fantastic and friendly people in my travels, I also met plenty of people who may or may not have a dungeon in their basement.

To be fair, it’s hard to find highly skilled workers who are willing to live in a tent for three weeks while basically making minimum wage.

At my store, customer service and product knowledge are top priorities. I make sure that we go above and beyond to help our customers, and that we help you to find just what you’re looking for, even if you don’t know what that is when you first walk through the door.

A few years ago, one of our customers finished up at the register, grabbed his bags, and stopped to talk to my dad on his way out. The conversation went something like this,

**CUST:**  Are you the owner?

**DAD:**  Actually, my son owns the business, I just help him out. Can I help you with anything?

**CUST:**  I just wanted to let you know this was the best experience I’ve ever had buying fireworks. That young man with the curly hair (my nephew) was very helpful. This definitely wasn’t what I was expecting when I saw the tent setup here. You have a lot of stuff to pick from, your staff was friendly and helpful, and you people have all of your teeth.

And with that compliment, the gentleman turned and left.

[deleted],106,,239,1nrwme,,877,"I work in a women's retail store, and we are supposed to wear what we sell. So enter this man and his wife, and I just go through the routine of greeting them and trying to make a sale.

The wife is looking around and the husband comes up to me, and says, ""you look *really good* in that outfit, can you get that for my wife?"" He is just a little creepy, but I get this a lot from customers (usually women). So I told them to sit tight and I'd run around and grab the outfit, which we still had mostly in stock.

The wife is super quiet and nice, and I take them back to the dressing room and let her try it on. Now this lady is not huge, but she's about 45 and obviously has raised a family. Not that I'm judging, she was very pretty, but the shirt fit her 45 yr old child-bearing body way differently than my 22 yr old body. The shirt still looks nice on her, so I tell her. But the husband wasn't hearing none of that. He ran his hands down sides where my curves are, not touching me but close enough and asked, ""So how do I make this shirt look like this on *her*?""

Omg... I was mortified but I felt even worse looking at her, as her face dropped in disappointment. As he didn't seem hesitant at all in his behavior, I figured this was how he usually acted and his wife looked defeated in trying to look good for him.

She bought the outfit and they left. Actually, he came up and paid for it while *she* left. He proceeded to flirt with me and try to find out my work schedule.

Fuck husbands like this. If you can't treat your wife right, than do her a favor and leave. She deserves better.

EDIT: I just wanted to point out that when I said she wasn't huge, I mean she was very average. Not big at all. She just had a tummy, really no big deal at all. Just thought I'd point that out since some people seem to think that how it fit her justifies how the dude acted.

Danabler42,88,,189,1b9bj0,,872,"As I've said...numerous times, and get the feeling I should stop mentioning, I work aerospace, not retail. But this is a story from a friend of mine. 

As a little bit of background: this guy is an older Greek guy who owns a small but very popular local pizza/greek food/whatever you order restaurant. He's been running this place since before I existed, and does his best to make his customers happy. That being said, he will do a lot to make accomplish this. Anything from charging less than he should occasionally, giving free sodas, hell, he's even got a deal set up with the town to feed the plow truck drivers in the winter (we're in New England). However, he does this within reason. If the kitchen messes up your food, he will have it remade. He will not comp you the entire meal for free unless there was an actual problem with the food (which has happened once in a blue moon). And he will not bend over backwards to satisfy a difficult customer. They usually get tossed out. All in all, you would think it's a great place to work, yeah? Servers don't put up with BS from customers, everyone tips, so on. Not really. The owner and his co-owner brother run a tight ship. So what servers do survive the initial training are GOOD. Okay, background over. 

This was during a freak snowstorm one October that had knocked out power to the entire town and half the state. The owner of said restaurant and his brother had been smart and rented (they've since bought one for permanent use) an 80 kW diesel generator that could run the entire restaurant and then some about a couple days before. This accomplished two things. One, they didn't have to make an insurance claim for lost food, two, being the only place in half the state that has power, heat, and hot food has its monetary benefits. 

Anyway, this guy and about 3 of his cronies come in and request a table (place was packed, requesting a table was the only way to get one). They look about college age, and don't seem the troublemaker type. The other 3 order pizza, sandwiches, all kinds of things. The leader orders a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and other things. Kind of a strange order, but they make it without blinking an eye. All in all, their order ended up totaling about a hundred bucks. And since this place isn't that expensive, that's an achievement. The leader ends up complaining his sandwich doesn't taste right. No problem, the owner has the kitchen remake it. After they finish their meal, the 4 take advantage of the crowd of people coming in the door and disappear. However, the server who cleaned their table noticed that the leader one had left his cell phone. She brings it back to the now pissed owner, who immediately thanks her and disappears into the ""command center"" (office). 

He goes into the contacts of the phone, and finds a ""home"" entry. Hits call, and a woman picks up on the third ring. She at first expects her son to be on the other end. Nope. ""Hi, this is John from Village Pizza, and I'm calling to let you know that your son and his friends ordered a large amount of food at my restaurant, ate it and then decided to leave without paying. However, it seems he has left his phone here. So, here's the deal. If he comes back by tomorrow, and pays off the tab, he will receive his phone back and simply be banned from my restaurant. If not, I will involve the police"". 

She is shocked, and manages to stammer out that she will send him right over, and that she's surprised he would ever try something like this. 

Sure enough, leader is back within a couple hours, apologizing up a storm. He pays the tab without argument, and receives his phone back. His parting words to the owner are another apology, in which he ""feels like an asshole"". The owner's response was a good one. ""No, see, you don't FEEL like an asshole, you ARE an asshole. Now get out of my restaurant.""

spedmonkey,159,,186,1hubho,,878,"This afternoon was a relatively slow one. I was covering a break on front register, a few customers were lazily shopping around, and all was as right with the world as it gets in retail. An older middle-aged lady walked up with a few sundries, and made pleasant conversation as I rang up her stuff and bagged it.

Then the co-worker I was covering walked in the front door. I say hello and ask how her break went, she jokes about it, and continues on her way toward the break room to punch back in.

""She's an employee here?"" asks the customer.

""Yep, she's been here longer than I have.""

""Oh. Can I please speak to your manager?""

Wat. ""I'm sorry, is something wrong?""

""You can't do anything about it. Call him please. Now.""

Trying to keep all the what-the-fucks running through my head from spilling across my face, I page my manager, who comes quickly. ""Hi, ma'am, how can I help you today?"" he asks.

The lady turns and points toward the back, where my co-worker has since disappeared. ""I saw that lady last weekend downtown while I was leaving a restaurant. She was loud and obnoxious, and more importantly, *she was NECKING with another girl*!""

And with that, my poker face fell away as I tried to catch up. I didn't doubt the story; my coworker is distinctive, as she has a shock of multi-colored hair that's hard to miss, and she also has a tendency to go out and drink heavily. And she's an open, unrepentant lesbian, with a very nice girlfriend who comes in fairly often.

""Uhhhhhh..."" My manager too was at a loss for words.

""Well, aren't you going to do something about her... her behavior?""

""Ma'am, we can't discipline our employees for how they act when they aren't here at work, as long as they aren't doing anything illegal.""

""But she was being obscene, and both my friends and I were seriously offended! You shouldn't let people like that work here!""

""Once again, was she doing anything illegal?""

""Well, it was certainly immoral! And disgusting!""

""I don't know what to tell you, ma'am. I can't and wouldn't fire someone for being a lesbian. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

""You people are unbelievable! I'm going to call your CEO right now and tell him exactly what kind of people he has working for him!"" She left her would-be purchases in her bag and stormed out.

My co-worker walked up to resume her shift. ""What was that all about?"" she asked, bewildered.

I shrugged. ""We have no freakin' idea,"" said my manager, as we both walked off, shaking our heads.","Sorry, we're not going to discipline someone for being a lesbian off the clock",1064,talesFromRetail
everything3vil,161,,186,1ajlxe,,879,"I work in a store that sells music/movies/pop culture type stuff. There are tons of regulars, but I always hate when this one guy, ""Randall,"" comes in. 

He follows the sales associates around asking if we can give him discounts on the wrestling DVDs that he's addicted to. No. He completely destroys our wrestling DVD section every time he looks through it, and we always have to re-sort and alphabetize it when he leaves. Stop that. He always pays with crumpled up ones and change. Really? When he's not in the store, he calls to ask if we have certain DVDs, and ties up the phone having us read him the description on the back of the case, even though we've read him the same thing 100 times already.

So, this guy is pretty annoying, but he's not straight up terrible. Just maybe a little lonely, right? No. 

Turns out he's married with kids, and he brought his wife and 6-7 year old daughter in with him one day. They're minding their own business, looking around at the Disney section while Randall is of course tearing apart the wrestling section. I'm irritated, but there's really nothing I can do. Randall comes up to the counter with a giant stack of wrasslin' DVDs and pays. His total was something like $200. Crazy. 

He carries his bag back to the kids section where his wife and daughter are, and I hear the lady start SCREAMING. From what I could gather, this lady saved up money for weeks so she could get glasses for their little girl... And he'd just spent that money on wrasslin'. 

I would have been happy to give him a refund, but he just stormed out of the store like a butthurt kid, huffing and puffing about it not being fair.

An older woman, in her late 40s or maybe early 50s, walked in one day and I greeted her automatically, being as cheerful and polite as I can be. She glared at me as though I insulted her by opening my mouth, then stomped up to the counter and slammed a certain M-rated game that involves the theft of cars. I blinked at her and waited patiently, knowing that if I said anything she'd find a way to snap at me about something. The woman, who I'll call PM for Protective Mother, slammed the game onto the counter again and gave me another dirty look, which I replied to with a bright smile. (Kindness pisses crazy people off more, I've learned.)  
PM: Did you sell this fucking game to my son?  
Me: I'm not sure. Do you have a receipt?  
(Our receipts say which associate sold the items.)  
PM: No, I don't have a fucking receipt. Did you sell the fucking game to him or not?  
Me: What does your son look like? Maybe I'll remember him.  
PM: That doesn't fucking matter. Did you know this game is M-rated?  
Me: Yes, ma'am, I'm aware. I believe it's M-rated for violence, drug use, sexual themes, that sort of thing. Is something wrong?  
PM: You should this fucking game to my fucking son! You can't do that!  
Me: I'm sorry to hear that, is he grounded or something?  
At this point, I'm eyeing the backroom and trying to decide whether she'd attack me if I fled. I'm used to crazy people and fairly decent at holding my ground, but she had the crazy eyes that usually led to throwing things.  
PM: No, he's not fucking grounded, he's too old for that!  
Me: ....Ma'am, how old is your son?  
PM: He's twenty-one.  
In case you've never gone to an R-rated movie or bought an M-rated game, the legal age to buy them is 17 or 18, depending on where you live.  
Me: I'm sorry, but he's old enough to buy an M-rated game, so I didn't see a problem.  
PM: Are you fucking insane? You need Jesus, you crazy bitch. This is the work of the devil!  
Me: What can I say, the devil makes good games.  
At that, I promptly turned away and went back to my job, leaving her to glare at my back and huff angrily.  
PM: I'm still fucking talking to you!  
Me: I'm sorry, but I can't actually help you. If you want to do a return, I need your receipt.  
PM: This is why women shouldn't work, they're fucking useless.  
Me: You do realize you're a woman, don't you?  
This pissed her off and finally made her leave, hollering about Jesus and women workers. At this point, of course, my manager walks out from the back room where she was doing paperwork and gives me a funny look. I just shrugged and went back to what I was doing, because I honestly didn't get paid enough to give a damn that she was a crazy woman who thought I was Satan's bride.

I work at a store that sells a small amount of work shoes. Mainly scrubs and hospitality but some shoes. I usually work in the back office but sometimes my coworkers ask me to assist with belligerent customers as I'm better at dealing with them than the other girls. 



I am working in the back when the 17 year old, part time girl comes in with a horrified look on her face and tells me there is a guy who wants to buy shoes but can't touch his feet.



I'm confused but come to help as the Full Time Manager has gone to take another one of her 45 minute rest room breaks leaving the poor part timer alone.



I see the problem instantly.



The Gentleman sitting in our shoe section was so large that the arm rests on the 2 person bench were digging into his sides. If anyone is a fan of Gabriel Iglasias this guy was 100% an ""Oh Hell NO"" on the fluffy scale. He may have been wider than he was tall. 5'4, at least 400 pounds and sweating profusely from the, at most, 20 foot walk from the parking lot into our store.



He also stinks. B.O and stale pizza and garlic and something I can only describe as ""funk"".



I make sure to breathe through my mouth, put on my retail smile and approach the large gentleman.



Me: Can I help you?



Oh Hell No: I want to try on those *points in the general vicinity of some shoes*



Me: Ok. They are considered women's though, so we might not carry your foot size.



Note: The shoes are technically womens but aren't overly feminine looking. They are basic black clogs and it isn't unusual for men to ask to try them on although it is rare for us to have a pair that will actually fit them.



Oh Hell No: I know but I am only an 8 in Mens so I was hoping a 10 would fit.



Me: Ok, I'll be right back with those.



I fetch the shoes. I grab a pair of 10.5's as well, just to be a good little retail worker. I'm thinking everything is going okay. Yes, the guy stinks but at least he isn't rude.



I hand the shoes to the very large Gentleman, who instantly hands them back.



Me: Oh! I am sorry, did I bring you the wrong thing?



Oh Hell No: You need to put them on my feet.



My face went from retail smile to cranky bitch don't get paid enough for this shit in about 2 milliseconds, I'm sure.



Me: Sir, I am not touching your feet.



Oh Hell No: What?! Why not!!



He's cranky now and the fat on his body has started to ripple and he vibrates with anger.



Me: Because I am not your caretaker, or your personal shopper and it is not my job to dress or undress any part of your person.



Oh Hell No: THAT'S DISCRIMINATION!!!!



Me: You clearly have no idea what that word means nor will bellowing it induce me, or anyone working in the store to touch you. It is against our store policy. If you have an issue with it, you may speak to the owner, she will be in Monday after 10.



Fun fact: The store policy line isn't a lie. A former co-worker had gotten the store in trouble for, poorly, attempting to help a paralyzed woman. I didn't want to touch the exceedingly large Gentleman because he was gross as hell but I, thankfully, had policy to back me up.



Guy is seething with rage now, everyone in the store is looking at him and back to me when a 2nd, large Gentleman walks into the store.



This guy only hits a ""Fluffy"" on the fluffy scale and is the epitome of the jolly fat guy stereotype. Well groomed beard, glasses, big old smile on his face.



Fluffy guy approaches Oh Hell No and, in a friendly, albeit loud, voice asks if Oh Hell NO has been trying on shoes.



Oh Hell No: I can't. She won't put them on for me. (sneered at me)



Fluffy: Why would she? It's not her job and I told you I'd help you as soon as I got back from the boys room, you impatient fuck. (still said in that jovial, up beat tone of voice.



Oh Hell No: *mutters something I don't catch all of but I hear the word Disabled*



Fluffy: You're not disabled! You're FAT!



Oh Hell NO seethes to himself whilst Fluffy looks over at me with that big old grin.



Fluffy: I can say that too him cos I'm his brother. Don't you worry about him, luv. He's just cranky cos he hasn't seen his cock in 17 years.



I had to walk away because I was dying with laughter. I walked into the back, put my face into my sweater and laughed for a solid 2 minutes.

boredinwisc,121,,212,1i0pq1,,848,"(Sorry, this one got long again)

Gather 'round children and hear a tale.  A tale from a long, long time ago. Back when the Earth was cool(er), no Hybrids roamed the land and smoking inside was still (mostly) acceptable.

So my last story was well received so I thought I would throw another one out there for you guy and gals.  

Backstory: I was working as a waiter in a pretty typical restaurant.  We had our entryway in the middle and the north side of the restaurant was smoking and the south side non-smoking.  On this particular day though, I had been asked to cover the host table.

We were pretty busy, I think it must have been a weekend or Friday evening and (as it usually went) the non-smoking section had a bit of a wait, while the smoking section had immediate seating.  I had a younger couple (maybe mid-twenties) come up and the following is a dramatic retelling (cut me a break, it was awhile ago, but I'll do my best to stay accurate) of the following 3 encounters with these people (Man = Chris and Woman = Jennie):

**First Encounter**

Me: Hi, welcome to [Redacted], table for two?

Chris: Yup.

Me: Perfect, do you have a preference for smoking or non-smoking?

Jennie: Non-smoking.

Me: Sure, no problem, it will be about a 5-10 minute wait though, but I can put your name on our list.

Jennie: [Starting to come across a bit bitchy] Are you kidding? Is there any way we can be seated now?

Me: Sure, but the only tables I have open right now are in the smoking area.  If that's okay I can get you seated right away.

(They discuss this for a moment before): Chris: Yeah, that's fine, thanks.

Me: No worries, let me show you to your table.

I proceed to go through the normal spiel and return to my counter. 

**Second encounter**

Jennie: Excuse me, sir?

Me: [Excusing myself from the conversation I was having with a regular] Yes ma'am, what can I help you with?

Jennie: It reeks by our table.

Me [Genuinely concerned] I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to come check on what it might be?

Jennie: [Huffy, hand on left hip, right hip stuck out, gesticulating with right hand] I know what it is. It reeks of cigarettes.

Me: [Holding back bewildered amusement] Well, ma'am, it *is* the smoking section.

Jennie: But it smells really strongly of cigarettes!

Me: Ma'am, I apologize again, but I'm confused; what do you want me to do?

Jennie: It reeks and there is smoke everywhere.

It's at this point that I look over to check the area and make sure there's not a fire or something.  There was one person smoking.  In the smoking section. ONE.  I get if you are aggravated by smoke it being a problem, but you **CHOSE** to sit there.

Me: I'll tell you what, if you would like I can put you on the list for a table and we will move you when there is an opening. Is that okay?

I usually wouldn't have offered this with a pretty full house as they were already taking up a table.  Typically I would have told them they would have to come back up front and wait then, but I didn't want to jeopardize their waiters tips.

Jennie: Ugh, fine.

After about 10 minutes we get them over to a non-smoking table and we all move on with our days, right?

**Third Interaction**

Chris: Excuse me?

I had no one up front at this point and turn my attention to him.

Me: Yes sir, how may I help you?

Chris: [Gesturing toward his table] Yeah, my girlfriend said her food smells funny.

Me: [After looking where he pointed and understanding the situation more fully] Is there something that I can do? Would you like me to have it re-made? Have you spoken to your waiter? (I was really confused as to why they were coming to me with a food related issue.

Chris: I don't know where he is.  She says it smells like smoke.

Me: Is it possible that they smell is still lingering in her nose after being in the smoking section?

Chris: [Looking downtrodden] ...yeah.

Me: Okay... um...

Chris: Look, I'm going to level with you. She's being kind of a bitch tonight.  Can I just pay you now and then get boxes?

I am left at this point to assume he wanted her to think he got it for free and just avoid the fight.

Me: Um... sure... 

I called over his waiter, got the check from him and rang through his card.  He actually left his server a pretty sizeable tip and apologized again.  But as he is signing his slip, up comes - 

Jennie: What are you doing?

Chris: I'm paying so we can leave.

Jennie: Are you fucking kidding?!

That actually caught me off-guard as even though she had been a horrible patron she didn't look like the ""swearing in public"" type.

Chris: Calm down, we're leaving.

Jennie: No! You shouldn't pay for this fucking shit! (Quite the mouth on her in my memory) It smelled and tasted like crap!

I was getting ready to start damage control when - 

Chris: Shut the fuck up! Jesus. Screw this. [To me] Have a good day man. Sorry about her.

He then took her by the arm and walked out.

I'm quite a stickler for this rule, as I know the consequences for the store if we're caught breaking it. And seeing as the local police regularly wander around, it's not worth taking that risk. The problem with this is checking ID is often a pain when the store is busy, mainly because I'm terrible at math and need to count the age of the customer out in my head.

In order to get around this, I don't offer samples to anyone who looks like they could be underage or around our legal age (18). But if someone comes up and asks for a sample, that's fine, I check ID. Not a problem. Most of the time I will only ask for ID if I'm pretty sure they're underage or they're being a douchebag. Either or. But anyway, I digress.

I'd been standing on the lease line (the front of the store, right where people walk past or into the shop) serving a few customers when a group of basketball singlet, baggy pants clad guys came past and started wolf whistling, then walked off. Not too long after one of the group returned - from here on I'll address him as Not-So-Bright, or NSB for short.

NSB nonchalantly walks past the shop a couple of meters away, looking around. I offer samples to a couple who have just walked in, they politely decline. NSB by now has reached the security point, turns around and walks back - a little closer this time but still looking around, looking nonchalant. 

He continues walking past, getting closer and closer each time, but still looking around as if he's just going for a casual stroll before his flight. I recognised the kid as one of the wolf-whistlers from before so ignored him, offering samples to the other passengers walking by. NSB keeps up his casual strolling, getting closer and closer and eventually just staring at me, trying to catch my eye in the hope that I'll offer him a drink.

Eventually NSB gives up trying to catch my attention and walks straight up to the promo bar.

**NSB:** Hey, what have you got there?

**Me:** Hi there! Today we're sampling the different flavours of *[insert alcohol brand here]* 

**NSB:** Oh hell yeah! Free shots? I want one!

**Me:** Awesome! I just need to see your ID first, if that's OK?

NSB doesn't answer, just gives me a blank stare. I figure he may not get it, so I try to reiterate.

**Me:** ...I'm uh, not allowed to give samples to anyone under the age of 18, so I'll have to check your ID. 

**NSB:** *[still with blank look]* Yeah, I'm over 18. So can I have one?

**Me:** I need to see your ID first, I know it seems silly but  we have to make sure we aren't giving alcohol to minors.

**NSB:** Nah, it's cool. I'm over 18. I'm 19.

**Me:** I still need to see ID sorry, or I can't give you a sample. 

The kid is still staring blankly at me - you can practically see the gears ticking over in his head trying to decide what to do next.

**NSB:** Ah, yeah... I forgot my ID, sorry. *[laughs]* I do this every damn time. But it's cool, I'm 19 - I'm not underage.

**Me:** You forgot your ID?

**NSB:** *[shrugs]* Yeah, I must've left it at home.

It's now my turn to stare blankly at NSB. At this point I will remind everyone that we are in Duty Free. Duty Free in an Airport. Airside Duty Free in an Airport... The customs and security checkpoint is literally less an 100m to our left. I'm struggling to comprehend all the stupid that's going on right now.

**Me:** You... don't have your ID.

**NSB:** Yeah.. I just said.. I left it at home. 

**Me:** Your passport is fine...

**NSB:** *[starting to get a bit irritated]* I just told you, I left it at home! Just give me the damn shot already.

**Me:** You don't have your passport on you.

**NSB:** NO.

I really have no idea what to do. One half of me is shocked at the sheer stupidity of this moron, the other half is desperately trying not to laugh. 

**Me:** Then how, may I ask, did you manage to get through customs without a passport?! 

NSB loses all emotion on his face. I'm struggling to maintain my composure and not burst out laughing. He literally just stands there, silent, for about 30 seconds. Then turns and just walks away. As soon as he turned I burst into fits of laughter.

I'd really love to know what was going through his head through that whole exchange.

**TL;DR** If you're going to try and pull the ""forgot my ID"" card when trying to get alcohol samples from promo staff, make sure you're doing it in a place which doesn't require you to have your passport.","Conveniently ""forgetting"" your ID may work on your local bottle store, Sir, but it's a bit harder to pull off when you've just gone through customs at an airport - Tales from Duty Free",1075,talesFromRetail
NejKidd,104,,190,1ouume,,841,"Just saw a story that reminded me of this. I work in a normal supermarket in the UK as a CSA. I work in every department but I'm usually put on checkouts as I'm quite personable. Our uniforms are very dark blue with lime piping so it's not exactly common, but occasionally our staff wear mint green shirts, usually when they're managers. This becomes important later. 

I was on the checkout serving, when an elderly woman came to my till looking quite flustered. I'll call her Flustered Biddy (FB). I quickly asked her if she had found everything today, trying to gauge why she was upset.

&gt; FB: well, I would have if any of your staff knew where things were! *she slams her purse down on the till*

&gt; Me: oh dear! What was it you were looking for?

&gt;FB: just some condensed milk! But I tried asking a manager where it was and he had no clue. He wouldn't even go find out! He was so rude and lazy. He needs more training!

&gt; Me: I can't think who you could be talking about. All of our staff are usually accomodating. I'm sorry for your experience, I'll run and get your milk now.

I left the till for a moment and came back with the milk, sold it to her and as I'm finishing up the transaction she got a bit overexcited as she pointed over my shoulder, practically shouting across the store.

&gt; FB: that's him! That's the man who didn't know where the milk was and was very rude about it!

&gt; Me: *I turn to see a man in a mint green shirt looking my way sheepishly. I've never seen him before in my life. I turn back to FB* I'm really sorry, madam, but that man doesn't work here.

&gt; FB: of course he does! He's wearing your uniform!

&gt; Me: actually he's wearing the shirt of [local bank that's across the road]. You can see his name badge says that, not [supermarket].

&gt; FB: well he shouldn't do his shopping dressed in his uniform! It's very confusing! I should report him to his manager.

She bustled away angrily while I looked on, perplexed. I didn't see whether she went into the bank to complain about the man to the proper authorities. Though I'm curious what would be on his write-up: ""reprimanded for not knowing where the milk was in the local supermarket""?

BenSisko,208,,234,1p9wov,,837,"Hello TFR! I, like many others, am a long time lurker, and this is my first post. Apologies for the wall of text to follow! 

I work at for a large coffee chain in the UK. I've been at my store for a few years now, and have many tales to tell. This story focusses on one of the worst co-workers I have ever had the displeasure of working with.

My co-worker (who I'll refer to as Tony) is a nightmare. Short-tempered, agressive and generally awful. He's rude to customers and co-workers alike. We've had a LOT of complaints about his behaviour, but one incident really stood out.

It was a really relaxed day- not many customers, and a good group working, with the exception of Tony. A lovely woman came up to the counter with her little girl (we'll call her LW) and ordered a coffee for her and a childrens hot chocolate for her daughter.

At our coffee shop, our kids hot chocolates are cooler drinks served in double espresso cup. 

So, Tony makes LW's drinks (not to a particularly high standard), not making conversation with her or making eye contact and, well, just being generally rude. LW thanks us, takes her drinks, and sits down. 

A few minutes later, she comes back up to the counter. LW's really apologetic, and says that her daughters hot choc is a little too cold. Fair enough, it happens. Better too cold than too hot for a little kid. Unfortunately, the person she goes to to sort it out is Tony.

Tony snatches the drink and spins round to the coffee machine without a word. I apologise to LW for the cold drink and tell her we'll bring it over to her table when its ready.

Tony took the complaint as a personal insult. He was FUMING. I heard him muttering something as he re-made the drink, but didn't think much of it. He pours the drink, goes over to LW's table and slams it down before storming off.

One of my other co-workers, who we'll call Linda, calls me over to the coffee machine while Tony is stomping around clearing tables, still visibly angry about the 'complaint'.

""Sisko, you better see this,"" Linda said, lifting up the jug we use to heat up the hot chocolate and pointing at the thermometer. There was still hot choc in the jug, and the thermometer was reading at *180 degrees*. To put that in context, a normal adult coffee is heated up to about 140-150, and a childs drink to no more that 100. 

He was so irrationally angry that LW had complained, *he had purposefully overheated the drink to burn the kid.*

Before I had a chance to react, I hear the little girl start to cry. She'd burnt her mouth on the crazy hot drink. 

I ran over and apologised profusely, offering a full refund for their order. LW thanked me, but said it wasn't neccessary. She just wanted to speak to the manager.

I went and grabbed my manager, and LW made a formal complaint. My manager apologised and promised disciplinary steps would be taken, but LW said she would not be coming in again while Tony was still employed.

It was clearly intentional. Tony even admitted to it to some degree when he was confronted (""Well, she complained it was cold. She wanted it hotter, I made it hotter. What more did she want?"")

This happened over a year ago. The worst thing about this story? He's still working there now.

Oakwater,196,,212,1jqhxb,,838,"Hello all, 

I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our company.

Many moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain. Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day. 

This sunday was no different, in the store was myself, the assistant manager and lets call her ""Kay"". Kay was an extremely large girl in her late teens, she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single sense.

The day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the 10 - 4 shift. Kay had gone for her break at 12 because she couldn't ""last another minute without some food to keep her going"". This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at 1.

Anyway, she rolled back to the shop floor 15 minutes too long from her break and I went for my lunch at 1 o'clock. As per my usual routine I went to the local supermarket to grab a sandwich and the manager had gone out back to do some paper work. This left Kay to man the shop for the 30 minutes I would be gone.

After devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop. 

I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker. But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be. 

Oh.. well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or something?

I walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for me.

The displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barren.

Strewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown it's contents across the aisle.

Shit.

I panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened. I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunch.

Kay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work. 

Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock loss.

Amazingly.

Just purely amazingly, she wasn't immediately fired.

TL;DR Lazy coworker desire to stuff face means she leaves the entire shop unmanned for nearly 30 minutes. Thieves have a field day.

EDIT: For those asking on a follow up or more stories, honestly I'm sorry to say that the repercussions were not all that severe. She managed to blag her way out of it somehow with a written warning.

However for some closure, she was fired about a month later when our store manager caught her eating stolen crisps in the bathroom. I'm sorry for the dissapoint.",A loss of £1000's of pounds of stock because a staff member hadn't eaten in a few minutes.,1050,talesFromRetail

This store, a small, independent video game store, had a framed poster about 16"" x 20"", with a picture of ""the back."" The room was perhaps 8' x 10' with a little table, a couple chairs, and an electric kettle. Underneath, it said:

Point 1) This is the back. Notice that there are no shelves. If we say it's not in the store, we are not hiding it in here.

Point 2) If there IS anything being stored in the back, we can't give it to you anyway because we would be breaking the street date for the product. Side note: No, we will not break a street date for you.

Point 3) If there is anything we don't have which you want, we would be happy to order it for you immediately to get it for you as quickly as possible!

Point 4) Pursuant to Point 3, if ordering within days of the following, we cannot guarantee the order's arrival beforehand: Christmas, New Years, Birthdays, Anniversaries, anything you probably should have taken care of before now.

Reymont,176,,275,162qiz,,826,"Howdy, folks!

In college, I did about four years as a cashier working the nightshift at Safeway.  Thing is, I'm just not a people person - I can't stand them!  So retail wasn't a good fit for me.  I could never believe how rude some people were, and had a lot of fun trying to give as much back to them as possible without getting fired.

I had plenty of chances to try this, but only managed to pull off the whole thing twice in my career.

Seems very weird, but multiple times a night, every night, I'd ring up someone's groceries and tell them the total, something like ""That'll be $82.04, sir!"" only to be presented with $82.00, as if that was close enough.  Do I look like Mr. Safeway himself?  Are we playing Let's Make a Deal?  

So I'd usually respond with ""Uh...it's not 'best offer,' sir.  I do need that four cents.""

Sometimes they'd ask if I could take it out of the little coin jar, which was great because I got to pull holier-than-thou on them:  ""Gasp!  That's for CHARITY!""  as loud as I could.  That always ended it, but it felt like a cheap win.

But the two golden wins that I mentioned?  Those guys huffed and puffed and rolled their eyes and couldn't BELIEVE I was going to waste their very important time insisting on those last four measly cents.  So they both dug into their pockets and took their time and very very slowly counted out four pennies onto the counter like they were doing me a HUGE favor, one - two - three - four, while sneering at me.

Both times, I took those four pennies by sweeping them off the counter into one hand, and intentionally drop a couple onto the floor, while saying ""Thank you!"" and smiling.  Then I'd ring them up and finish the order and give them their receipt, all while acting like I hadn't noticed I'd dropped a couple of their precious pennies.

Now, it's money, and people are conditioned to think it's important.  So they started off sneering like they'd won a big victory with their slow penny count, but then they'd start to shuffle their feet and frown and worry that I hadn't noticed those dropped cents.  Finally, they'd begrudgingly offer ""...uh, you know you dropped a couple.""  

At which point I'd shrug and say ""So what?  It's just a few cents.  NEXT!""

quinyd,117,,247,1h6v0z,,823,"This is a kind of reverse retail. I pay for peoples broken stuff aka i work in insurance as a claim handler. 

*This became way longer than I had expected, but you can learn a trick or two about talking to your insurance company.*

First a little introduction;

This story is from a few years ago when I worked for a big insurance company *somewhere* in Europe, I was 20 at the time. Because the company wanted to have happy customers and quickly expedite claims, I rarely had to ask my supervisor for payment approval, which was nice. If I deemed it fair I could pay ~$3000 without asking my supervisor. If I needed to pay between ~$3000 and ~$15000 I had to mention it to my supervisor and above $15000 I needed approval. This was nice because my employer trusted me and my coworkers with a lot of money and 99% of the time they would support our decision. It was overall an awesome place to work!

One thing I learned pretty quickly was that people tend to overstate things worth and tried to get more money from me because they think I don't know what things are worth. Sometimes people got angry because *I’m too young to know how valuable their stuff is*...

*Now to the story;*

In this case a customer calls and tell me his Mac is broken. 
I'm immediately alert because; 

- 1. I know my Mac's; both older and newer and know what they are worth.
- 2. People ALWAYS assume their Mac is at least worth twice as much as it is. 

I start out by smalltalking with the guy. I'm always starting out with this, since I want to get information about the computer without directly asking. People tend to understate age and use or wear and overstate price, when asking directly. To avoid this I’m trying to be friendly and make him tell me the details without asking. This might seem cruel, but I have to get him to tell me the truth.

So his Mac has water damage, this is understandable since there was a big flood the week before and I accept the damage claim. The computer is about 4 years old so I [look it up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_by_case_type) while continuing to talk to him. Since it is a desktop I assume this is an Aluminum iMac Core 2. 

I ask him what model it is and he says it is a G4. Here I stop him and ask how he can have a 4 year old [G4 Power Mac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4). 

He confesses that he bought 4 years ago, which I tell him makes it at least 7 years old, possible 13 years old. 

At this time I'm already thinking that he won’t get much for his computer. 

He tells me it is worth $2000 and that he would like the money ASAP. 
When people tell me they want money ASAP, alarm bells goes off and, I slow down a bit. His G4 is definitely not worth $2000 and I offer him a replacement G4, which I can get for him on *craigslist-like-site*. This is normal practice; I can try and replace the broken object or give him cash. 

Most people chose cash (understandable). 

I also explain that if he wants cash I can only give him $100. This, I explain, is based on the age of the computer (which I set at 9 years) and the original price. With an estimated original price of $2500 I can subtract 90% because it is electronic and over 9 years old, meaning I can give him $225. But he also have a *self-risk* of $125, that he has to pay every time he has a damage claim. 

He is, of course, not happy. 

If you lost your fine working computer and was offered $100 you wouldn't be happy too. But you have to understand that I can only give compensation for actual hardware, not sentimental value. 

I try and explain that I can't do anything else for him and that I suggest he take the offer of a replacement computer, which I will arrange to have shipped directly to his door. 

He then goes on and explain to me that he need it right now and that he would like to go buy one ASAP, because he can't work without it. 
I become alert by this statement because, if it is a work PC then I can't give him anything at all, since it is a personal insurance and not company insurance.

I directly ask him, even though I could already now reject the claim (on the basis that it is a work computer), if he uses it for work and what kind of work he does. He denies it is for his job and says personal work in general, I accept this because I’m a nice person :)

He again tries to convince me it is worth a lot more and I tell him the price reduction and that I know my fair share of Mac's, which basically means he won't have any luck with me. He sounds pretty bumped out and most of my coworkers would probably have giving him a bit more, since they aren't familiar with Mac's. 

He is not happy at all and puts his mom on (SURPRISE!). I had to mute the phone and say WTF to my coworker next to me. I can see that he is in his thirties and I cannot understand how he believes that his mother can convince me to pay more.

She starts to complain and tell me that his son can't work without his computer. 
Again I ask what kind of work he does on this computer and I hear the guy in the background tell her that he doesn't use it for work.
I laugh to myself and tell her the same as I told him. 

He comes back on and I tell him he can talk to my supervisor who will offer him the same deal. Since I offer for him to talk to my supervisor I seem like the big guy and he believes me. My supervisor who has no idea about Mac's would trust my judgment and tell him the same.

He reluctantly accepts and I transfer the $100 to his bank account ASAP.

I tell the story to my supervisor, who laughs and say *it is good to have young people who knows about electronics*.

Just another day at the office!

I have a lot more stories from my days in insurance; if this one is well received I will post more!

So I am the department head of the Paperclips Copy and Print center. I'm just having a slow day, which is strange in the middle of tax season, when I get a call. I pick up the phone and give my usual ""Thank you for calling Paperclips copy center, Echo104b speaking, can I help you?""

""I just sent a job into your online submission and I want to make sure it came through."" he says calmly.

""Can I get your name?""

He gives me his info and I log into our order retrieval system. He placed the order less than 2 minutes ago. I download the file he needs printed. While that's happening, I look at the order specs. Cheapest paper, double sided, 3 hole punch. That's a red flag. Those instructions are usually for a textbook of some kind, and unless the customer has a copyright release from the publisher, I'm not allowed to print textbooks.

The file download finishes and I look at it. Yep. Textbooks. And right in the middle of page 2 is an enormous block of text prefaced by ""(C) 20XX publishing company INC.""

About 2 minutes have passed at this point and I pick up the phone once again, and prep to give him the usual copyright denial. This happens about three or four times a day and the customers, while disappointed, are usually understanding. Not this guy.

""Sir? I'm glad you called. I'm not allowed to print the file you uploaded because it has a copyright mark on page two. Do you have a copyright release form that would allow us to print this?""

""I don't need one of those, I get these printed all the time.""

""Well sir, this book is copyright and by printing it and selling you the prints, Paperclips will be profiting from the sale of copywriten material and I can't allow that.""

""So the other copies I've gotten from you are illegal? I should report you guys then.""

I do a customer order history search by his name and the last order he placed with us was two years ago. It was canceled with a reason given of ""problem with uploaded file: copyright""

Bingo. This guy is full of crap and he's mad he didn't get away with it. I call his bluff. We've no record of any prior orders being processed and if he did anything off the books through us, Paperclips has Plausible Deniablilty.

What do I do? 

Call his bluff.

""What was the name of the associate that made the copies for you? If we have an associate breaking copyright, I need to review the copy procedure with him.""

""I don't remember. I'm reporting Paperclips for copyright infringement and calling your corporate office to report you for your terrible service.""

""There's nothing I can do to stop you from doing that. Go ahead. They'll tell you the same thing.""

""This is bullshit!""

This goes back and forth for s few minutes and at this point I'm tired of it. Time to use shock tactics. 

""Name: John Q. Customer. Phone number: 123-456-7890. Last order 10/XX/200X. Canceled due to copyright infringement. Previous order 08/XX/200X canceled due to copyright infringement. Membership number XXXXXXXXXX lifetime spending total $XXX.XX..."" 

I go on for a little bit longer, reading off his entire customer history. A few minutes later, I'm finished and the line is silent.

He quietly speaks up ""I'm sorry, good day"" and meekly hangs up the phone.

TLDR: customer lies. Gets verbal smack down. ",Copyright? That's not my problem!,1015,talesFromRetail
toxlab,137,,208,1h24vl,,827,"Time for another one of my rambling goofy stories. As usual, there will be a TL;DR at the bottom. Strap in!

Right after high school, I took a break from restaurant work to go into the then very new field of video rental. I worked for Blockbuster for a while, helping new stores get set up and staffed. After about a year of this, a local company trying to compete was opening up new stores near existing 'Buster locations. They were cherry picking employees for the management of these new stores. I was offered a ridiculous salary and quite a bit of authority. 

The new company was just a reskinned Blockbuster. same product, same pricing, just different colors. There was one thing a little different, though.

Porn.

This was in Cincinnati, Ohio. A very conservative city. If you've ever seen the film, ""The People VS Larry Flynt"", the man who prosecuted Flynt for obscenity, Simon Leis, was now the sheriff. And he still had a hard on for smut. It was illegal to sell Playboy, no adult films could be had, and his group of obscenity watchdogs patrolled business, looking for filth. 

Blockbuster immediately rolled over and showed their cute, ""family friendly"" bellies. They never carried porn, they refused to stock titles with the new NC 17 rating, and anything that was disliked was pulled off the shelves. They got rid of ""Last Temptation of Christ"" because of the letter writing campaign this group staged. Terroristic threats of arson and vandalism were the norm. 

This new store showed some balls. They carried NC 17, and while they didn't have hardcore porn, they did have a section called, ""Private Screenings"". It was mostly softcore offerings like ""Emmanuel"", and ""Best Chest In The West"". It was all stuff you could find in any R rated movie. But the titles were sometimes a little salacious, and people would see the tapes, shelved spine out instead of flat so no one could see the covers, and wig out. Once or twice a week, someone would come in and blow steam about us being smut peddlers. I would ask for their card, and cut it up, wishing them the best in their future rental endeavors. 

At first, I was amused by the steady stream of customers these tapes brought in. It was squeaky clean smut, something you could get your hands on locally. Customers would be waiting in the lot when I turned up to open. When I would unlock the doors, they'd get their lite porn, cash out, and bolt. As if there were some masturbation emergency going on. One guy would rent three, come back four hours later, and get three more. He did this four days a week for my entire time there. 

Occasionally, people would forget about returning their porn. Nothing was more enjoyable than the daily calls of shame. I would retire to the office with my list, and start dialing. 

Me: Hello. Is Mr X there?

Her: This is Mrs. X.

Me: Hi, this is toxlab from NotBuster Video. I'm calling about an overdue tape on your account.

Her: We haven't been in there in weeks! We don't have any movies!

Me: Well, someone on your account rented ""Prison Island Bitches"" on Friday night.

Her:(in the background, a tiny fire bursts into an inferno) OH. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT RIGHT AWAY!


I'm shelving tapes one day, and notice that we have a copy of ""Caligula"" on the private screenings shelf. If you've never heard of it, it's a film starring Malcom MacDowell and other respected actors. It's about the mad Roman emperor, and his wild orgies and other bizarre behavior. After it was filmed, producer Bob Guccione (of Penthouse fame) decided that what the film needed was more dong. So he shot huge, epic hard core orgy scenes. He essentially inserted well known actors into a porno flick. This did not go over well in hollywood. 

I take it home. As soon as it starts, I realize it's the hardcore cut of the film. Distributing this in our city will get you jail time. When I return it, I leave it in the office. The next day, I start looking for other titles that might not make the cut. I inform my employers. Some movies are easy to rule out, just by the distribution titles. Others, not so easy. We had a copy of ""Party at Kitty and Studs"", the porno movie featuring a young Sylvester Stallone. The movie was softcore, but the trailers before it were hard. There are a few dozen titles that I find doubtful. What should we do?

The district manager doesn't want to shut the section down. Complaints aside, the tiny section brings in a LOT of revenue. And usually, people grab a couple new releases before they say, ""Hey, as long as I'm here, I'll grab ""No Muff Too Tough"". 

How do we solve this problem? The solution is that we must screen EVERY LAST ONE of these tapes. We don't have to take notes as the plot develops, just put it on fast forward and be on the lookout for arcing ropes of jism. 

This duty falls to me. 

The manager above me was a 40 year old virgin. He was scandalized when the DM suggested he do it. He had never seen a dirty movie, and didn't know where the lines were drawn. He was an innocent soul. He also had a shrine to The Little Mermaid in his house, but that's neither here nor there.

Every night, I would fill my book bag with tapes to check. TV on. Sound off. One good pile, one bad pile. Away we go.

Asking an 18 year old to look for porn is a good idea. You have a preternatural sense about boobies. You are always happy to see 'em, and you're always ready for more. On occasion, the fast forwarded drama would prove too intriguing and I had to return to regular speed. ""Wait a minute. First she was in a classroom, blowing a teacher, and now she's in prison, having a lesbian three way? What happened here?"" 

This continued for about a month I believe I found a total of twelve tapes that could get us in trouble. We pitched them and continue on our merry way.

One afternoon, a gentleman came in and discovered our naughty treasure trove. He was affronted.

He: How dare you, corruption of youth, jesus is weeping, etc. etc.

I: I can assure you, sir, that every tape in that section meets community standards. The covers may be a little vulgar, but the contents merit no more than an R rating.

He: HOW DO YOU KNOW? HAVE YOU SEEN EVERY MOVIE IN THE STORE?

I: Yessir, I have. Every one of them.
&lt;I suddenly realize how this sounds and start to blush&gt;
Erm, I had to. For work. I was checking them for work. We had to make sure. 

I am now sweating.

I: I HAD TO DO IT! I DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH THEM ALL! Really...I....

He took his tapes and left. Whenever I saw he or his wife after that, I got the strangest looks...

**TL;DR**18 year old me, in prudest city in the country, paid to watch porn

Well, today, I got my first aggressive response. I knew there would be trouble when I saw him with nothing but a key card in his hand. I ask him for ID before I ring his cigarettes up. 

""What the fuck, why?""

Me: ""It's against the law for me to sell to people who could potentially be under 18.""

""This is fucking bullshit, you're definitely not 18, you shouldn't even be allowed to sell them! I can't believe you're not selling me them when you're younger than me!""

I'm used to being told I look way younger than what I really am. Both coworkers and customers have been floored by how young I apparently look. I try and take it as a compliment, but I look in the mirror and I seriously can't see what makes me look young.

I try and tell him my actual age, but he continued his tirade and threatened to call the police on the store for letting a minor sell cigarettes, whilst pulling out his ID (why chuck a hissy fit if you have it?!).

That's when I got fed up, and slammed my driver's license on the counter. You should have seen his face when he realized that not only was I over 18, but I was actually over two years his senior. 

His silence whilst I rung him up was more than golden. Customers waiting behind him were all smiles when I served them.

jbrake,121,,223,1fii2b,,813,"Hey all, first post in this subreddit. 

I want to give a very short introduction. I was a radio personality, strip club bouncer, and body piercer in South Carolina. I now work as a trivia writer/quizmaster for a pub quiz company and roller derby announcer. My jobs have all been outside the norm and because of it, I have stories that many others find entertaining. 

Here's one from being a body piercer:

I was working in a very small body piercing shop, like pretty much all of them are in South Carolina. Tattooing was still illegal at this time, so it was still taboo to even have surface piercings we find common place (e.g. navel). 

Our shop was in a small strip mall that looked more like an old outdoor motel than a business center. the only other business of note was a hair salon a couple of doors down.

I had a woman call into the shop and ask if the staff had experience with genital piercings. I advised her that all of our staff had performed them as part of our apprenticeship and that I could answer any question she had. She said that she would just come in to talk to me with her husband since it was around the corner.

Cut to 30 minutes later and I get another call while setting up packages for autoclaving. It's the blonde that runs the hair salon next to me.

""Um, do you have a couple coming in to get pierced?"" she said.

""Yeah, how did you know that?""

She stammered, ""Be-because they are having sex in the parking lot.""

As I mentioned, body piercing was still coming along in South Carolina and a lot of the taboo was normal, God fearing people didn't have piercings. As I opened up the blinds to see a Chrysler New Yorker do some rocking no less than 100 ft from my front door, I silently cursed them for giving the girl next door some leverage with the property owner come lease renewal. 

I shut the blinds and go back to business as usual. Last thing I wanted to do was have them walk in with me giving them a knowing stare in case they were in fact that oblivious and not exhibitionists. Once they came into the store, I spoke with the woman while her husband sat on a couch. She was interested in a piercing known as a C-Hood, but was unsure on a vertical or horizontal. I said that firstly depended on her amount of hood. I laid out a seat cover for my piercing chair and had her sit down so I could examine her.

After she spread her legs, she had a little bit of a bush...that currently had small globes of beading semen at the end of various hairs as well as a matted patch. 

""Ma'am, I'm afraid your husband is, still on you. That's a biohazard I'm not going to handle even with gloves."" I told her as I backed away. 

""Oh, I can just go into your bathroom real quick."" she said dismissively.

""You certainly will not. You can go home, shower and come back if you'd like, but you're not scrubbing up in my customer's bathroom."" She made a ""fair enough"" facial expression and got up. She went out and talked to her husband (I could barely hear it as I was removing the disposable chair cover, which crinkles like mad). When I exited the piercing room, they were leaving. She remarked with a 'see you later.'

*Yeah fucking right* I thought.

A hour later, I get another customer, and it's totally her and her husband. The balls of this woman. I don't think I could have come back after being told to go wash semen off my crotch. Well, she did, and shaved it as well. I fitted her for a vertical, the piercing going quite smoothly (no shaved pun intended). 

Afterwards, she tipped me $20 in addition to the piercing commission and explained they were under the impression they might not be able to have sex for a while after she got pierced, so the sex in the parking lot was more of a ""Oh shit, how long without sex? Better get us one more in!"" decision.

I have a lot of stories from my various jobs, so if you'd like to hear from a particular field, just ask. Thanks for reading.

Enjoy!!!

Ballsack Billy

'Tis the holiday season in Lingerie Land, little bras all hang in a row, tinsel decorates the sales register and I am serving gifts with a smile. It is two weeks until Christmas a.k.a it's busy as fuck in retail world, new employees scatter the store like headless chickens while the veterans rake in the sales (trying to get that raise ohh yissss).

Being as it is a Saturday at around 3pm the place is ""bumpin"" I have children under racks, old biddies clipping coupons and men awkwardly looking at negligee for their aging wives. I am calmly yet quickly checking customers out and wrapping gifts like a madman when he comes sauntering down the isle. We'll call him Billy. Billy is about 50, 6ft tall, sporting a wonderful white beard just like St.Nick himself and he's in a dress...and has boobs???. I do a double take, oh yes he is indeed wearing a dress and has a bra on, get back to business (for the record I am totally ok with whatever you want to be gay, bi, lesbian, trans, blue, banana, whatever is awesome). I notice the customers are slightly alarmed, we're kind of in the bible belt so its expected but he's not doing any harm and has a lovely dooney and burke purse so I ignore him and let him wander among the bras.

It's 2:45pm and the coupon ends at 3pm...Utter madness erupts, I have lines of customers out the wazoo and my coworker (we'll call her Evil Bitch) isn't doing much to help. Evil Bitch starts telling customers that I'm going to hell because I don't believe in God and I don't celebrate Christmas. WUT?? EVIL BITCH SAYS WUUUT??? Not only is that entirely unprofessional her baby making evilness can't say shit about me. (Insert rant about having too many kids at 22 and having cps called yadda yadda yadda). Be generally pissed off now but still smiling like a champ. Billy's still hanging around the bras holding them up to himself in front of a mirror. cool.

Evil Bitch fucks off 20 minutes early for her break leaving me all on my todd trying to deal with the shark tank of customers; awesome. I'm doing the best I can when Billy ventures out of the safety net of bras, he is now directly to my left (yes by the trash can). On the left side of the registers we have a tall spinny tower of hair bows and shit for girls (mainly little girls) but whatever he can look at the bows and headbands I'm trying to fight this Chinese lady over an expired coupon.

Coupon lady buggers off after a stern word and I serve the next in line. This customer had no problem immediately telling me that Billy needs to leave..NOW. I start my spiel about how everyone is entitled to shop no matter what race, gener, sexuality...blah blah blahhhhhh. She cuts me off with a slap to me register and says no no NO. He's a pedo. It took me a while to figure this out she pronouced it like peh-doh and being scottish I'm like wtf is a pedo but then it clicks ohhhh you mean a pee-doh. Oh fuck WUT??? 

I press this lady for info quietly cause Billy is still to my left bending over looking at bows. She tells me to go look so I do...I wander away from my register (going towards my left) making an excuse out loud such as ""I'll just go get that for you ma'am"". I walk behind Billy and KABOOOOOOOM. HOLYMOTHERFUCKINGWHATISTHATOHMYGOD.

I'm staring at his ballsack...Billy is bent down so far in a shortish flowy dress that the back of the dress has lifted up his tall frame letting his ""Christmas bobbles"" dangle for all to see!!! What a gift ladies and gents..what a gift...

Anyways, professional mode activated, get back behind register nod to complaining lady and pick up the phone. Call LP (loss prevention) ""Hiiii this is HowlingBukowski in lingerie/juniors...Can you see me on your camera?""

""yeah why"" - LP doesn't like to be bothered on busy days, trying to catch thieves and shit...

""Do you see the bow/headband tower?"" Add in a little cough for good measure.

""Yeah, the beard guy?"" 

""Uh huuuuuuh look at back lower."" trying to be subtle cause billy is still there O.O

""Yeah yeah...Oh good lord. we'll be right there.""

""Thank youuuuuu""

Nod back at complaining customer give her coupons out the arse because her little girl just saw a ballsack before age 10. I see LP storming the gate (aka leaving the office) and breathe a sigh of relief phewwwwww. But what do I see out of the corner of my right eye???? Ballsack Billy is leaving, that bugger is getting away scot free, AND touching every piece of negligee on the tit on the way out. Slightly weirded out but it's better than winking at one eyed willy....LP is casually following him about 10-15ft behind and then he cuts through the dress department and disappears into the mall!!! We lost him. LP calls mall security as a heads up but that's all can be done.

I can firmly say this is not the last of Ballsack Billy.

Gneissisnice,159,,243,1qjhdd,,812,"I work in a college bookstore, as you could probably guess from the title. You might remember some other stories I've posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1l5mxv/the_customer_metamorphosis_theory/), [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1i7v3m/can_i_get_a_discount/) and [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15bc1z/i_want_it_now/). Today, I thought I'd share the story of why I stopped answering the phone at work (warning: very long).

Now it's November at the bookstore, and things are pretty much dead. We've sent all of our books back to the publishers and cleared out the store, so there's not much to do except tell the lazy procrastinators ""no, we don't have that book, yes I'm sure, why did you wait until November to buy your book?"". So when the phone rang, I was eager to have something to do. Boy, was I wrong about that. 

""University bookstore, this is Gneiss speaking, how may I help you?""

""Hi, I was wondering if you could pull up receipts for my daughters purchases since 2010"". 

WHAT? No, I can't do that. I explain that for us to find it, she would need the exact date and time for each purchase. Not that we would even be able to pull up a transaction from three years ago anyway. But then a thought occurs to me.

""Did you maybe order them online?"" I ask. She says that yes, she ordered everything online. Ah, that's a different story, and doable. But just because I can do it doesn't mean I should. Why does she need receipts from 8 semesters?

I ask her why, and she explains that her crazy ex-husband refuses to pay for her daughter's textbooks unless she can prove that she only spent money on books and not sweatshirts or other merchandise.

Oh. Uh, okay. I guess that kinda makes sense, in a way. Ignoring the obvious questions, like ""Why is your husband paying NOW, 4 years later?"" and ""He really wouldn't pay if your daughter did buy any logo merchandise?"", I decide to send her the emails.

I pull up her daughter's book orders and tell her that they only go back to Fall 2011. She asks why, and I don't know, but I guess that we either changed systems at that point or it just doesn't store the orders for more than a few years. I mean, how often would you need to pull up orders from that long ago? 

She's unhappy with that, but we proceed. She asks if I can cc her on the emails. Nope. I can only send them to her daughter's email that the order was placed under, and I tell her the email address to confirm that it's correct. Now that the orders have been fulfilled, I can't change any of the information. I do tell her that she can have her daughter forward her the emails though, and she agrees to that. As I start sending email after email, I inform her that one of her purchases has the status of ""Cancelled"".

""Why?"" she inquires.

""Probably because you cancelled the order."" I respond. 

8 emails and 30 minutes later, we're finally done. She thanks me and that's that.

Or is it? Apparently not, as it turns out. A few hours pass, and I hop on the front register as it gets somewhat busy. Just as I get off, the manager calls me over. ""Gneiss, phone for you"".

Phone for ME? That's weird. I pick it up. It's Her. 

""Hey Gneiss, you helped me out earlier. I just had a couple of questions. One, my daughter didn't get all of the emails! What's going on?"" 

I pull up her orders again, and I immediately see the problem. ""Your daughter changed her email, the first few orders went to her old email. I did say that the emails were going to that email"". 

""Oh. Can't you change the email?""

Sigh. ""No maam, as I explained earlier, we cannot change the email address. You should have your daughter check her old email and see if it's there""

""Ok. Well, can you send them again?"" SIGH. Sure, why not. It's not like I have anything better to do.

""Oh, and my other question. Are you SURE that you can't pull up anything earlier than 2011?"" I explain to her that yes, I'm sure. Here come the dreaded words: ""Can you check with your manager to make sure?"". Ugh. I put her on hold and go over to the assistant manager, who usually deals with web orders. I explain the situation, and he thinks the entire thing is absurd, but he agrees to check the woman's order. He asks for name and I tell her.

His eyes widen. ""HER???"" and suddenly, memories come flooding back to me. The woman that kept me on the phone for an hour last semester asking me to go over the price of every book her daughter had rented. The woman who calls once every couple of weeks with some kind of crisis. The woman who is already famous in the bookstore for being a major pain in the ass. It's HER! Now the situation makes more sense. He checks and tells me that we can't search for orders before 2011. 

I go back to the phone and tell her. She asks ""Who did you talk to? Was it Jay? I know Jay. Let me speak to him"". Sorry Jay. He grumbles as I pass him the phone, leaving him to be stuck with Her for another 30 minutes. 

But hey, the situation's out of my hands now, and all is resolved.

Nope. 

Two days pass and the phone rings again. ""Hey, remember me? I called yesterday, but you weren't in, so I decided to call again today"" I scream internally as I force myself to say ""Of course! What can I help you with today?"" ""Are you SURE I can't pull up orders from before 2011?"". I once again explain that I am absolutely positive. 

""Oh ok. Well, I have another question. I see that one of the orders was cancelled. That's not very good proof that I paid for the books, I was wondering if you could remove that status from the order"".

Now I'm dumbfounded. ""No maam, I can't do that. You didn't actually pay anything for that order because you cancelled it, and I can't change the status"".

Her: ""Why not?""

""...Because that would be lying? Besides, the order was completed 2 years ago, we can't change a finished order"".

""Oh ok. That's all I wanted to know, thanks""

Well, that's probably over now. It's Thursday and I'm not working again until Tuesday, hopefully it's all done now. Even though I'm off on Friday, I come in because it's the assistant manager's last day and I baked her cookies (I'm the best employee, I know). As I come in, the phone rings. I joke ""It's probably her"" and a coworker gets it. She grins, looks at me, and mouths ""It's Her! She asked for you!"". 

No. Absolutely not. I'm not even working today. My coworker takes the call, comes back 20 minutes later, and tells me ""She asked if we could pull up orders from before 2011. I said no, and she demanded to speak to a supervisor!"".

So now when the phone rings at work, I always ask for someone else to answer it, and if it is Her, tell her I'm not there.

caticorns,200,,188,1kk92q,,809,"Hello TFR! As I've mentioned before, I work in the deli department of a biz box retailer. Now, onto the tale. (Forgive my formatting, posting from my shit phone)

This just happened a few moments ago. We're extremely busy, and short-staffed as always. A black man, we'll call him Awesome Customer, or AC, go short, approaches the counter. 

AC: Excuse me, does EBT cover your party trays?

Me: No sir, I'm sorry.

AC: Oh, okay. Thank you anyways.

Now stupid me thought that would be the end of it. Oh no. I was dead wrong. I watch as AC goes to meet two women, one was about 7 months pregnant, we'll call her Baby Mama, or (lol) BM for short, and the other was covered in tattoos, so Tattoo Chick, or TC.

Ihear AC tell them EBT doeanlt cover our trays. The first thing BM does is yell ""Stupid white girl, just tellin' us no cause we black.""

Oh my god.

TC starts agreeing with her, all the while they both stare at me, like I'm the controller of all that is EBT and told them no because of their race.

I go back to waiting on customers, when I see AC approaching the other side of the counter, where my co-worker, T, was working. I hear AC ask him the same thing. Well T is a relatively new hire, so he asks me. I tell him the same thing. 

Of course, BM and TC see this, and start playing the race card again. 

Now T is a black guy, and a good friend of mine, so he runs to the floor to do some damage control. He talks to them for a few minutes, then they go on their way.

I ask him what had been said, and apparently they said I was a racist bitch because I told them EBT doesn't cover the trays, and that I was lying to them because they were black. He explained to them that I was not racist and that EBT only covers groceries, not deli trays.

Now, there's why I dubbed the man AC. Not ten minutes after they left, I had to run a few things to the customer service desk. As I'm talking to one of the clerks, someone taps me on the shoulder. It's AC. he says, ""I'm sorry about all of that. They tend to pull the race card when things don't go their way.""

frogfreek,90,,221,1nbjiq,,807,"Stick with me here. This happened last night. I am a manager at a fast food restaurant in not the best part of town. For a little more clarification, I am the only white female there. I came from a very different town, so I don't exactly fit in, and sometimes still have to fight the employees for respect. 

I have been having trouble recently with my job. I am moving soon, but I have nearly quit multiple times from the stress of having no employees listen to me, being disrespected, and feeling like I wasn't making an impact on this store.
Last night, I came in, I had extra employees and was told by my store manager I could give breaks, but it was okay that there would be extra hours worked. Cool beans, I can get this place nice and clean. 

Wrong, of course.

Every single person wanted the first break, and me being the manager, it was my decision to put only one person on break at a time in case we had a huge rush, as this store tends to get randomly.

 I put someone on break, and immediately Monique the Rude Employee (MRE) was complaining that she deserved the first break. She stopped listening to me, stopped doing tasks I assigned her. While this is happening, I had to slightly babysit some of the guys on staff.

No phones in front of house where customers can see!

I asked you multiple times to take out the trash, please do it. I really don't want to ask again.

No, you can't have free food, you all got terrible surveys last week. If you try to make food I will throw it away unless you pay for it with your own money.

This kept going. MRE kept complaining. She finally got her break though. Came back, and immediately started berating me again. I am stressed and tired from working nights and don't need to deal with this.

I text my GM and DM. I quit. I will stay until someone else can get here
I was done, I had threatened to quit before and I was going through with it. 
Five minutes later. Call from store manager.

Frogfreek, what is going on?

I explain how I'm tired of babysitting and how everyone is acting.

Okay Frogfreek, lets talk about this. I have trouble with them, I can't even imagine what it's like for you. I understand if you need to do this, but I know you are better than that. You are the manager, and if they don't want to listen, they are gone. You tell anyone else who gives you trouble that they can leave, and if you make them leave they are not coming back. Calling me won't help, so they shouldn't bother calling me. 

I'm crying at this point. I can't believe he stood up for me like that. I really love my job, but dealing with that kind of shit is stressful! So we are cool, I go back to work, and don't have any problems with anyone for a bit.

But! The story just got better.

MRE is on drive through. Takes an order. Lady comes to window, receives food, says its all wrong. MRE complains with lady (I'm making food, I didn't hear exactly what was going on until she told me the customer wanted to talk to me)
I go to the window. Yes ma'am, i see what's wrong, I will remake it for you immediately. Go ahead and park up front for me so I can bring it out to you. I was even planning on refunding this lady her money at this point. It was a simple mistake that could have been fixed if MRE had asked the lady to confirm her order with our fancy drive through screen.

I go to make the order and try to talk to MRE. Hey, just make sure you ask people to confirm the order, I know it adds a few seconds but we want everyone to leave happy.

Now at this point I'm being nice cause mistakes happen. She took this moment to rip me a new one, I'm a terrible manage, she deserved the first break, I can't tell her howqto do her job

MRE, you are going home right now. You are being rude, and it is getting out of hand. While I'm trying to explain to her that that means she is fired, she just keeps yelling over me, and leaves without closing her drawer or anything. In all honesty, fine by me. We are done. The night goes on unhindered from that oint forward.

*bows* thank you for being here for my performance. You are all wonderful people.

UPDATE!!!!!!! For those who asked. MRE was supposed to work with me last night (Saturday, the day after the incident). I had talked to my manager before my shift, he told me if she came in I should use her because I would probably be short people (no call no shows is a common thing at my store, yet no firings for it. Sigh), and also that if and when I had problems with her, I should send her packing and tell her not to come back unless we called her. 

Well my shift rolls around. I could write another whole post pertaining to last night in all honesty. What DID happen with MRE is her calling the store about 2 hours before her shift, apologizing, saying ""I'll work on my attitude if you work on yours"", and saying she didn't feel good and wasn't coming in. So hopefully that's the end of her.",The night I tried to quit and acquired firing powers.,1028,talesFromRetail
44uglennococo,77,,159,1g1kyw,,809,"Made a couple of posts on here, but this is one of my favourite retail stories to tell, of all time. Quick explanation: At this time, I was a lowly cashier, and we have Supervisors (one up) and Managers (two up) in my supermarket chain store, in Australia.

This particular day, was working Front End, which means a small register (no belt), cigarettes behind me, and was placed on the register closest to the door which opened into a large walkway. This area is known as 'Help Desk', mostly because it's closest to the door, but I still have to serve people.

A lady comes directly up to me, not bothering waiting in line, and just demands a refund in a very snooty tone. Call her Snooty Woman (SW). I had a customer, I asked her to wait for me to finish the transaction and I could assist her.

I finish my serving, turn to her, and ask in unwaveringly good-little-cashier-girl voice how I can help her on this day.

&gt;SW: I am demanding a refund.

&gt;Me: Okay, can I see your receipt and the items you're returning please?

Normal store procedure, have to check what's actually wrong i.e damaged, outdated, whatever the problem may be. She fussing, muttering, and plonks a bag on my counter without unpacking it. First off, it's a bag from another supermarket, not my own. This is usually pretty normal, I don't expect loyalty to this chain, so I'm like whatever. 
I'm forced to get three cans of diced tomatoes and a VERY long receipt out of the bag while she huffs and watches me.

Straight up, I realise something is wrong. We definitely do not stock the brand of diced tomato she has with her - I knew this as a fact, as I used to also do packing. I then looked at her receipt - IT WAS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORE. At this point, I'm confused, but being a nice person, I assumed maybe she'd perhaps grabbed the wrong receipt or something. 

&gt;Me: Ma'am, can you point out where the purchase for these cans are, on the receipt, please?

&gt;SW: RIGHT THERE *angrily stabs her finger randomly

&gt;Me: On this receipt?

&gt;SW: Yes, this one. I bought them here within the week. You have to give me a refund, it's all dented.

The can was a tad dented, sure, but how does that make it bad in the slightest? I manage to find the cans on the receipt, so she has bought them... but not from our store.

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, I think you've confused this store with [Other Australian chain]. This is [my store].

&gt;SW: Don't be stupid, girl! I bought them here! Now are you going to refund me or not!?

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'd like to point out that the receipt you have here is **not from this store**.

&gt;SW: OF COURSE IT'S THIS STORE! I BOUGHT THEM HERE! ARE YOU TRYING TO CHEAT ME FROM MY MONEY?

&gt;Me: The receipt clearly says [other store] at the top! You have to have the correct receipt if you want a refund.

&gt;SW: GET ME YOUR MANAGER THIS INSTANT AND THEY WILL GIVE ME A REFUND!!!

Typical customer fallback. I'm mad, but really, she's an idiot, I wasn't shaking or furious. I page the manager for 'Urgent customer assistance' and he comes straight away. This is K, from a previous post some may remember.

&gt;K: What's the problem?

&gt;Me: She brought in a receipt from [other store] and is trying to get a refund when we don't even stock the same item.

&gt;*K starts laughing*

&gt;SW: I want a refund for my purchase, FROM THIS STORE, for your apparent disregard for the appearance of my items. IMMEDIATELY. 

&gt;K: I'm sorry, but we don't even stock this brand, the receipt isn't from here, and we're not giving you money for this scam.

&gt;SW: YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A REFUND! I BOUGHT IT!

&gt;K: You did not buy it here. *swipes can over scan, it beeps a negative* I'm sorry but you'll have to take this scam somewhere else, hope it works out better for you.

And at this beautiful moment, K throws the (already dented) can *out of the store* in a perfect curve, where it lands outside in the walkway and rolls away. K then stares at the woman and just says

&gt;I think you'd better follow.

She leaves, grabbing her things, while screaming incoherently.


**TL, DR: Customer tries to get a refund for an item we don't carry, tries to say she bought it at my store by showing a receipt from another store, Manager then throws the item out of the store and tells her to follow.**

In traditional style many people are buying their frozen turkeys in hopes that they will thaw by next tursday and of course, stores have begun handing out coupons that will alter the price/pound for said turkeys.

C: yes, I'm only buying my turkey today and I want to use this coupon.

C: well I spend more than $25 every time I come here!!! Ill bring this reciept when I get the rest of my thanksgiving stuff!

M: *no* you *need* to spend $25 on *this order* if you'd like to use the coupon.

C: WELL I SPEND $200 HERE ALL THE TIME I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND $25 RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS COUPON! I WANT YOUR MANAGER! I DESERVE TO USE THIS COUPON BECAUSE I SHOP HERE ALL THE TIME.

Occasionally we get kids from the neighboring elementary school who come in after school and act like punks. One kid came in yesterday who looked IDENTICAL to the Scumbag Childhood Friend. We walked directly up to the Electronics counter where me and my co-worker were working. He approached this situation all wrong.

toxlab,181,,239,1gml24,,805,"Something reminded me of this tale of uncomfortable nonsense, thought I'd share:


I was working at a very high end steak house as a cook. The prices were high, and most of the clientele very well behaved. It was a premium joint: the folks who made it past the ""sticker shock"" of the menu were often quite appreciative of our efforts. We were providing cuisine, not food. 

The menu was very simple. Four or five cuts of steak, one chicken dish, and live Maine lobster. A few circus sized veggie portions, and that's all. We were very good at what we did. 

I was on saute, which meant I cooked the veggie sides, the chicken, and the lobsters. The lobsters were HUGE. I mean, bigger than your head huge. A fairly well known musician once described them as ""bigger than a puppy"". I think the smallest one I saw in a year of working there was four and a half pounds.

I had to dispatch these brutes. 

No simple trip into boiling water for these guys. You had to split them down the middle, put the halves on a baking tray, melted butter on the tails, remove the pouch like stomach from the head cavity, and add in heavy cream. 

The tasty bugs would still be flailing their legs around as you set them in a broiler. The cavities would release air as they died. This meant you were sticking a screaming animal into a fire. The tiny little ""aaaaaaah"" that came out was disconcerting. Especially after you poured in the cream. Imagine filling a screaming animal's face with liquid. You got ""aaaaaaaahgbgbgbb"". 

***EVERY. FREAKING. TIME.***



But, like anything, it comes easier with practice. You stop flinching after a while. 

Now, this steak house doesn't have a printed menu. Instead, the have a cart that is rolled up to the table. Well heeled servers describe each item, even providing a provenance for your beef... (holding up 18 oz steak) ""This meat was raised by XYZ in XYZ town for our exclusive stockyards.""

The ""great reveal"" was the lobster. After describing everything else, They would swoop the five or six pound critter off its silver tray. Lobsters do not enjoy being held. They show this by opening and closing their tails toward their bodies. Underwater, this allows them to escape from predators. On land, this means they are slapping their tails against their bodies as you struggle to hold on. A food critic once called it, ""being threatened with a live animal."" It was certainly dramatic.

The servers would call it back. ""Whack a six."" This meant dispatch a six pounder. I did this all night long. Lobster blood is thick and grey, and once it hit the cutting board (or your jacket) it turned into grey jello. You are covered in slime, putting a bisected arthropod into a firey furnace. 

Whenever new hires were shown around the restaurant, I would make sure to have a lively one ready for the knife. ""Hey, welcome. I'm toxlab. I kill lobsters. Like this guy, here. His name is Kenneth. Hi, Kenneth! How are you? Would you like some lemons and melted butter? Sure, I just have to do one thing first..."" **WHAM!** Knife through the carapace. Split the tail. Swing it around. ""What's that? Not your head? but what if I just...**WHAM!** Butter, cream, oven. Hey look, he's dancing in the broiler.

I would amuse myself with these little dialogues. Especially when they got to the ten pound and up range. Those suckers fought back. I would pet them and make up back stories for these guys. Whole telenovelas were acted out for the amusement of my cohorts. 

One week, we got the biggest lobster I'd ever seen. I was dying to whack him. It would be like landing a marlin. I made sure he was covered with wet newspapers to keep him feisty. He wouldn't be an easy sell. The price per pound put it almost into the thousands. He would be a gourmet treat for four people or more. 

The order finally came through. Time to dispatch Big Daddy. YES! I ran to get him. 

I cradled it with both arms. My coworkers were amused. They knew I had been waiting for this.

Little did they know, I already had a scenario figured out. He was the ""new fish"" in jail, and I was the sexually reprehensible Victor Wolf. ""Hey there"", I patted his shell. ""things in here is mighty dangerous. I can help you out, if you know what I mean...""  The other cooks are snickering. It moves forward a little. I drag it to the edge of the board. ""Oh, yeah. Feisty. I like that."" I drag it to the edge and start humping the back of it's tail. ""Say my name, baby. Call me daddy. Yeah. Yeah."" Knife goes up, overhand psycho style. **WHAM!** I pin him to the board. I look over. My coworkers are looking back at me, smiling.

And then I notice. At the edge of the serving window, behind us, is a little girl.

She is petting one of the cart lobsters.

She has a look of pure horror on her face. One hand is by her side. The other is touching the cart lobster's back. Her mouth is wide open. 


""Oh!! Oh God! Oh God!"" I stammer. The giant lobster is trying to flap his enormous tail. I have to finish cutting him in half. Then the butter and the cream. By the time I've finished this, she was running across the room. I wince in preparation for the biggest ass chewing ever.

My guess is she just didn't have the words to describe what she saw. They ate, paid and left.


I toned down my act after that. I imagine it made for some very entertaining therapy sessions down the line...

berdiesan,100,,192,1ffayr,,804,"Ok, this one happened a few years back when I worked for A Home Improvement Retailer. ..

I was helping the associates in window coverings because they were slammed -- all of them were with special order customers, cutting window blinds/shades, etc.-- when I noticed a kid messing with the blind displays. It was basically a free-standing window frame with a different working blind inserted on either side of the frame, sturdy but meant to be used the way you would use a window covering.

This kid, about 7yrs old, is holding onto the cords on either side of the display as if he's waterskiing, leaning waaaay back with all his weight on the cords. I look around for a parent, but of course the kid is unsupervised, so I walk over and say, ""Hey, kid, you can't do that. You might get hurt."" The kid stares at me, stands up straight and drops the cords to run off towards a 30-ish man looking at display books.

I think nothing of the whole exchange and get back to trying to help out in the department when I feel a heavy series of tap-tap-taps on my shoulder. ""Did you just tell my kid to stop playing on the display?"" I turned around and this man is looking at me with a very neutral expression. ""Yes, he was pulling so hard I thought he might pull the display over onto himself,"" I said.

I was gobsmacked, as they like to say across the pond. Just... wow. I didn't even know what to say.

Our procedure for new rolls where they have to be baked for 15min and then frosted and put up on the hot plate for twenty minutes and then they get replaced with new fresher rolls. 

When working towards the back end of a dinner rush we had one customer come in and ask us very politely if we had any non frosted rolls as he was a diabetic and could have a little bit of a roll and give the rest to his son. I told him that wouldnt be a problem but it would take about 7 minutes for the next set of rolls to come out. 

Well apparently that was the code word for him to lose his mind, he looked at me and turned a bright shade of red and demanded to know why he had to wait at all. I explained the companys policy and that we didnt keep rolls unfrosted unless they were special large orders. He demanded to see the manager which unfortunately was me at that moment being the shift lead. Of course this makes the man more irrate and he threatened to call the local news watch dog program, that investigates corrupts businesses and sketchy business practices, and report me specifically to them for ""diabetic discrimination"".

winter_storm,152,,220,1l1t6w,,803,"Yesterday when I got off of work (9:30 PM), I stopped across the street at the grocery store on my way home. I had about 12 items in my cart, so, as the selfcheck lanes were already closed, I rolled up to the 15 items or less lane.

I told her, ""Ma'am? This is 15 items or less, here.""


She rudely told me to mind my own business!


So, since I had just had a hell of a fucking bad day working customer service, and didn't feel like putting up with her crap, I wheeled my cart around the lanes until I was in front of her. Then I pushed all of the crap she had already put on the belt out of my way, and proceeded to put my purchases on the belt ahead of hers.


This is when the cashier noticed we were there, and arrived back at the till.


Bitch starts yelling about how I cut in line, and she should go first, and how dare I, etc.

FredFltStn,138,,246,1qv8tj,,794,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I love fireworks. I got into the business because I love fireworks. I spend my vacation from my real job selling fireworks in a parking lot because I love fireworks (that, and it pays really well). I spend months researching fireworks, attending firework demos, and watching videos of new fireworks. Please don’t walk into my business and try to talk shit to me.

One of my employees grabbed me and asked me for some help. He had been showing a guy around the tent, and the guy was asking some questions that he couldn’t answer. He was apparently also kind of being a dick about it.

I walked up the to the guy and introduced myself.

**ME:** Andy told me you had some questions. Is there anything I can help you with?

**GUY:** Yeah, I was looking for some good stuff, but you guys don’t carry anything good.

Note to potential shoppers, if you’re looking to piss me off, this would be the way to do it.

**ME:** If you’re talking about legal fireworks, I carry some of the best stuff imported into the US. Is there something specific that you’re looking for?

**GUY:** I usually shop at &lt;other company&gt;, I just thought I’d stop by to see what you had, but their stuff is definitely better. I wanted to pick up some mortars, but I guess I’ll have to make the trip to the coast.

**ME:** Really? What mortar pack are you planning on getting?

**GUY:** I always get &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars. They’re definitely the best you can buy in the US. I'm not surprised that you don't have them, since you're just a tent.

**ME:** Wow, you have shitty taste in mortars, and those definitely AREN’T the best in the US. Hell, they’re not good enough for me to carry in my store.

**GUY:** You have no idea what you’re talking about.

**ME:** Really. &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars are imported by the Beihai Kylin Fireworks Co, located in the Guangxi province of China. Of course the fireworks are actually made in one of hundreds of factories located in Liuyang, a province of Hunan. It’s a 1 ¾ inch diameter 48 gram canister shell. Sadly, it only gets about 125 ft of lift out of the tube, because they skimped on the lift charge. 

**GUY:** But…

**ME:** The shells are also hand packed, rather than machine packed, which probably explains why the breaks aren’t symmetrical. That means it was made at an older factory. That’s probably why they sell them so cheap and will put any label you want on them. Then again, it’s only a 48 gram shell…and not even the best 48 gram shell that Beihai Kylin imports. 

**ME:** If that’s really the type of stuff you’re looking for, I probably won’t have anything you’d like. Thanks for stopping by.

I turned around and walked away from the guy.

He actually did end up shopping for a while, and picked up a lot of stuff from me. Sadly, he didn’t have any other questions for me.

Resplendent_Butthole,44,,183,1mv0r8,,797,"I work at a big box electronics store. You know how it is, video games, home theater, gadgets galore, etc. I'm not a salesman, to be clear; I'm a Loss Prevention Associate (Guy who watches out for thieves and impotently calls police when I find one).

As you might imagine, this fosters an attitude of mistrust when working. I wouldn't call it paranoia, but it's not far off.

So imagine my reaction yesterday when I saw this kinda ghetto-ish kid walking around the store very, very slowly. He makes his way from the Laptops/Desktops department to the Video Games department to the Home Theater Department, positively trudging. I have seen octogenarians with more pep in their step. Naturally, I assume he's casing the place, looking for an opportunity to snatch something. I leave the office in the back (where all of the monitors are) to go follow this guy in person.

I catch up with him in Home Theater. But he's not trudging around anymore, he's just standing there, looking at one of the non-glasses 3D TVs, transfixed, as though hypnotized. On the TV is playing a nature documentary about cheetahs. I think it was a Discovery Channel DVD.

I walk a little ways away from him and wait. He's not moving. No, scratch that, he's swaying, extreeeemely slowly, and I realize he's making some kind of small noise or talking to himself.

*Okay, maybe not a thief, maybe just a crazy homeless guy* I think to myself, and walk a little closer.

Now I have a profile view of him, and it all makes sense. Tears are streaming down the side of his face. His pupils are **gigantic**. This dude is tripping his balls off.

I walk a little closer, and say, ""Are you okay, sir?""

""No,"" he says, his voice quivering with emotion. ""The little baby cheetah's gonna die. Because his mama doesn't even know he's gone.""

I had to stifle a chuckle. Yeah, I've tripped too, and I can only imagine what it would be like to be super high and watching the grimness of mother nature on one of the 3D, Super HD TV's. ""Wait here,"" I said. He barely nodded.

I returned a little while later with my the extra chair from my office. To the back, I affixed a piece of printer paper, on which I wrote ""Quality Inspector. Do Not Disturb.""

He absently thanked me for the seat. I went about the rest of my shift occasionally checking on him, to make sure he hadn't lost his shit completely. And eventually, he seemed to come down, and wandered out of the store in a daze.

So that's the story of how I made sure this one guy had a pretty okay trip.","""Are You Okay, Sir?""",980,talesFromRetail
rumplesplitskin,95,,174,1kul4l,,797,"It was a late Saturday night just a few moments before closing. Thankfully for the girl in this story our shop is usually empty at this time at the weekends. 

So its about 9.50pm and we close at 10pm. I'm just about to go out and close up outside on the forecourt i've not had a customer in the past ten mins when a car pulls in and a lone girl of only eighteen or so comes in wearing a short summer dress with a pullover tied round her waist. She looked kinda uneasy when she came in and she was pacing back and forth behind one of our isles. 

I started to wonder if something was wrong and if she needed help, she kept looking over at me like she wanted to get something but was too embarrassed to ask for something like condoms. Then as she walked past the isle i seen a little trickle of blood running down her leg. The poor girl had obliviously taken her period and needed tampons but with me being a guy she was embarrassed for me to serve her.

So i gave my boss(Sally) in the office a buzz who's a young(ish) woman herself and asked her to cover the tills as i was going out to lock the pumps. While at the same time pointing out the situation to her with the girl who by this time was nearly in tears. Sally looked over at the girl, winked at me and told me to finish up outside then lock the doors.

I made my way out the back door so the poor girl did not get even more embarrassed and when i had finished locking up outside she had gone. Sally thanked me for me for showing some tact and told me the girl also asked her to thank me too. A few days later when i had forgotten all about this a card was delivered to the shop thanking the and i quote ""the nice bald guy"" 

Yeah thanks love...

Anywho, I'm running some returns, and there are 2 siblings in the store, one is a 15 year old girl and her younger brother, probably 11 or 12. I catch the brother trying to stick a video game manual into his shorts and I just stare at him with murder eyes till he puts it back, and I go about my return running, mulling over how to exact delicious justice. The girl comes up with a rental, so I go behind the counter and help her. After I tell her when her movie was due back I said ""Oh, and tell your brother the next time he tries to steal video game manuals, I'm not renting to him anymore."" She looks shocked, gathers him up, and walks out of the store.  I worked in a pretty affluent area so its not like this kid needed to steal.

About 5 minutes later, the brother is being dragged into the store by the arm by his mother. She comes up to me and asks if he really attempted to steal, to which I reply ""Yes, it was the manual for a wii baseball game."" The woman starts hollering at her son, grounds him for a month on the spot, apologizes profusely to me, smacks him upside the head, and walks out, all the while berating him.

regalfurpig,68,,199,1hljc3,,797,"So this story happened a year or two ago during a very prominent trade show in the industry I work in. The hotel that our company was staying at was kind enough to offer free drinks at their bar from 3-5 pm during happy hour and we are talking unlimited free drinks. Most of the days that we were there I had to work past the cut off time but finally I was able to get out early enough and run back to the hotel just in time to make it before 5. 

I was literally the last person in line at 4:55 when a security guard stood in behind me to cut off the line as it would be past 5 by the time I made it to the front to be served. Cue asshole douche bag (we'll call him ADB) who walks up to the security guard at 4:59 demanding to be served. The security guard informs him politely that the line is cut off for today and he is more than welcome to come back tomorrow for free drinks.

ADB wasn't having any of that and starts berating the security guard for being too stupid to tell that it wasn't yet 5. He demands to speak to the manager of the hotel (a small and soft spoken woman) who gives him the same reason why the line cuts off before 5. He continues to screech and his voice only gets louder as I'm standing right next to him waiting for my ears to start bleeding. Next he dials their corporate office on his mobile and continues to scream about the lousy customer service and how stupid and rude the staff have been. 

I was about half the size of this guy and not a very outspoken person but I have worked many waitress jobs in my time and have experienced firsthand how awful and embarrassing it is to be berated like this in public and still have to be polite and courteous so something in me just snapped. ADB was still on the phone at this point and before I knew it I was in his face shouting at him, ""Shut the FUCK UP OK?! Just shut the fuck up!! You're obviously getting your drink after treating the waitstaff like dirt so quit screaming in my ear, quit being an asshole, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!!"" 

He was instantly quiet with his mouth open and his phone just dropped to his side. Clearly no one had ever put him in his place before. I turned around, a bit red once I realized the whole bar was staring at me but then the person in front of me turned around and thanked me. I apologized for being so loud but they insisted that they wished they had done the same. I explained that I know how it feels after working in restaurants for so long at which point ADB piped in to try to say he had once worked in a restaurant too. I turned around and said with as much venom in my voice as I could muster, ""then you should know to treat people with a little decency, shouldn't you?"" which shut him right up. 

I was still shaking when I ordered my TWO drinks (I needed it after that) and sat down at a table but it felt pretty awesome to put a rude asshole in his place. I was met with smiles and winks by other people in the bar for the rest of the night. 

**TL;DR Asshole douche bag treats hotel staff like garbage and I snap and shut him down so hard I even surprised myself.**

Drunken_Black_Belt,151,,238,19ngr1,,793,"So I work as a Security guard in a big corporate office. It's shit. Awful job.  But sometimes, we get to create a little fun with ourselves.  For example, our phone number is (XXX) XXX-5555.  The local CableSight office has the same number, except the last 4 digits are 6666.  Needless to say, about once or twice a day, we get calls meant for Cablesight. (Hopefully the mods will allow this post since it's customer service *related*)

Now when we answer the phone in the office, we typically say ""*NameofBuilding* Security. This is Drunken_Black_Belt. How can I help you?""  Now for most people, this is a BIG clue that they in fact didn't call Cablesight.  Some will hang up, but most will go 

Person: I think I have the wrong number. I'm trying to reach Cablesight.

Me: You want to dial 6666, this is 5555

Person: Oh ok thank you.

Simple as that.  And they are off on their merry way to complain about whatever issue they are having, to the right people.  However, every so often, you deal with someone. Someone so stupid, it hurts you way down in their soul.  And naturally, you must fuck with those people. Take them down so many pegs, that they will be envious of pirates with peg-legs.  This, is a story of one of those people.

So it's an average day. I'm in the office, working, being a boss. Looking sauve, in my cheap, standard issue suit.  The phone rings. A random number.  My hand, deftly reaches out for the phone. I tense up, ready to spring into action! Is there a fire?  Someone having a heart attack? Or, god forbid, did someone ignore the stop signs and run their $100,000 Audi into another car. (Happens WAY more often than you'd think).

Me: *Name of Bulding* Security. This is Drunken_Black_Belt. How can I help you?

Gullible Idiot:  Yes Hi my name is Gullible Idiot and I'd like to know why I have so many charges rental charges on my bill.

Me: Oh Ma'm Im sorry this is a security office. You have the.

GI: (Not paying attention)  We don't ever rent anything, so I don't get why there is a $55 charge extra on here.

Me:  Ma'm. You have the wrong number.

GI: What?

Me: This is 5555, you want 6666.  

GI: Thats what I dialed.

Me: Obviously not, as we are currently talking and I am not a Cablesight employee.

GI: Well I just want to talk to someone about my bill can you transfer me to the bills department?

Me: One moment ma'm.

So naturally I turned to my co worker, and gave him a devilish grin. The time for fuckery had begun.

Me: Hi Ma'm I understand you are having issues with your bill. I'm looking at the charges right now.

Now I assumed, correctly as it turned out, that this woman would think I somehow knew her account without asking her any questions.  Somehow the fact that no cable company in the history of ever has picked up with a live person on the first ring had escaped her notice, so maybe she wouldn't notice I just magically knew who she was.

GI: Yes I just don't understand why there is this charge for $55.

Me: Well it's typical for a rental fee for some movies, let's check them out.  

GI: Well we didn't rent anything.

Me: Well give me a second.  Ok it says here that last weekend 2 movies were rented from your cable box. Each film was $26, plus tax would make it $55.

GI: What movies? And how come they are so much?

Me: Well, says here one was titled ""Chicks with Dicks 7"" and the other is ""Tranny Heaven vol 18"".

GI: What?  What type of movies are those?

Me: Well ma'm, they are adult movies, featuring Transexuals.  

GI: WHAT?  WE DON'T WATCH THAT KIND OF FILTH!!

Me: Ma'm I'm not here to judge.  All I know is that last saturday someone rented these movies on your cable box.

GI: That's impossible.

Me: Your phone number is *reads phone number off caller ID screen*?

GI: Yes.

Me: Well we have cable box *makes up random serial code* assigned to that number and that's where the rentals came from. Perhaps you'd like to talk to your family and see who rented these?

GI: Well I'll have to, it has to be a mistake.

Me: Well ma'm, hopefully they'll listen to you, because you sure didn't listen to me in the beginning of the call.

GI:  What?  I don't follow.

Me: Anything else I can help you with?  

GI: Umm... no thank you.  I have to go sit down for a bit.

Me: Welp, thanks for calling Cablesight, have a wonderful day!



At which point I hang up and start losing it. My cowoker had stuffed his tie in his mouth to keep from cracking up.  I was expecting her to call back all day yelling and screaming when she figured it out, but nothing ever came of it.  

**TL;DR  Dude looks like a lady! YEA YEA!**


**Edit:  So I've been messaged asking to take down this post, and change the title and repost.  Apparently a lot of people are reporting it as offensive. And the the subreditt /r/TransphobiaProject has made a post about me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/comments/19oe1b/casual_transphobia_in_rtalesfromretail/)   So this is my response.  I feel bad if anyone took any offense to this.  None was intended.  However I won't remove it of my own volition. Hope this doesn't put pressure on the mods.  But I don't see anything offensive about it.  To me, Transexual porn is no different than any other fetish porn involving a physical preference.  If I had said it was Pegging Porn, I'm sure I'd be getting messages from Pro-Peggers, saying they feel I'm being offensive to their preferences. (Also that's just a general point. I realize there is a difference between being born transgender, and enjoying a physical act.  You all hopefully see my point though).  In my different jobs, especially when I worked LP in a store that sold lingerie, I've had to deal with Straight, Gay, Lesbian, Trans, White, Black, Tall, Short, (etc etc) people.  At no point did any of it make a difference to me.  Only time it ever caused an issue was when I had to write up an employee for some remarks after we had a man who lived his life as a woman use the fitting rooms in the lingerie store.  A buddy of mine is someone who feels like he is a woman in a man's body. But I don't even think of that, except the time he told a girl at work she had a hairier chest than he did. Now that was fucking funny.  My point here, is that I think it's a little ridiculous that people are getting so bent out of shape over this. I can't even begin to pretend that I can sympathize with someone who is living transgender.  It's just not physically possible for me. I can empathize though. I'm sure it's a tough, confusing issue to have to live with.  But at the same time, that doesn't mean that every mention is a jab at you.  If I had said something like ""Transgenders are mutants and deserve to be killed"", then yea, bring on the hate mail. That's a bigoted, hateful statement.  And anyone who would say that deserve to be hated.  But I would think we can all agree that that is not what I said at all.  A veiled *CLERKS* reference, while mentioning a type of porno that is outside of ""Vanilla"" porn, but still available for rental (as far as I am aware) from cable companies.  All that being said, I will freely admit that I am the type to find nothing taboo as far as humor.  I'm a fat guy, but love fat jokes.  I firmly believe humor will get you through anything. I really hope this has cleared things up, but urge anyone who has found this offense, or anyone from /r/TransphobiaProject to contact me if they have any questions and wish to discuss this like reasonable adults.  Sorry again to the mods. Remove it if you must, but it's my choice not too.   Thank you all and have a good day.**",Security Shenannigans: How the difference between the #'s 5 and 6 can lead to Tranny Porn.,1031,talesFromRetail
Martsigras,93,,238,1lmwqy,,794,"My mam works in a supermarket on the tills, and has done so for about 14 years. She started about 3 months after the shop opened so she is one of the longest serving staff members there. My mam also gets on really well with everyone, staff and customers, and everyone knows my mam is not one for bullshit.

About 4 years ago a new manager started in the supermarket, we'll call him **MD** for massive dickhead. MD came from an inner city job where I guess you had to fight to make a name for yourself. The supermarket my mam works in is in a small town so they were unprepared for his shenanigans.

On one fateful morning my mam was one of two checkout staff on duty. My mam was counting tills, getting them ready for when the other staff came in. The other girl was serving customers. While counting one particular till, my mam noticed a small queue forming on the one active till. My mam went over to a different, ready till and asked for the next customer. After serving that customer the girl on the other till tells my mam she can handle the rest and to go back counting the tills.

My mam gets back to the till she was counting and MD is standing there, she also noticed she left the cash drawer open. He says  

&gt;**MD** ""Can you show my how to count tills please""  
**mam** ""of course""  

so she starts counting this till from scratch. The till is down €40. My mam is a little flustered at this as her tills are only ever off by a couple of cents, if ever. My mam said  
&gt;**mam** ""I must have miss counted, I'll try again"".


Again the till is €40 down. At this point my mam is close to tears and says  
&gt;**My mam** ""I don't understand... this till should not be off!""  
**MD** ""I noticed the cash drawer was open and no-one was here. Because of this, someone has obviously taken money and then ran, unless the culprit is still here *very pointedly*. Go home. You are suspended until an investigation can be made. Come in tomorrow morning for a meeting"".

My mam left the shop in floods of tears. She offered to pay out of her own pocket but was told again to just leave. That night a friend of my mam's who also works at the shop as a supervisor called and said  
&gt;**friend** ""Martsigras's Mam... I have something to tell you about what happened today but you need to swear you will keep it under your hat! we were all told to not contact you about anything or we would be suspended. MD took the money out of the till. He is doing this to make an example of you"".

My mam thanked her for calling and atleast she knew what the score was for the meeting the next day.

During the meeting MD berates my mam relentlessly about stealing and basically makes a show of her. In the end he told her that it was him who took the money from the till, and that it was a lesson. He also told her she was suspended for a week.

This was a Friday, and that night my parents went out for a drink to try and take my mam's mind off what happened. While out, a friend of my parents', a lawyer, noticed my mam was not herself and asked what was wrong. My mam first said it was nothing and then said

&gt;**Mam** ""James... can I get your opinion on something from a legal point of view please""  
**James** ""of course! what happened?"".

My mam told him the tale and he said

&gt;**James** ""... wow. You know you can nail him and the whole shop to the wall for what he did to you?""  
**Mam** ""I don't want money, I just want an apology"".

James told my mam he would call over to the house the following day with his laptop and he would write up a legal letter that she can give in to the shop.

The letter was written up the following day and on Monday morning my mam walked into the shop, asked for the head supervisor and said ""please make sure (head of chain) gets this"" and walked back out. That night the head of the chain phoned my mam and started falling over himself with apologies about what happened. He also said the suspension was lifted. My mam cut him off and said

&gt;**Mam** ""I am not interested in suing, all I want is for MD to apologise to me"".  
**head** ""of course of course!!"".

The following day my mam received a letter of apology signed from MD and my mam called up the head again

&gt;**Mam** ""maybe I didn't make myself clear. I want a face-to-face apology. I will not accept a letter that, frankly, anyone could have written. I want him to apologise to me and I want him to look me in the eye when he does it!""

The following day my mam got her apology and a few weeks later MD was no longer at the supermarket. The head never forgot about this and has since made my mam's life at that shop a whole lot more bearable. Woe betide any manager who tries that shit with her again!

TL;DR: Dickhead manager at supermarket tried to frame my mam for stealing and learned the hard way to not fuck with my ma

dsboobaloo,116,,149,1ec2xm,,790,"One day I got a call from LP letting me know that the customer coming up the elevator was a frequent shoplifter that they hadn't been able to catch yet. They told me to leave her alone and not offer her assistance so that she could just do her thing because they really wanted to catch her this time. All they told me it was an older lady with glasses.

This lady steps off the elevator and it's a lady in her 70s wearing a brightly colored muumuu. Definitely not what I was expecting. She is carrying reusable shopping bags and walking with a limp. I do as I was told and leave her be while trying to hide and watch her in action. I just can't believe this is the woman they are talking about.

She goes in a corner in the home department and takes a Wahl clipper set off the wall and puts it into one of her bags. She then proceeds to walk around the department grabbing miscellaneous items and putting those into her bags. She doesn't even look around to see if anyone's watching her. This lady had some balls. Guess she figured no one would expect an old woman to be stealing.

She then grabs a body pillow and brings it up to me to check out. I ring her up and as I am handing her the bag, I look down in her other bags because I am curious to see all that she grabbed. There was all kinds of kitchen items and small electrics. I finish up her transaction and she starts to head towards the elevator. She picks up a set of sheets on the way and puts those in the bag with the pillow.

I can't believe she has taken all of this so far and so I call LP and let them know she is on the elevator and give them a list of everything that I saw her take. Once off the elevator, she starts walking toward the exit and pulls out some wire cutters and clips the wire on the Michael Kors handbags and grabs the one she wants and keeps walking.

As she steps outside, LP is waiting for her. I hurried downstairs to watch them catch her. She is playing dumb the entire time. She is taken into the office while the cops are called. She ended up with about $700 worth of merchandise on her. She claimed she has Alzheimer's and doesn't know what she was doing.

She was given a court date but not arrested. When her court date comes around, LP is there to testify. It seemed like the judge was just going to fine her and let her off. As LP is walking out of the courtroom, the lady flipped her off. Luckily the judge saw and had her arrested on the spot.

TheEmeraldKnight,48,,154,1k6wi3,,789,"Hey TFR, long time lurker, first time posting.

Short background: 
I work at the local movie theater, usually behind the concession stand. During the summer we usually get a few day cares a week that take the kids out to the most recent childrens movie. It's great when they call ahead to let us know they're coming, even greater when they say they're not buying concessions. I know it's better for the theater if they do buy stuff, but honestly I die a little inside when I hear I'm going to have to make snack packs for 100 kids. 

Story:
On a fine Thursday morning, we get a call saying there's about 27 kids coming to see one of the morning showtimes of Despicable Me 2. Great, easy enough. However, the kids are bringing their own money to buy concessions. Not a problem, mornings usually aren't that busy and children are usually some of the nicest and most polite customers we get. 

The day care arrives, and I go through about three kid's orders when this one kid comes up with a decent sized wad of bills in his hand. He orders a drink, some popcorn, a hotdog, and a box of candy. Now, this kid is about 9 or 10 years old and I know he can't carry all that himself. I ask him if he would like a tray to help carrying that to his movie, and naturally he says yes. So I go get a tray and help him put all his food and drinks into it. As he turned from the concession stand I saw all of the kids' faces around him light up with amazement. Many began to whisper about the kid and his tray, ""look at how much Billy got!"" 

The next kid asks for a box of Sour Patch Kids. I get the candy and am finish ringing him up when he sheepishly asks for a tray. Even though we both know he doesn't need it, his face is full of hope and I just can't crush this kid's dreams. He gets his tray and has the widest grin as he goes to stand by Billy. For the remaining ~10 orders, about 8 or 9 of them asked for a tray even if they only just had a drink or a box of candy. I smiled and watched them all go off to their movie feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.

pandamunch3r,209,,158,19iptc,,786,"Does anyone else get this all the time?

I work in a shop that specialises in board games. I always get customers who think they have the brightest kids in the world. So when it comes to games that are suggested to be more suitable for children a few years older than theirs, they think it should be fine because they are smart enough to figure it out themselves.

Had a customer come into the store and ask about a particular board game that she saw in a news article the previous week called 'Ticket to Ride'. 

I told her it was an excellent game, as I have played it heaps and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Then, she starts telling me that it was for her grandchildren to play with her. 

I ask for their age and they were about 2-4 years younger than the suggested age for the board game. I go on to mention this and start recommending games that I believed would be suitable for their age and that they would really enjoy. 

She keeps going back to the original board game she came in for and questions me as to whether or not her children would be able to understand the game. (How am I supposed to know?!) 

I politely replied by repeating the recommended age as shown on the box and repeated my experience with the game in saying that the rules are fairly straightforward, but it was the strategy that was needed to be put in the game that required older players. I said that the kids might get disinterested by it since they will probably lose most of the games against adults and not be able to understand why and how they could change the way their strategy in the game. 

She dismisses my argument and says, ""they are really bright for their age and so it should be fine,"" then proceeds to the counter to purchase it. 

2 weeks later, I answer a call in the store and a lady asks about Ticket to Ride and how she had purchased it and couldn't understand the rules and was too complicated for her and her grandchildren to follow and wanted a refund for the game. I suggested watching some videos online of demo games if the rule book was too complicated (which, frankly, isn't; the rules are very straightforward and easy to follow). She claims to have done so and still couldn't understand and asked for a refund for a game that she had opened and attempted to play because apparently, the girl serving her in the store (me) told her that it was suitable for really young children (which I never said). 

I confronted her and said that I remember serving her and I did recommend other games more suitable for her grandchildren's age and that I could not do anything once the product has been opened.

JacOfAllTrades,147,,145,15syvf,,789,"This is in response to [another post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15rb56/some_douche_poured_olive_oil_all_over_our_blind/)

We had customer about a year ago try to commit fraud using bottled fragrance oil (the kind you put reeds in to make a room smell like a garden took a shit). I watched her pick up a display bottle, look around shadily, then pour it on the ground. I called stock to bring comet and paper towels out as I watched her sit on the display ledge (16"" high), then slide herself down to a sitting position on the ground, then lay down on the floor and start moaning. I just started laughing, as did the customer who watched it happen. As she's laying on the ground moaning (no one cared, seriously [*I'll explain in a minute]), I first call the ASM from the back, then the municipal police who are in the mall, and asked the customer I was helping to stay (so we can file an incident report).

Well my ASM comes out, sees her, and also starts laughing. He laughs even louder when I explain everything. The louder he laughs, the louder she moans. The cops show up maybe two minutes after I called, see her on the floor moaning, and must choke back laughter. They ask what's up and I tell them, at which point one of the cops also starts laughing.

This woman is over it. She starts yell-moaning, ""I'm gonna sue!"" The cop who managed to not laugh asks if she wants to file a report, and the woman says yes and makes up some story which the cop writes down. Then her partner walked over and said to this woman, ""You have two options: get up and walk away or we will file this report then arrest you for filing a fraudulent claim."" Of course she tries to kick up a fuss, ""You can't do that! I'm injured! Blah blah blah."" That's when the cop breaks to her the very thing that had us all laughing, ""Ma'am, these floors are unfinished concrete, the oil makes it sticky, not slippery."" He then sticks his shoe on the oil spot and tries to slide it, but it doesn't move. She tried, ""That's what I meant! I tripped because my shoes got stuck!"" The officer then walks straight across the spot, no problem. He stares her dead in the face and says, ""I gave you your options, you have thirty seconds to make a choice before I arrest you.""

She figured the jig was up and started toward the door, her back and side saturated in oil, she reeked from 20 feet away. As she makes the walk of shame out of the store, the ASM hollers, ""We have your information, never set foot in this store again!""

I took solace in the fact that her car and clothes would smell like mission fig forever, and cleaned the damn oil off of the floor.","If you're going to commit fraud, at least do it well",934,talesFromRetail
zidace,217,,204,1i80wx,,785,"So, at work yesterday, I had quite the customer.  It was a reletively peaceful day for a Friday, but there's always just that one customer that comes in and ruins everything.  

Customer is buying 2 cartons of cigarettes and some drinks.  The total is about $100.

**Me** - Ma'am, I will need to see your license since you are using a card and the purchase is over $75.

**Customer** - No you don't. (proceeds to swipe her card)

**Me**- (canceling the transaction)Actually I do, as it is corporate policy, may I see your ID for this purchase?

**Customer**- Why do you NEED to see it?

**Me**- I just need to verify that you are the account holder, I promise it is solely for the security of the account.

**Customer**- Well, it's in my car (swipes her card again)

**Me**- I apologize ma'am, but I will need to see your ID for this purchase (I remove the items from the counter and suspend the transaction)

She leaves in a huff and stops at the door to say something.

**Customer**- I don't understand why you have to see my ID, you are not allowed to do this. (walks out to her car)

I start to get a line, so I call for my coworker to come up and help, and the woman returns.  Presumabely seeing that there is someone new at the register, she decides to wait in her line.  About 30 seconds later, it's finally her turn and she even adds $50 in gas to her total.  I reach over to my coworker's register and hit the cancel button after I see her swipe her card. 

**Me**- Again, I apologize, but I WILL have to see your ID for this purchase.

**Customer**- Oh, butt out, I'm dealing with this girl, not you.

**Me**- She is a new hire, and is still in training.  After today she will now know to ask for ID for purchases over $75 and using a credit card.

**Customer**- You can't do that, I work in the banking system, and it's against the law.

**Me**- I assure you ma'am, this is not only corporate policy, but that it is not against the law.  This policy was put into place by our merchant.

**Customer**- I work for Visa, we are a merchant, and our rules supercede yours.

**Me**- Our merchant processes our transactions through Visa, and Mastercard.  Visa has no bearing on our current policies and again, I ask to see your ID.

She finally shows it to my coworker, and that was that.  5 freakin seconds to look at a piece of plastic, and she was on her way.  I know what it's like to be inconvenienced, but damn, grow up.

TL;DR - Customer argues about a policy at my store, creates a little scene.

**EDIT**

I seem to have struck a nerve with some people here regarding the legality of such a request on my part.  As it stands, yes, I was doing what I was told.  However, I did shoot an email over to our director of loss prevention, the same person that set this policy in place over 2 years ago, asking about this very same thing.  I will update on Monday when that person is back in the office and sends me a reply.  

I did look over the Visa Merchant Agreement, and it does say that they don't have any problem with me asking for ID, just that it shouldn't be a regular routine.  Maybe it's ok if we only do it when the purchase is over a certain amount?  I don't know.  If the card is unsigned, which most cards ARE unsigned from what I see, then it is actually required to ask for ID.

CheekyJack,88,,197,1ksxsp,,787,"This was a while back when I used to work at a horrible little pub chain in a horrible little town in the UK. We used to have our share of horrific alcoholics teenagers and general dicks who blend into obscurity  so it takes a lot to make a story rememberable.

On this day I was working the bar - it was pretty sweet during the days we had a bit of a laugh and played some stupid games with each other before generally after work drinking and dancing in the scabbiest club in the world then wash, rinse, and repeat

An old man came in and sat down at a table by himself and came up and ordered a drink and a spaghetti bolognaise - not unusual lots of men came in for a pint and food whilst their wives / daughters shopped in the local shopping centre.

He drank half of his pint and his freshly microwaved food arrived and then he walked up to the bar and asked if we had a phone, I pointed him towards it and he ambled over ( probably calling his wife daughter to see how they are doing I thought ) 

He came back pretty quickly and said 'your phone isn't working' I replied 'I'm sorry about that I'll report it, there are some other pay phones across the street'

The man literally went pink and screamed **'what sort of fucking place is this you fuck wit why doesn't your phone work I need to make a call.'**

I tried to calm him down but he ran back to his table picked up a handful of his hardly eaten spaghetti and threw it in my face and chest and at the same time splattering most of the back wall of the pub

I'm a semi-calm man but I work out and wasn't going to stand for someone throwing there microwaved spaghetti in my face, I walked round the bar towards the guy seething.

The guy shouted **'I'll stab you'** and picked up his knife - apart from it wasn't his knife he was eating spaghetti so I'd given him a fork and a spoon - and out of the two he'd chosen badly, he was threatening me with his spoon!

I looked at it still unable to comprehend what was happening and he after a while looked down, saw it was a spoon and then ran out of the pub.

I went upstairs to tell my manager what had just happened, still dripping with sauce after getting cleaned up I still had hours of my shift left - and months later when we were cleaning the high up displays of the bar we still found pieces of pasta all over it

TheBauhausCure,191,,169,1kmwgg,,784,"I'm currently working at a big box store, waiting for an opportunity for my degree to come along. Part of the time I work in our little snack area, where I serve pretzels, popcorn, cookies, and sodas. One of our most popular items is the ICEE...so of course it's the machine that is most often broken.

So of course when I opened today, I found that the ICEE machine wasn't frozen. I sighed, put the broken sign on it...a nice, BIG, clear as day sign, and went to open the rest of the snack area.

Throughout the day I'd get people ordering ICEEs, and I'd have to explain that the machine was broken. I received a variety of responses, from frustration to understanding, but the worst was this one mother who makes you question what the new generation of entitled brats is going to grow up like.

Around noon, this woman comes bumbling up to my register, her little boy, who was probably eight or nine, sitting on his knees in her shopping cart.

Before I had a chance to greet her, she already started her order.

""I'll have a cinnamon pretzel, a bag of popcorn, oh but can you break one order into two separate bags, a hot dog and a large ICEE.""

I quickly entered her order, gave her a weak smile, and said ""Sorry, the ICEE machine is broken.""

The woman's eyebrows raised. She glanced over at the machine, and the large sign hanging on it.

""Uh, I see it right there, churning. It doesn't look broke.""

""It is, ma'am, the liquid isn't freezing.""

""Can't you just fix it, then? I only came here for my sons ICEE, otherwise I would have gone to *other store*!""

I started pulling on my gloves to make her food items. ""I'm real sorry ma'am, I don't have anything to do with fixing the machine. Would you like a large soda instead?""

Of course it was time for her to get indignant. ""Oh *fine*."" She then turned to her son ""*sons name* we're going to get a large soda since someone can't seem to fix the machine.""

This boy, who had to be in fourth or fifth grade, put on some serious crocodile tears. 

""Ca...can't you fix it? I want an ICEE! Why can't you fix it?"" He moaned, grabbing the side of the cart and shaking it.

I thought for a moment he might've been developmentally disabled, but that thought was quickly eradicated by:

""I'm so sorry honey, she can't fix it, she isn't SMART like you. You can't get good help for the money they pay."" The mother then slid her credit card, I handed her a large drink cup, and I went to work on her order.

While I had my back turned, making her pretzel, I heard the boy say he was going to see if the machine was really broken. I assumed he was getting out of the cart to read the sign until I heard a loud sputtering noise.

I quickly turned around to see red ICEE liquid EVERYWHERE, including all over the boys white shirt. 

Oh boy, I knew this was going to be MY fault. 

Just as I finished their order the mother came stomping over to me. 

""Look at the mess your machine made! I want a refund! I have to buy him a new shirt!""

""I'm sorry ma'am, I clearly told you that the machine was broken. Here's your food!"" I set everything on the counter and walked back over to the oven to occupy myself before having to clean up the mess. 

This woman proceeded to take one of the half-bags of popcorn an dump it all over the front of my register before storming off with her now-sticky son. 

She came back fifteen minutes later to buy more popcorn.

I decide to be painfully polite and reply with, ""Well, some people get cigarettes or lottery tickets too, ma'am."" She seems surprised, ""Oh. Well I don't want that.""

Yeah_Jordy,189,,218,1py1fk,,779,"**Background**: I used to work at a discount store, and since there was only a handful of workers, we were jack of all trades; I packed shelves, helped customers, worked the register, everything (including changing lights while they were on because my manager assured me it was perfectly safe).

**Story**: Anyway the night in particular that this story unfolded my manager decided to buy myself and the other worker a thickshake while she went and changed some money. So here I am with my thickshake, packing those personalised number plates onto a rack when I see a customer at the register waiting to be served, so I dash over and begin serving. Now I feel it’s worth mentioning that this store is pretty close to a “junky” area and so we get our fair share of painful customers. This night was no exception.

I went back to packing plates and after a while I realised my thickshake was missing. My manager promptly points out that this tattooed man with a rat’s tail and filthy clothes (sorry for judgemental imagery, I’m still slightly bitter) was slurping on my shake. I confronted him, not quite sure what to say and he got immensely defensive, eventually offering it back to me! I just shook it off and kept working.

Half an hour or so later my manager yells out that someone is in our storeroom (she was behind the counter and had seen it on the CCTV; our storeroom is at the far corner of the store and clearly has an ‘EMPLOYEES ONLY’ plaque on it). I sprinted up towards the back and sure enough as I approached this woman (the kind you can confidently assume to be an addict) is walking out of the storeroom and I see her drop something into her bag. I confront her and she avoids eye contact and tries to busy herself with the nearby shelf.


*Me: What were you doing in there? What is in your bag?*

*Woman: There’s nothing in my bag, I’m just looking.*

*Me: I saw you drop something in your bag, show me what it was.*

*Woman: I ain’t done nothing!*


We went back and forth arguing for a while and I was getting frustrated so I left her and ran back to the storeroom, saw my backpack had been unzipped and sure enough, my iPod was missing. I ran back to the woman who had met up with the shake thief from earlier and handed him my iPod subtly. I saw it in his hands and practically yelled “That’s not yours! Why did you take this?!” as I snatched it back and he yelled in return “I didn’t do nothing!”

The next part is a bit blurry from the adrenaline I was experiencing, but essentially the two junkies refused to explain anything to me. Next thing I knew, a lady pulled me aside and was asking me all these questions and I noticed another 3 were talking to the pair of thieves. This lady told me that she and her 3 friends were plain-clothed policemen/women who just happened to be walking by the shop as my manager screamed out about the woman in the storeroom since there had been reports of thieves in the shopping centre recently. She asked me a bunch of questions and after half an hour or so I got back to work as they kept interrogating the thieves.

As I was working, a male policeman (MP) came up and this is the conversation that unfolded:

*MP: Hey mate, how old are you?*

*Me: 17, I turn 18 in a few weeks.*

*MP: *laughs** *Hah, I thought so!*

*Me: What’s so funny?*

*MP: Well this woman finally admitted to stealing your iPod, but she claims that she only did it to get back at you for hitting on her in the club the other night (In Australia you have to be 18 to go clubbing), I knew she was lying…But you wouldn’t go there would you?*

*Me: (thinking that he meant going clubbing) No I wouldn’t, clubs definitely don’t seem like somewhere I’d like to be at all, even when I am 18.*

*MP: No, I meant her.*


We both had a good laugh about that remark and it made me feel a bit better. The police took down my details and then they escorted the junkies out and gave them a lifetime ban from the shop.

I’d like to say that was the end of it, but 10 minutes later the junky woman returns and just says “I know I’m banned, but when I was out the back I left my phone out there, can I just go get it please? Oh! It looks just like that one!” *she points to my manager’s phone sitting near the register* We politely tell her to get lost and never come back. The nerve of some people!

Since then I’ve had to give an official police statement but haven’t heard much else past that, although I know she got charged.

Before I begin, I need to say that people have tried to guess the location of my station in the comments section of my previous stories.  Please don't.  It's against the sidebar rules and I'd like to maintain a little bit of anonymity.  If you think you've figured out which station it is, just smile to yourself and feel good about your detective work, Lou.

*Today, on a very special episode of* ***Gas Station Adventures...***

My previous stories have all involved law enforcement.  This one, thankfully, does not.  It involves a nice summer day, a father with his young son out for a walk, and years of Boy Scout training being put to good use.

I had only been working at the station for about 6-7 months, and spring was getting ready to move out so that summer could move in, turn up the heat, and eat ice cream sandwiches on the couch while watching re-runs of Ren and Stimpy.  As I stood my vigil behind the cash register, a small fan blowing still-warm air across my face, a man came rushing into the store carrying a small boy.  The man's face was that of near-panic; eyes wide, pale, muscles taught.  His voice shook as he quickly explained to me that, as he and his son were out walking, they ran into a bee's nest.  The boy had been stung, something that he had not experienced before, and had very quickly started to show the signs of an allergic reaction.  Could I please call 911?

Sir, you just walked into the right store.

I vaulted the counter and checked on the little boy.  Yep, he was in trouble.  His face and neck were swollen, he was wheezing badly and obviously having trouble breathing, he was covered in hives, and his heart rate was insanely fast.  He whimpered in that pathetic manner that a young child will when they are very scared.  Damn.  I opened the door, and yelled for Alan (name changed) to run over.

Me:  ""Alan, do you have your cell phone?""

Alan:  ""Uh, yeah, why?""

Me:  ""Good.  Listen closely.  Run up to the fire station, and knock on the door.  Tell them they have a male child suffering from bad anaphylaxis due to a possible bee sting here at the station, and they need to get down here right away.  If you cannot get a hold of someone at the door, or the engines are gone, call 911, and tell them the same thing, then bust your ass back down here.  Now, repeat that back to me.""

Alan:  ""Run to the fire station, boy, anaphylaxis, bee sting, call 911 if no one is there.""

Me:  ""Good.  Now, RUN!""

And off he went, doing his level best to make Usain Bolt look like an asthmatic sloth with some heavy shopping.

*But Osiris32, why didn't you call 911 right then?  Isn't that what you are supposed to do in those kind of medical emergencies?*

A very good question, Timmy.  And, normally, that is exactly what I would have done.  However, in a situation like that, time is your enemy.  Had I called 911, it would have taken a minute or two to get on the line with the dispatcher, relay them the information, and have the dispatcher call out the emergency.  Two, three, maybe even four minutes before the firefighters start rolling.  However, in this case, the fire station is quite literally 125 yards away.  Alan could run there in under 30 seconds and talk to the firefighters directly, shaving off a ton of time.  And since I hadn't heard the fire trucks leave at all that day, I was pretty certain they were still there.

As Alan was doing his Jesse Owen impression, I ran out to my car and grabbed my first aid kit.  My lovely, hand-assembled, nearly-$1000-investment first aid kit.  In it were the finest medical tools money (and a civilian) could buy.  Blood pressure cuff.  Pulse oximeter.  Stethoscope.  Medications.  Hell, it even had a suture kit.  (It got stolen out of my car two years ago, and I'm still pissed about it).  I got to work monitoring the kid's vitals, while writing down everything I could from the father, who was in tears.  Within seconds, I heard the wail of a siren.  Proper help was on the way.

Moments later, several burly firefighters came through the door in that very business-like manner that firefighters have when they are facing a serious situation.  I got out of their way, and started relaying information to the supervisor.  They pumped the kid full of epinephrine, got him on an oxygen mask, loaded him onto a gurney, and rushed him out to the rescue truck.  Total time elapsed from the moment the father walked through the door to being in the truck, maybe 4 minutes.

I went outside and lit up a cigarette.  My hands shook.  I hadn't had to perform any sort of emergency medicine like that in years.  Kind of amazing how all that stuff I learned in Boy Scouts instantly came back to mind, even though I had been out of the program for almost 10 years.  I kept thinking about that little boy, hoping that he would be alright.

I had the next three days off, during which time I was busy with school and a girlfriend.  But upon my return, the father was there with the boy.  The father thanked me profusely, first by giving me a big hug.  He offered to reward me for what I had done, which I of course turned down.  I explained that, as an Eagle Scout, it was my duty and pleasure to help other people at all times.  Seeing the little boy happy and healthy was more than enough reward.  The boy himself was a bit shy, but still said thank you.  I smiled all day long.

Basically, if it doesn’t work, bring it back and I’ll refund your money or give you something better. What I really need is a “It’s not a dud, you’re just an idiot” guarantee. 

Mortars are one of my favorite types of fireworks. Basically, you place the provided tube on a flat level surface, you load the ball or canister shell into the tube, you light the fuse, you run like hell. The fuse lights an ignition charge, which sends the shell up into the air. The fuse then lights the shell charge, which explodes with different effects or colors. 

Mortar shells have to be loaded into the tube with the lift charge on the bottom. Most of the mortar shells I sell have “TOP” and “BOTTOM” stickers on the shell. The mortar shells themselves are manufactured so that if they are put into the tube upside down, the fuse won’t be long enough to stick out of the tube. The instructions on how to load and light the mortars are included with every box of mortars I sell. It’s often printed on the box AND on paper instructions inside the box.   Sounds pretty simple, right?

Here are a few of my favorite “It’s a Dud” returns for mortars so far. 

**”It’s defective!”**  - The guy lit the mortars first, and then dropped them into the tube.  He missed the tube, and the mortar exploded on the ground. That made it “defective”.

**“They didn’t fly up into the air before they exploded!”**  -  It turns out he was lighting the shells in the middle of the street with no tube.

**”I’m too drunk to light these!”**  -  Now here’s a guy you can be proud of. He actually realizes that he’s too loaded to light these safely, so he wants to exchange them for something else. I happily exchanged the mortars for some finale cakes, which are much easier to use. My pride was short lived after I watched him climb into his car to drive away after we made the exchange.

**”I’m afraid that I’m going to hit a plane!**  - We asked. He’s nowhere near an airport. He just thought that they flew so high, they might accidentally hit a plane if one flew by.

**They’re blowing up in the tube!”**  -  Ok, this rarely happens, but it can. His pack had come with two tubes, and both were destroyed when he tried to fire off a mortar. I assumed the shells had gotten wet. While I was swapping out his package of mortars for a new one, he also complained that the fuses weren’t long enough, and that he’d had to stick his lighter into the tube to light the damn fuse. When I showed him how that could only happen if he put the shell in upside down, he got mad at me and told me off. Sadly, the upside down shell thing happens so often that we now keep a collection of exploded tubes on the counter.

**“They blew my tube apart!”**  - The guy decided he wanted a better show, so he had actually loaded three shells into the tube at once and lit them.

**“These things are dangerous! It scares me every time I light one!”**  - Once again, a guy was lighting the mortars first, and then dropping the lit mortar into the tube. He fired off a few, and then returned the rest because he thought it was too dangerous. When I showed him the instructions printed on the box, he yelled at me because, “How the hell am I supposed to read that in the dark?”

Maybe they should watch fireworks on TV next year.

The woman says can we have some extra salsa (not uncommon) 'sure ma'am, no problem' I come back with their drinks and more salsa and she had spit her salsa into her napkin and is dry heaving. I quickly handed her her water and asked what was wrong. Her husband(/bf?) looks at me and says she is hates tomatoes..I'm still confused at this point. She proceeds to rip me a new asshole because it's not that she doesn't like them SHE IS ALLERGIC! And she can taste the tomatoes in the salsa. -_- Her husband assured me as she went to the bathroom to vomit 'the poison' up that she was not allergic. Thru the remainder of the service I was apologetic and waited on them hand and foot aaand she was still a bitch. Every time I brought something to the table she would cut her eyes and ask if I put tomatoes in it. When it came time for the bill, they left me 2 cents and wrote on a napkin 'make sure you tell people there are tomatoes in the salsa!!!' She complained on the way out and said I tried to poison her.

WarriorsDawn,154,,125,14f9de,,780,"Back when I worked at the movie theatre, I was, one day cleaning up one of the condiment stands, refilling the straws, doing whatever. A couple (25-28 I would guess.) comes over, the girl seems nice enough, the guy is decked head to heel in Ed Hardy clothing, so I instantly assume he's a douche.

I give them a friendly smile as they set their stuff down to grab straws and napkins. The girl smiles back, but the guy ignores my presence. One of the other guys walks by, doing a lobby sweep. She steps away from the counter first, and almost walks into the broom. She says ""Oops, sorry"", as she steps out of his way. 

""Don't talk to them. They work here."" The guy says. Taken rather aback, I do a double take at him, my expression pure shock. ""Don't be an asshole."" She responds. ""Don't talk to them. They work *here*."" Flabbergasted, I kinda just stare at him my mouth open for a moment.

They approach the podium to get their tickets ripped, but there's a line, so one of the managers is helping out. They end up going to him. 

""Theatre Nine. First doors on your right. Enjoy your show."" says the manager. ""Thank you!"" She says as they walk past him. ""How many fuckin' times do I have to tell you?! Don't talk to them! They work here!"" 

My manager stops them. ""Excuse me. What did you just say?"" 

""He's just being an asshole."" 

""Yeah. He can also go up to the box office and get a refund.""

""What?! I *paid* money for this movie!"" 

""Yeah, and then you started being disrespectful to myself and my staff. And we don't tolerate that. So you can either go there peacefully or, we can have security escort you over there.""

""Fuck you, man. I'm seeing my movie."" He walks away from the manager towards the auditorium. 

I get called over and asked to call security on my walkie (manager didn't have one at the time.) and follow them in to see where they sit. After a moment or two, security comes through the doors and walks over to me. We go up the stairs, walk in front of them and tell him to leave. 

""Fuck you. If you don't leave me alone, I'll call the police on you for harassment.""

""Actually, since you were told to leave, and did not follow through on that, you'd be the one who gets charged for trespassing. So my friend here is going to escort you to where you'll get your refund and you're going to leave the premises. Or we can call the police, have you charged with trespassing and possibly arrested. Your choice."" I said.

""This is bullshit. What if I just apologize?""

""It's appreciated, but empty and meaningless. Think of this as a lesson in manners."" I say, my smile never leaving my face.

They stand up and begin to walk out. I stop the woman and say to her, ""We're actually only kicking him out. You're free to stay if you want."" She considers this for a moment and smiles apologetically to me. ""I hate seeing movies by myself.""","""No, don't talk to them... They work here.""",905,talesFromRetail
bb_or_not_bb,72,,178,1j4xzk,,777,"In my ten years at my current retail job, I thought I had seen it all. I thought I had heard every lie, endured every sob story, shouldered through every curse word hurdled at me. I've bitten my tongue, restrained snarky replies (to a limit), and pushed down every ounce of fight in me. I used to be happy. I used to trust people. 

But then I worked in retail.

I've seen the cops called on my employers because they would not honor a return without a receipt or any proof that the product is even from us. I've listened as one man went on a screaming tirade about how he was going to hand out balloons that said how much our business sucked because we wouldn't let him use a coupon that expired a year ago. I thought I saw everything.

But then yesterday happened.

Yesterday I caught a woman trying to steal.

Now theft is an issue at my store, a nursery/garden center. Inventory goes missing in people's pockets, their purses, underneath their massive bags of topsoil. There was even one lady who made the owner load her car with stolen goods. He thought he was helping her and he never asked for a receipt. When he came in to yell at me for not stickering her items as sold, I informed him that I never rang her up. 

Needless to say, my boss broke several world records sprinting back to the parking lot and was almost run down by the woman. She stopped. I guess she didn't want to add vehicular manslaughter to her shoplifting charges.

But this was a first for me. Sure I've found the occasional ""forgotten item"" tucked in the corner of a cart, but this time was new.

Due to the main greenhouse being hotter than a Ghost pepper in the summer, the main registers have been closed down for two weeks, and my cashiers and I have being enjoying a slightly cooler location. More like a Caribbean Red Hot pepper. These side registers open to our parking lot and are hardly manned in the summer/winter when there is only one cashier on. Because, regrettably, my boss has yet to find a way to clone me so I can work two registers.

I was working on some managerial stuff and online dress shopping, when a woman in bright blue pants caught my eye. Mainly because the blue was so blinding that when I closed my eyes it remained burned on my retinas. I watched as she approached the open register (where the other cashier was ringing up a sale) and then continue on past it right for our exit.

No ""Thank you for your patronage"" sticker hung from the expensive hanging basket she had in her cart. The other cashier shook her head ""no"" when I inquired if she had rung her up. So I hopped from my post, plastered on my best ""bitch it is on"" smile and approached her.

Me: Hi M'am, sorry to bother you before you leave, but can I check your receipt?

Her: Oh! (starts rummaging in purse) You know...I...I was just thinking....I think the cashier inside didn't give me the receipt. I thought receipts were optional anyway!

Me: Inside? I'm sorry m’am; we don't have a register open inside today. And a receipt should print out every time payment is tendered.

Her: But...there's...well...ummmm....there's a man! Inside by the desk! I saw him.

Me: Do you mean (employee's name)? He's not a cashier; he's at the garden supplies desk. Did he take money from you m'am? Because he shouldn't have.

Her: Yes!! He took my money. I assumed he was a cashier. He said he was.

Me: I can't believe he would do that. He is my brother (true story). Let's go inside and talk to him to get your money back.

Her: No he didn't!! I mean, he told me I could put this in my car and then shop more. I don't have enough room in my cart to shop more.

Me: I’m sorry m'am. I can't let anything leave the premises without being paid for.

I escorted her to the line and stood by her side smiling until she made it up to the cashier (about a two minute wait). She was sweating uncontrollably but I chalked it up to the heat. The other cashier rang her up and gave her the total. Ms. Blue Pants opens her purse and all of the sudden ""Oh no I left my wallet in the car, let me go get it!"" She tried to take the plant with her but I stopped her ""We'll hold it right here until you get back.""

She never came back.

But she did make her husband call and complain that we harassed her and accused her of being a thief.
The owner told him that they had security footage of her leaving the store with unpaid products. He got all flustered and said the boss that maybe she forgot to go to the register. The boss told him next time we won't forget to call the cops.

JellyTip,43,,156,1gkock,,777,"I used to work for a multinational ""fast fashion"" female retail store, I have far too many bad stories to tell, I like to focus on the good. 

My favourite customer ever was a middle aged man, who came into our busy street front shop holding his hat, flicking through random things. I could tell he was shopping for himself, so I treated him like everyone else, positive tone, asking him questions, putting together outfits. Over half an hour he gradually loosened up, started laughing and smiling, his personality came out. We had an awesome tryout session, he kept saying it all looked bad without his hair and makeup. I just said he will have to come back with it to see. 

The next day he walks in in heels, stockings, knee length denim skirt &amp;amp; blouse, with full makeup and wig. Looked like a knockout. He scurried in then smiled! An amazing smile, made his way over to me and we picked up where we left off the day before.

Essemoar,49,,149,1esgpa,,778,"A little background to this story:
I work as a Salesperson in a major UK electronics retailer, based in Ireland. We're perceived as being the bargain store of the group that we're in, so we get a lot of customers in buying the cheapest electronics they can, trying to get bigger discounts and generally kicking up a fuss over €5 or €10 here or there.

One Saturday, when the store is super busy, a Middle-Aged guy comes in. He tells me he's in a rush, but he wants to buy a Home Entertainment system. He keeps me busy for about half an hour, asking stupid questions, before deciding to go for the cheapest model; a display model that has €90 off.

Normally the problem with display models is that they've been used, but these Home Entertainment systems only sit on the shelf, so they're like new, just without the box. I tell him as much, and he starts to get angry, insisting that I give him another €20 off, which I refused to do, because we'd lose money on it. To placate him, I said I'd wrap it all up in bubble-wrap, and get all the accessories for him (normally, we don't bother, because they're all just thrown in a box in the warehouse).

So I go out the back, and get everything together as quick as possible, so I can get rid of this guy.

When I come back out with everything, he's giving out to my manager, saying that I'm wasting his time, and that he should get a discount for his trouble. Manager is having none of it, and says that the best he can do is offer him a reduced price on insurance/warranty, to which he very rudely declines, saying; ""I'm not planning on f***ing breaking it"". Manager tells him there's nothing else he can do, but it's a very good deal, so customer says he'll take it anyway. The whole conversation took about 10 minutes.
So I bring him up to the customer service counter to skip the crazy queues, and bag his bubble wrapped Home Entertainment system, and he pays. He insists that I bring out his purchases, even though he can see we're now very busy, and I'm needed. I'm still trying to be helpful, just to get rid of him, so I oblige.

""Are you parked far, Sir?""
""No, I'm parked right in front of the store""

I'm kind of surprised, since the car park is crazy today, and the only non-disabled spot out front is usually taken by my co-worker, but I brush it off. I carry out the goods to his car....

And he sees the wheel of his car has been clamped.
With a €90 fine to remove it.

I put down his bags, and he turns to me;

""I don't have a phone with me today, can you call this number for me?""
to which I reply;
""Sorry Sir, I'm in a rush"" and run back into the store.","Hustler customer tries to save time and money, loses both.",927,talesFromRetail
PhishnChips,142,,258,1c3jsm,,775,"This tale comes from my server/bartending days not the pharmacy. As you can tell from some of my other stories, I don't take shit. It's probably due to the fact that at this point I was a veteran and just didn't have time for your stupid customer BS. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. 

Now on to the tale: 

I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says ""hello, nice to meet you"" quite as eloquently as ""I'll have a diet, she'll have a diet, and he wants an iced tea"". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. 

When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, ""This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two"" 

In my head I said, ""I""m not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar""

What I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, ""Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave."" And before he could respond I added ""Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?"" 

I could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly (that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit) gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. 

At the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20%.

offbeathamster,206,,214,1oshit,,777,"I Work weekends on the information desk in a large shopping centre, and during my time there I have met all sorts of odd people, but this guy has to be the worst.


He lost his 10 or 11 year old son in the centre at a peak time on Saturday, no sweat, just look for the kid and if all else fails get us to send out an announcement, or at least check his kid wasn’t at the desk, right? Wrong. This fucknut waits a full 15 minutes for the kid to find him before deciding fuck this, and going home.
The kid had more common sense, he found his way to us at the desk and we attempted to find the father, no luck. After 45 minutes of security searching we were unable to find or contact the father and were ready to call the police.


Then, the father rings us and tells us “I’d like to report a lost child, lost about an hour ago.” He doesn’t sound worried, or even interested. This is clearly just an inconvenience to him. But we match up the descriptions and ask him to pick up his offspring.



This is where I really lost faith in humanity. The guy tells us, honestly and openly that he will not pick up his lost son because, and I quote: “I’ve got home now and I have started dinner”. He even goes as far as to tell the child to walk back (the journey would take at least an hour and a half, probably more). 
It took five minutes of us threatening to get the police involved for him to finally agree to pick the child up.



EDIT: The boy said he spent 20 mins looking on the different levels for his father, initially he only wanted to go up onto the next floor and back down again. The neighbourhood the boy said they lived it is relatively good,However the thing which is most significant and really annoys me is that it had been raining, it was dark (4-5pm) 

The reason why we did not call the CPS is that we were letting security handle it. They were assessing all the options and were about to call the CPS when the father agreed to pick up the child, but 3-4 guards had a long word with him escorting him to the car park.

Scarlett88,66,,115,10zo1d,,770,"Just started browsing reddit a few weeks ago, thought I'd finally make an account :D So this is my first post here!

Anyway, a few months back I was setting up some metal home decor sculptures on a shelving unit at the end of an aisle. While I was doing this, there was a man in a business suit having a very loud, very 'animated' cell phone conversation. He was pacing back and forth, and waving his free arm around pretty dramatically. From hearing his side of the conversation, it sounded like he had a major business deal fall through.

Just then a mother with a toddler sleeping in his stroller came down the aisle. She was clearly in her 20s at least, and had a wedding ring on. She had to make two attempts to get around the guy, since he was pacing back and forth at the end of the aisle, and didn't even notice that he almost walked right into the stroller. Just as she starts to go by him though, his arm knocks several of these heavy metal sculptures off the shelf, making a huge amount of noise. Two of them land right next to the stroller, waking the toddler up.

Now, the kid had clearly been fast asleep, and being startled awake by a couple large, heavy, metal objects smashing to the ground right next to you can be pretty upsetting. So he starts crying, and the mother stops a couple feet away to try and soothe him. Apparently this annoyed the guy on the phone, since he turns around and almost yells at her, ""If you can't keep your f---ing little brat quiet, you shouldn't have opened your f---ing legs, you little slut. Now shut that f---ing kid up.""

I couldn't believe that he'd actually said that to her, and the mother was cleary shocked as well. She looked on the verge of tears herself, so I took her straight over to the customer service area, where my manager was. I told him what had happened, and he kicked the guy out of the store, and banned him from our store.

We gave the kid a pack of cookies to help cheer him up (with the mom's permission), and gave her a gift card for our store.

You see I work in one of the busiest stores in my company's roster. I work in midtown NYC and work for one of the larger cell carriers here in the US. Most of the business I see are tourists coming in to buy prepaid sims for the few weeks that they are here.

Right about that time, the guy sees the girls and starts walking over to them. I asked again if he needs help and he says ""nope, I'm with those girls"" all confident and shit.

Customer (screaming):  ""TWO-HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIX MY COMPUTER!  YOU F-ing THIEF!  HOW COULD IT COST $200 TO FIX MY F-ING COMPUTER!!!  YOU ARE RIPPING ME OFF!!!!""

catielynnb,45,,199,1qxv44,,767,"I've got a few stories having been in and out of retail for ~6 years. No major gold mines of irritation with managers, at least not from my most recent position, and I dislike (personally) getting into those. 
However, I'm loaded with great customer stories. 

----

My current workplace, we're just generic retail, and deal a lot in pop culture. There are several clothing items and decoration-y things relating to different fandoms, movies, games, etc, but we also carry generic clothing items, sweatshirts, hoodies, pants. This story, is about pants. 

A few nights ago, got a kid (probably 11-12) and his mom in looking at some Doctor Who things, and he's decked out in buttons, keychain Tardis, and a Tardis shirt. I knew this kid and I would be friends, as an avid Whovian, so I walked over and told them about the sales, and asked him who his favorite doctor was. Bam, sales-win. 

Normally I try not to stay with a customer the whole time, because I don't want to be pushy, but this kid kept asking questions, so I kept answering. Ended up getting him in the dressing room to try on a shirt, after about 15 minutes. While we walked back in my tiny store to the one dressing room, his mom noticed the 'Wall of Pants' and exclaimed, 'MYGOODNESS, 26"" WAISTS!?'. She grabbed one, and brought them along with her. 

I love selling denim, it's eaaaaaaaaaasy. 

Ended up, she grabbed a pair of super duper skinny jeans, and the poor kid was like 'I can't, I can't feel my legs.' While I wandered off to find a pair of regular cut, she was telling her son to put his regular pants back on. I came back up, with two different styles and colors. Mom yells into fitting room 'TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF RIGHT NOW!' and I couldn't help but smile, and kind of laugh. 

I try not to have these reactions, often, although sometimes there are several moments during the day I could, and the mom caught me. I thought I was in trouble, based on the look on her face, but instead, she went on to embarrass her son a little more. 'BUT, IF ANY OTHER GIRL EVER TELLS YOU THAT, YOU PULL YOUR PANTS UP RIGHT THEN....'

I had to walk away,... because laughs.

I did end up coming back to them and she bought two pairs of jeans and several shirts, and even complimented me on my customer service. As they left, she stayed back and told me, 'I have to embarrass him as much as I can now. He's getting too old, too fast.' ","When Mom says, 'Take your pants off,' she means it.",966,talesFromRetail
MedeaUnleashed,138,,150,1p4tym,,766,"My girlfriend works as a Barista. 
A family came in and ordered drinks. The patriarch of the family noted my girlfriends rainbow pride bracelet and then demanded that another barista make the drinks. He did not want her to make their drinks. 

As this is the life we lead, she was going to not start a fight in her place of work and let someone else make the drink. The owner of the coffee shop came over and informed the customer that that she was the barista and she was going to make the drinks. If the customer didn't like it then he could go get coffee somewhere else!

The coffee was grudgingly accepted. 

Then comes the best part. My girlfriend went to thank the owner for standing up for her and not letting it stand. The owner was honestly confused - he did not see his gesture as out of the ordinary. No one is allowed to treat his employees like that.

Hesprit,104,,128,1dycgv,,756,"As mentioned before, the store I've been working at is bankrupt and liquidating.  I was hoping to close the store, but, even though there's less than a week left (by my estimates), the chief liquidator told me as I came in for my shift that yesterday would be my last day.

There's a certain freedom that comes when you know it's your last day.  These are the three stories I have to tell:

**1. That's inappropriate**  A jolly lady, a regular who is a couple of years younger than me, came in looking for new bedding.  So I show her what's left of regular stock (nothing that matches anything else) and the stuff that the liquidators brought in (from god knows where).  I tell her that the sheet sets are 250 thread count, but they seem to be a good quality thread.  

""Oh, I don't know,"" she says, ""I don't usually buy less than 400 tc"".

""Thread Count is only half the story though, it's also quality of thread.  Bedsheets are like men, you have to cop a feel before you buy them"".

She starts laughing as the old lady behind me (who I didn't know was there) starts complaining that ""that was inappropriate"".  Jolly gal told the old lady that it WAS appropriate, and she's going to take me home cuz she had such a good laugh.  It was an offer I declined.

The old lady told the chief liquidator what I said and he nodded sagely and declared ""Yes, that's exactly right.""

**2. Thank you, please come again.** Since the bankruptcy sale signs went up we've had 'new' regulars.  These folks are in the store every day or two, they must know the stock better than I do by now.  I figure they're scoping out what they want, hoping the discount increases again, so for the most part, I ignore them.

But this irate shopper, for a week has been complaining to all the staff that there's nothing left in the store worth having.  It's been explained to her at least 12 times that the store is closing and everything is being sold.  Yesterday, she decided to complain to me.

""There is nothing left in this store.  You can't run a store this way.  When are you getting new stuff!?""

I lean in close as if I'm sharing a secret ""We have to get rid of all of this first, then lots of things need to be changed.  It isn't worth coming again until June 1st.  Make sure you come back June 1st.""

""Really?""

""Oh yes, you'll be surprised to see what's here on June 1st""

She continues to wander around then as she's leaving calls out to me ""I'll see you June 1st!"" which meant I had to explain to my co-workers and the chief liquidator what I had done.  They told me I'm an asshole, but I'm their kind of asshole.

**3. You're Fired**  We close at 6.  At five to six we send everyone to the till.  We block the aisles so people can't go to the back of the store and waste our time, but it didn't work with the Hellion family, Granny, Ma, and the two little hellions (about 9 and 7 years old).  This is a family that has been wandering the store for an hour.  The nine year old nearly tipped over an empty shelving unit onto another unit of breakable stuff and Ma doesn't care and gets irate with me when I tell him to stop. 

They are pushing past the polite staff, ignoring the entreaties to go to the front (they avoid me, big, mean looking guy that I am, but they're doing end runs).  So I go to the chief liquidator and tell him he'll need to fire me in just a couple of minutes.  ?? is his response.

It's now 5 after 6 and I go back to ma and grandma hellion and I quietly say ""Ladies, it is five after six and the liquidator doesn't pay overtime.  If you aren't done shopping, come back tomorrow.  If you are done, go and pay for your shit and get out.  If you keep wasting my time, I will go into the back room, grab my vial of holy water, and spray your children until they disappear in an unholy smoke.

They ran to the chief liquidator screeching about how awful I was...he doesn't let them build up steam, he looks at me and says ""You're fired.  Ladies, you need to check out now"".

evilrick,62,,160,1k0tkl,,755,"A little under a month ago, I started working overnight maintenance at a big box store.  The job is easy, basically I'm a janitor that does my job plus whatever other random nonsense management feels the need to assign me.

Now, the rant:

I am grateful to have this job.  I went quite awhile without any gainful employment, and I wash the bathrooms with a smile on my face because I'm grateful to be earning a paycheck.  My complaint isn't (surprisingly) with management, but with other associates, specifically one certain cashier.  We'll call her Jane.

Jane is lazy.  She wanders off from her register and somebody has to hunt her down when she has customers.  She's no-called/no-showed three times, and she's still employed for some reason. 

If something is spilled, no matter how small, she'll call maintenance to the register.  She did this for a spill the size of the palm of my hand.  Management has told her multiple times that I have a list of things I need to complete by 7am, and that if it is a small manageable spill, she's to grab some paper towels and clean it up herself.  I work hard at my job, and I dislike her for being lazy at hers.  I don't mind cleaning up a quick spill for anyone, usually it is part of my job (at least the big spills), but I'm not the Store Slave.  She seems to think otherwise.

/end rant, and on to the sweet, sweet justice. 

There is no first shift maintenance this morning, so I had extra duties to complete before my shift was over.  No problem, I finished everything at 6am like I tend to do and started to help a friend wrap up stocking his aisle.  7am rolls around, and I swipe my name badge and I'm off the clock!

Now, the company I work for has a very strict 'Do not work off the clock' policy.  I follow this policy very closely.  Just as I walk out of the back room after clocking out, I hear Jane's voice over the intercom, ""Maintenance to register 7, Maintenance to register 7.""  I was headed in that direction anyway, but not to clean.  At this point, I was shopping, so I was a customer.  She sees me, and with this really nasty attitude, snaps ""Register 7, maintenance!""  I grinned back and as 'fake nicely' as I could, waved my badge and said ""Off the clock!""

Turns out, because there was no first shift maintenance and no 3rd shift maintenance clocked in, she had to clean up a big, broken jar of jalapeno peppers that had been dropped right next to her register.  I realize that she was clocking out mere minutes after I was, but the fact that she had to clean up the mess sent delicious shivers down my spine.","A mini rant and some sweet, sweet justice.",915,talesFromRetail

Orange Bitch Be Trippin'

It is a steady afternoon in the world of thongs and titty slings, general crowds milling about and I'm not working alone...for once (yay for that social interaction!).Being the occasional casual slacker I find myself walking around touching bras, yes just ""touching"" them, acting like I'm doing important bra inspection shit so I don't actually HAVE to do anything. 

Greeting customers like a pro and got that plastic retail smile on my face; I got this shit down to an ART. Hiding behind a rack scanning the perimeter and I see Orange Bitch (OB) and her mother (Nice Lady Mum/NLM) looking at the push-up bras, time to make that sale and I swoop in like Jesus.

Orange Bitch is about 15-17 (I'm guessing the younger end of the spectrum), 5'6, fake blonde hair (I know it's ""fake"" cause you can see dem brown roots!), white *insert popular brand name here* v-neck, silver necklace with what looks like a cross on it or a T, navy *insert popular brand name here* shorts which are in my humble opinion too short, some damn ugly gladiator sandals and her cell phone glued to her plastic nails. Oh and I forgot she's fucking orange. No she's not fucking an orange. She embodies the colour orange; she IS orange. While her mum is short, plump, rosy cheeked, smiley, in typical mom capris and plain t-shirt.

Anyways, I swoop in like the messiah, put on my sweet buttery retail voice and ask if they need any help. Orange Bitch is giving me the stink eye stating that they don't need help while nice lady mum is explaining that her daughter needs a strapless bra for homecoming. Easy enough right. Ha. I wish. Nice lady mum is assisting me picking out bras for OB while OB herself is looking like either a. She has to fart, b. She just smelt a fart, or c. She just did fart. Nice lady mum and I get a small handful and send her on into the fitting room with varying sizes because Orange Bitch doesn’t know her size and doesn’t want to be measured.

The minutes drag on and nice lady mum has to go meet grandma at the other size of the store so Orange Bitch stays with me while I continue to try to help her. 10 minutes pass and she emerges out of the fitting room so being nice sales girl that I am I ask if it went ok.

OB replies, “Nooooothing fits me. I want to try some more on.”

Fair enough, sometimes I can’t nail down a customer’s expectations the first time….it happens (very rarely but still happens). So I’m walking around with OB while she picks out bras to try on (totally deviating for the strapless bra she actually NEEEEDS but whatever). I’m being polite to the carrot-like humanoid while she waves her phone in numerous directions pointing me where to go like a mule with a carrot, no big deal nice lady mum will be back soon. Out of the wild blue yonder OB see’s THE bra, OHMYGODSHELIKEHASTOHAVEIT, so she makes her first mistake (other than being a general cuntybaws to her mother) she snaps her fingers at me above her head three times while calling, “Bra girl.”

No Way. Keep calm and don’t kill the sloot with your highland rage.

The problem with THE bra is it is on a 5ft mannequin…on a 5ft shelf…above the 5ft racks…on a wall. Being 5’2 I’m like sheeeiiiittttt, I can’t reach that but whatever customer comes first so I tell her I’m going to put the bras we already have selected in her fitting room and while she tries them on I’ll be out here getting this one. Orange Bitch just looks at me like I’m a one legged dolphin, “Ummm no. I WANT to try on THAT bra First.”

All right all right calm your pants.

Not being allowed to have a ladder (some other coworker fell off one a while ago so now no one in lingerie can use ladders) I tried to figure out how to go about this. The mannequins were legless and attached to a wide and heavy metal base on top of the shelf. So I had to slide the mannequin and then brace myself for all it’s weight (those bad boys are heavy….good thing I’m a beast). I’m teetering back and forth like a weeble wobble, while my face rests on the soft microfiber crotch that was hiding the mannequins plastic shame and my childlike hands were clinging onto its arse for dear life. All the while Orange Bitch was telling me that she doesn’t have a lot of time yadda yadda yadda…I drop the mannequin, tear off its arms like some savage beast (they’re magnetic, relax), strip it faster than Jim Levenstein stripped himself in 1999 and toss OB the bra, disgusted at this animalistic act of speed and agility OB retreats into the fitting room.

It takes Orange Bitch about 3.5minutes to reappear, NO WAY has she tried on ALL of those bras, dangling THE bra from her over privileged finger.

“Ummm like… I don’t like it so I’m gonna look some more.” She queefs in a nasally voice.

Sure fine whatever. I ask if she’s done with the previous bras, she says yes, I trot into the fitting room to clean them up. I was not prepared for this.

I go into the first stall on the left (Orange Bitch’s Room) and holy flying fuck monkeys it looks like a lingerie dealership threw up in there whilst pissing a Bombay hooker’s bodyspray. There are about 17-22 bras ON THE FLOOR, orange marks on the light coloured bras, a coffee cup on the ledge, lipgloss smears on the mirror, ANOTHER coffee cup on the floor AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE PERIOD BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. You must be thinking oh it may not have been her, lots of people use the fitting rooms on a daily basis…We check out fitting rooms every 30 minutes (at the very least) to make sure this isn’t an issue. I was on fitting room duty that day, I checked it, and so I bloody well know it was her.

I slouch out of the room with my arms full of countless items, grumbling to myself, and then I see the hand and hear the snap. Awww hell no….

snapsnapsnap

“Bra girl. Braaaa girl. I need this bra.” Orange Bitch chirps pointing to yet ANOTHER 5ft mannequin on a 5ft self above a 5ft rack. You have got to be kidding me.

So I drop everything on my cluttered register and go to assist Orange Bitch. Keep in mind this bitch probably can’t even drive yet and is snapping at me and it is taking all my self-control not to push her down and sit on her ‘til she cries. I wrestle/molest yet another mannequin and hand her the bra and she floats off into fitting room.

FINALLY nice lady mum comes back and asks if we have a bra to buy yet and I politely tell her that I am unsure because Orange Bitch has been trying on more than strapless bras, nice lady mum does not look happy and marches into the fitting room. I wait outside and listen.

“Orange Bitch, I’ve been gone half an hour and you still can’t find a bra???” – NLM

“It’s not myyyyy fault MOOOOOM. That stupid chunky bra girl doesn’t know what she’s doing.” – OB

WUT. You have the nerve to call me stupid when you can’t even contain your own menstrual blood??? And don’t even get me started on the “chunky” accusation. My rage is showing but I keep listening.

“The bra girl knows what she’s doing, she’s helped me before, she told me you were trying on more than strapless bras.” – NLM

“NO she doesn’t MOOOOOM. She practically threw one of those model ladies at me and made me go in a dirty fitting room.” – OB

AWWW HELL NOOOOO….ORANGE BITCH IS ABOUT TO BECOME ORANGE PULP.

“I saw you go in it looked fine. And I doubt anyone could throw those mannequins.” NLM (total GGG)

“It was after youuuuu left that she made the room dirty, goddamn it I don’t want anything anymore I wanna go home.” – OB 

Now I generally don’t care about disrespectful customers but it irks me when a child is rude to a parent especially a lady as nice as nice lady mum, I’ve served nice lady mum before and she’s wonderful and sweet and just awesome, pleasure to chit chat with. Nice lady mum gives into to Orange Bitch and tells her to get dressed and they’ll go home. Leaving Orange Bitch to get dressed nice lady mum wanders down to the towels.

Showtime. I meet Orange Bitch outside the fitting room.

“Did anything work for you ma’am?” I say cheerily.

“No. Nothing in this stupid store fits, I’m going to go to *popular bra store*.” Orange Bitch replies while handing me bras…well she doesn’t hand me then as much as drop them at my feet.

The rage is coming.

“But I’ve been helping you for over an hour now and you didn’t find ANYTHING?” I push, waiting for the right time.

“God I told youuuuu, nothing fits me here.” – Orange Bitch sighs trying to shrug past me.

I keep my footing strong.

“So I cleaned your fitting room and will probably have to again, took down two large and heavy mannequins that need 2 people to lift, waited on you hand and foot and you still didn’t find anything?” I politely stated.

“Well that’s your job. You’re a BRA GIRL. You’re SUPPOSED to wait on people like me so you get paid.” Orange Bitch said snidely while looking me up and down like I had leprosy.

Fuck it. 

“Listen Missy, just cause your mother puts up with your shit doesn’t mean my job is above smacking you in the mouth.” I said, lowering my voice.

Orange Bitch didn’t say anything just stood there with her mouth open looking like a hungry catfish, so I decided to add on a little more.

“Plus who’s my manager going to believe? Me? An employee of over 2 years with good standing? Or a whiney spoiled little girl?”

Orange Bitch spluttered and stuttered while marching off in a huff. Victory was mine.

TL:DR My jimmies get in such a bunch that I physically threaten a customer.

Lightfairy,97,,240,1m6afd,,759,"Did not expect the response that I got from my first post last night! Wow! So here goes with my next weirdo customer of the week! They do seem to breed them crazy around here. Today. Late afternoon. Very quiet day and a gentleman wanders into the shop. About 5'4"" or so and overweight. We'll call him Mr Strange. Comes straight up to my counter to say hello. Now I immediately notice that he is what we term a few sandwiches short of a picnic, or a bit slow if you will. 

Looks over at the counter to his side.

'Oooh, condoms!'

Looks at me and says 'My dick is this big', holding his hands approximately 12 to 14 inches apart, 'what size condoms do I need?'

I try to keep a straight face and reply 'larger fit'. 

He looks at the packets of condoms all neatly lined up and appears puzzled. I come around the counter and take the aforementioned box and hand it to him. He looks it over and then asks if that is ok to to use for a circumcised dick as of course they are bigger than uncircumcised ones. WTF!

I tell him that it really doesn't matter whether one is or is not. That is the appropriate size for the better endowed man. He puts the box back. By this time I am back behind the counter and he looks me up and down and then he notices my earrings. I happened to be wearing some rather large, dangly silver ones today. 

Mr Strange reaches across the counter towards me and exclaims 'I love your earrings!' 

I take a step back. 

Mr Strange 'Don't you like being touched?'

Me 'NO, I do not.'

Mr Strange 'Could you please take your earrings out and show me how you put them back in again?' 

By now I realise this is one of those guys who gets his kicks by chatting inappropriately to women. I get them in the shop quite a bit. I must admit they never worry me and occasionally I will play along just for fun. Sometimes these guys will spend big. I don't mind talk but touching is OUT.

Mr Strange 'Sorry if I am embarrassing you'.

Obviously very aware of what he is doing! 

'Condoms! He says. Ok we are back to that. 

'Now you are married and have children. What ones do you use?' WTF!

'Sorry but what I do or do not use and my personal life is not your business. Now do you want some condoms or not?'

'But you are married aren't you and you must have kids?' He says. 

'Sir, I do not and will not discuss any personal things with you'. 

'Sorry if I am embarrassing you', he says again. 

By this point I had given up any pretense of being fine with the direction this conversation was going. I gave him a 'look'. You know the ones. The 'I am not going there and I wish you would fuck off out of my shop' look. 

He knew it.

Mr Strange 'I am going now. Can I have a hug?' 

'NO!'

'Don't you like to hug?'

'No I don't and it is time for you to leave. Goodbye!'

He left without another word. 

Now I am always polite and I always stay professional, even when pushed. I work in a field where people often want to tell you about their sex lives. I have found people sometimes test you and then spend large amounts of money. As I mentioned in my first post last night I am a mature woman and I have pretty much seen and heard it all but sometimes a girl just has to say 'NO'. Today was one of those times.

AWard4Love,152,,215,1n6bzj,,750,"While working at the bookstore years ago, we kept getting complaints that the ladies room was filthy. 9 times out of 10, it was just toilet paper on the floor because women are filthy slobs. Whenever a customer approaches from the restroom area, we get prepared to have to clean the ladies room.

The area I worked in was right outside the hallway to the restrooms, and I was usually the one who was given the complaints. I got used to it. We had our walkie talkie headsets that we used to communicate through the store, and I always made it a point to have the customer there as I made the ""request"" to the management (they had keys to the cleaning supply closet).

I am working away when this gentleman approaches me. His facial expression was strange, a mix between amusement, horror, disgust, and embarrassment. I ask him if there was anything I could help him with. 

Customer: Uh... your mens room needs to be cleaned.

Now, this was odd, we NEVER got complaints about the mens room. 

Me: Sure, let me alert the management and get somebody on it when they are available.

Customer: I don't think you understand... Let me show you.

Now, as a small female, I was a bit hesitant to be lured to the mens room, but alas, I followed through. The gentleman opened the door, looked to make sure nobody was in there, and invited me to take a look.

I have never seen a more disgusting situation everywhere. Somebody had a major case of explosive diarrhea I have ever seen. There was poop all up the walls (at least 4 feet up), on the floor, and sitting in the corner, ""hidden"" by the toilet, was a pair of completely soiled mens boxers. I gagged at the sight and smell.

KillerKino,60,,147,1dkkt1,,760,"I used to work as a butcher and counter clerk in a small family-run German deli. We made and sold sausages and cold cuts, and a popular item that is in this story is leberkase - essentially a German meatloaf made out of very finely ground meat(think the consistency of bologna). Leberkase is generally ordered either as a big slab to eat on it's own or to make what is essentially a meatloaf sandwich, or sliced thinly for use as lunchmeat.

In my deli, we used outdated and imported shitty slicers with mismatched measurements so I would always show customers how thick I was slicing things with distance between my fingers, and I usually also showed them the first slice to double-check. A customer came in who wanted leberkase and per her request, I sliced it thin after showing the first slice. Everything is normal here.

Cut to two hours later and it's very busy(the holiday season always is for this place). We handle customers as we see them and, as I'm the only available clerk, I offer to help the next customer. He refuses quite rudely. I'll take a moment here to note that there is a lot of racial prejudice in this store towards non-Germans - I'm not saying the German community at large is full of ancient ex-Nazis that don't associate with non-German speakers, but my local one was, so this wasn't totally unexpected behavior. I do inform him that it may be a while before he can expect any help from anyone else due to how busy it was and then he tells me that he wants to talk to my manager about my attitude. Now we've got a problem.

See, the problem isn't with disputing my attitude, or being a racist prick, but with talking with my boss. He owns the store, he's 60 years old, he's bald, and he's taking a nap. He sounds like a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression and, very consistently, holds mild discontent for anything other than his infant grandson and the almighty dollar. I let the customer know that the boss doesn't want to be disturbed and that I'd be happy to resolve the dispute myself but he insists, and then yells in German for the boss(his office is next to the kitchen and he can hear what goes on in the front fairly easily).

The boss bellows for me from his office(SAMMYYYYYYY, as that is how he refers to me). I run to the boss's office and say ""Boss,"" as that is how I refer to him, ""this guy wants to talk to you about my attitude.""

""What why this.""

I shrugged and he got out of his chair. I continued assisting other customers while keeping an eye and ear on the interaction. It was the husband of the thin sliced leberkase lady! Apparently she had asked for the big slab slices(she hadn't), I was rude to her(I wasn't), and I had charged for what she wanted, rather than what she got(literally impossible). The boss pulls me off what I was doing to confirm that none of this was true, and then proceeds to mock the customer in front of the entire store, probably like 12 customers.

""OH JA, TOO THIN, TOO THIN, YOU WANT THIN YOU GET THIN, HE SAYS THIN AND SHOWS THIN AND YOU SAY 'JA, THIN!' AND HE CUTS THIN! TOO THIN, HAHAHAHAHAHA!""

""Well we're never coming back here!""

""OH JA, JA, WE MISS YOU, OH JA. YOU GO, GOODBYE, HAHAHA!""

Then he walked back to his office and shut the door. The customer took his meat and left, embarrassed, and never returned.

FredFltStn,130,,288,1py6ce,,756,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  My staff is mainly comprised of teenagers, with the guys working on the sales floor and the girls working the registers. I'm not trying to be sexist, it's just that some of the cases can weigh up to 160 pounds (massive assortment), and I don't want anyone getting hurt.

We've seen people show up to buy fireworks dressed in more ways than you can imagine. From formal attire, to pajamas, to clothing that’s basically underwear. Then again, we are a fireworks tent in a parking lot, so there's pretty much no dress code. I thought I had seen it all. Nope.

She walked into the tent in an outfit that left **NOTHING** to the imagination. She had on a micro skirt and a skin tight top that was basically see-through. I swear to God, a noticeable hush fell over the tent when this girl and her friend walked through the door, enough so that I actually turned around to see what was going on.

One of the guys came over and gave me the scoop. The girls name was Brittany, and she actually went to school with Josh. Oh yeah, she also happens to be a porn star now, acting under the name Brittany Sexton. You are definitely going to want to Google that name.

I don't want to say that the men in my tent were distracted, but I'm pretty sure I could have yelled fire, and none of them would have moved toward the exits. I'll be honest here, I may have been momentarily distracted myself.

I’m pretty sure there were several guys who would have volunteered to carry her on their back while she shopped, so she wouldn’t get tired. In fact, I think the only thing that prevented them from offering, was that every time she bent over, her micro skirt combined with her lack of underwear provided a preview of her next feature film.

One of my cashiers has a boyfriend that also works for me. She grabbed him off the sales floor and yanked him back to the counter so fast, I was concerned he may have gotten whiplash.

Eventually, she and her friend finished shopping and they were ready to check out. I rang her up myself, but it was just a coincidence that I ran to the counter and gave all of my cashiers a break.

I can't remember if I gave her a discount (I did), but I can guarantee that when I offered to make her a partner and give her half the business, it was just a joke (it wasn't).

I think when she was finished; she had two bags of fireworks. It took five guys to carry them out to her car.

ZeroHourHero,113,,165,1b6p42,,755,"Im a manager at a tea store, and a bit ago we were bought out by a coffee company. Shortly after this both companies decided to find out who had the best customer base by sending out coupons for free cups of tea to both customer bases via email, social media, and mailers.

The coupon's are all the same, and theyre for the same hot cup of the same tea. There has never been a coupon for another type of tea. 

Cue Angry Customer last night. Its been a crazy day my computer went down twice, had our IT department in and out of the store upgrading our scanners, and had already had four people come in just to rant about nothing, as if my job title was ""Psychologist"" and not Team Lead.

Im working on getting paperwork filled out and in comes a guy with a free cup coupon. One of my staff fills a cup for him and then he asks if its caffeinated the following is what happens.

Associate: Yes, its caffeinated.

Angry Guy: I cant have it then, Im allergic to caffeine. Can I have another cup that isnt caffeinated?

Associate: Well the coupon is only for this tea, if I give you a free cup of anything else I could get in trouble.

AG: Let me see your manager!

Me (Since Im within earshot of it all): Im the current manager on duty, how can I help you?

AG: Your sales person is lying to me! She says this coupon is only good for this kind of tea, and thats discriminatory against people allergic to caffeine! The coupon doesnt specify that its for this kind of tea, and thats illegal, Im going to file a report with the BBB, and sue you.

Me: Sir, the only coupon for a free cup that's gone out in the last month is for this specific tea, while I agree that its not fair to people with caffeine sensitivities and allergies, Its beyond my authority to change the coupon. If you'd like I can give you the number for corporate and if they say its ok I'll gladly change it.

AG: FINE! I'll call corporate, and Im going to get you all fired!

~AG Puts phone on speaker, while still in store and calling corporate. He proceeds to threaten corporate with taking his business elsewhere (He's spent nothing in my store in the last 2.5 years I've been there.) Then says if they dont honor the coupon that doesnt exist he'll sue the company and win. Corporate informs him that the only coupon that will be honored is the one for the aforementioned tea. He calls my staff, the person at corporate, and myself liars and hangs up saying they'll hear from his lawyers.~

Me: Alright sir, lets look at your coupon again. 

AG: No! You'll just make up another lie to not help me!

Me: Sir, I'd like to help you out, but first I'd need to see the terms on the coupon. If you're right, you're right and regardless of corporate saying they didnt put out a coupon with no stipulations, Ill get you a cup.

AG: Alright! 

~AG Shows me coupon, it absolutely says its for the exact tea my staff member, corporate, and myself said it was for. I point this out to him.~

AG: Oh... I guess I just didnt read it. Its still stupid. I was looking forward to my free cup of tea. 

Me: Sorry. However, I will say this much, in the future when dealing with sales people niceness works a lot better. If you didn't jump straight to calling my staff liars, and threatening us, I would have probably given you a cup of whatever you like.

AG: So I can have a cup of whatever I want?

Me: Absolutely not. Have a nice day!

AG: I'm never shopping here again!

Me: So pretty much the same as normal?

AG: $%^ YOU!

[deleted],122,,229,17k8b7,,753,"Hello hello, one and all. 

To begin, I worked for a small fast food 50's-themed restaurant. I can't say where due to the intense nature of this story, but we served steaks and shakes. I'll let you dwell on that little riddle.

I'd worked there for 5 months and absolutely hated the job. I'd been at bad jobs before, but this was just a shitty place to be. It paid poorly even for fast food, the work was physically-intense, the business was constantly in the red and there were so many restrictions on what employees could do just for themselves that it really did make my head spin.

My boss was to evil was Jack Nicholson was to crazy- she immortalized it in such a way that I often wondered if she had either a learning disability, or was simply trying her hand at interpretive dancing, but with being a horrible person instead of the ""dancing"" part. It's probably an avant-garde niche...

This woman outright hated me and pulled no punches telling me. When I was happy, she told me to stop being happy. When I was having fun at work (I tried very hard for those moments) she told me that work wasn't the place to have fun. When I tried to befriend her in any regard, she would shoot my offers down with lightning precision using hate and spite for ammunition.

I think it was because I was full of hope- I was young, still a teenager, and had my entire life ahead of me. This restaurant was just a job and nothing more to me. She, on the other hand, was trapped. She'd moved across the country to work here, her husband worked here, her oldest son worked here and she had no real viable options elsewhere because of that nasty attitude she couldn't shake.

I decided to quit when my mother was in the hospital and my boss outright refused to let me leave on my scheduled time because she wanted to hold me later doing busywork. I wanted to visit my mother, but my boss just wasn't having it. So it was at that moment I took a long, hard look at my life and decided that unemployment wouldn't be so bad. I wasn't a stellar employee- again, it was just a job, but I tried to be upbeat when I could and do my job. What more can you ask from a mere human being? Devotion for $6.50/hr?

The next day, we'd been slammed. Customers were not only inundating our lobby, but our drive-thru, and a full moon was in full swing, since every customer had some generic complaint, or had some special request that made a typical order impossible.

One customer came to the window (I was working the drive-thru, you see) and when I'd explained that his coupon had expired, began to swear at me. Oh, he called me the typical names- ""faggot"" for my long hair, and ""kike"" for my necklace (I assume?). It was at that point that I decided I was going home early;

""You wanna talk to my cunt of a boss?""

He just stares at me. I'm not yelling when I speak, but he sees that I'm no longer fucking around- that my job is essentially forfeit and I'm no longer some sales associate that he can belittle- I'm a living, breathing human being who is capable of starting confrontations.

""Y-yeah... Yeah, lemme talk to your manager."" His tone straightened the hell up.

So I get on my headset; ""This guy wants to talk to my cunt of a boss. Amanda (not her real name), can you come talk to this guy?""

Amanda stares daggers at me storms up to the window. Without even asking if she could help the man, she flings open the window and leans out- ""Did you call me a cunt?!""

""He did!"" the man says, now frightened by the situation. My boss looks to me and asks me if I called her a cunt. I'd just been leaning against the counter at that point;

""Me? Yeah, I did.""

""Get out.""

""Well, fuck you, too.""

""And don't come back! Leave your bowtie on the counter!""

I complied. I complied and laughed my way out the door to leave them fending for themselves. A bit of a cold move- I liked a few of my coworkers... Most of them were chain-smoking teens, meth addicts, or my ex-fiancee, but there were a few people I didn't mind working with.

Take the high road, ladies and gents of retail. You can only crawl deeper in the mud for so long until you realize you're in over your head.

Edit: Wow! Top post?! You're all FAR too kind to me! :D

My ending bit about ""Taking the high road"" shouldn't be misconstrued with good manners- I was trying to articulate not cheating yourself out of happiness. Don't stay in a job you hate, under obligations you don't actually have, for reasons you don't understand. I won't bore you with the ""life's too short"" route, but there are better jobs. Better jobs that pay the same, or better, and with better people to work with. It just becomes a matter of distinguishing bad people, and people who might just say something bad when they're stressed.","""You wanna talk to my cunt of a boss?""",982,talesFromRetail

_____________________________

I work in a processing centre for mortgage applications, there's a call centre above my office and we have like 3 buildings in this one location. Anyway, in my office we're not really trained to do ""call centre"" style work, taking shit from customers all day, getting screamed at when things don't go their way, etc. We're just the processing guys, right? We look at all your documents and decide whether or not you can have a mortgage.

So, we do have like 2 phones that take ""external"" calls. I.e. calls from other departments, not from customers. So some fucknut from the actual call centre is getting screamed at by this one dude, so she transfers him straight through to my department.

Enter my colleague, we'll call her McPreggers, you get 1 guess as to why. I'm sat opposite her and can hear this dude on the other end of the phone just fucking UNLOADING into her ear canal (wasn't that sexy sounding, I assure you), until it happens. She starts to weep. No sound, no sniffling, no reaction whatsoever except a constant stream of tears.

Now, I've been in similar situations when training call centre staff and customer facing staff before, generally you have to help people find a way to deal with shit like this on their own and build up their own defenses for it. This is a 24ish year old pregnant girl with no business being screamed at, being screamed at by some asshat.

I get up from my desk, walk around to hers, take the phone away from her and hit the ""hold customer"" button:

""McPreggers, take five, stop worrying about it and come back when you're ready""

She walks off. Now, to Asshat on the phone:

""Good afternoon Sir, my name's The-Average-Gatsby and I'd like to help you resolve your query as efficiently as possible. Before we continue, I'd like to apologise for abruptly putting you on hold like that, but here's why. McPreggers, the girl with whom you were speaking to in a completely unacceptable and childish manner just now, is heavily pregnant, and you have reduced her to tears. What can I help you with today?""

Asshat tightens up right quick. His issue is sorted within 2-3 minutes (wasn't a tough one, just a tough customer) and he's trying to get off the phone again.

""Before you go sir, can I just ask you to hold for one moment please?""

HE ACTUALLY FUCKING STAYS ON THE LINE. I go get McPreggers.

""Hello sir, thanks for holding, I'm just going to pass you back to my colleague to whom you may apologise if you feel it necessary. Thank you and have a lovely afternoon.""

All I hear is McPreggers:

""That's okay, it's ok. I'm fine, thank you. Thank you, have a lovely day.""

internal_pulse,311,,168,14wuki,,750,"So I bumped into an old co-worker last nigh from when I use to work at a movie theater in high school and we got to exchanging funny stories and memories.  Here is one of the Gems.  

We use to have an employee that worked with us who's sole job was to rip tickets.  Her only duty was to sit at the entrance of the hallway, rip the ticket and point in the direction of the corresponding theater while also looking for people sneaking in food and drinks (during her shifts we have found anything from a med pizza hut pizza to a 30 pack of PBR).  This was the only job she could do because she had cerebral palsy and could not stand for extended periods of time.  I get that.  I was glad she was able to do that job for us.  However, she was one of the meanest bitches I have ever known.  Unrelenting bitch.  She prided herself at being an intellectual.  And I admit she was extremely intelligent.  But any chance she could to rub that shit in our faces or tell us what to do she would.  I think most of us honestly felt bad that she had cerebral palsy and took her nonsense with a grain-of-salt.  

This one day we were busy as hell with a bunch of sold out showings of one of the Harry Potter movies and all of us were busting our asses to stay on top of the rush.  During some downtime while the movies were playing we were all cleaning up and chatting.  Another employee was telling us about a date he had gone on with a girl he really liked while cleaning the counters.  The ticket ripping bitch decides to tell this employee that he was doing a shitty job cleaning the counter.  He shrugged it of and continued with his story.  Again she interrupted and said said something like ""you are so stupid you can barely clean a counter.  If I was this girl, I would be a complete idiot to ever go on a second date with you let alone the first.""  

The employee stopped wiping the counter took a deep breath and calmly told the ticket ripper to please not talk to him the rest of the day.  The ticket ripper began to interject but before she could utter a sound the employee cut her off by loudly proclaiming ""[ticket ripper] IF YOU DO NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW I AM GOING TO BEND YOU OVER THAT TICKET HOPPER YOU CALL HOME AND FUCK YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT.  THAT'S RIGHT [ticket ripper] I AM GOING TO HATE FUCK YOU TILL YOUR LEGS START WORKING PROPER."" 

The room fell absolutely silent as everyone waited for the employee to apologize.  Instead he put both middle fingers in the air and mimicked her walk all the way into the back room.

The employee was sent home for the day and written up.  He later ended up becoming the head manager a few years later.

I get asked every now and then if I'm pregnant. This is usually more embarrassing to the person asking than it is to me, but sometimes, a very special person will just refuse to believe that I could possibly look the way I do without a fetus growing inside of me. I've never even had a kid...

I work at a gas station/convenience store/grocery. A regular customer comes in and commences to having me slice half pounds of three different types of meat and two different types of cheese.

supasanic,77,,186,1j3meg,,741,"So I was military, and since getting out, I've been working in pawn shops while I've been in school. 

Now, this one kid, probably around 13-14, comes in fairly often with his cousin and sells stuff. We normally don't accept items through a proxy (someone other than original owner), but I've been dealing with him for a while, and it's whatever. 

We'll call the kid J and his older cousin W. 

So J and W come in, and they want to sell a bike. Cool. I look up our inventory of bikes, to see how much I could put into one. We have a few. A co-worker of mine pulls me aside and tells me that they have sold about 5 bikes in the last couple of weeks. This is an issue. If we buy too many of a similar item from the same person in a certain time frame, Pawn Unit Detectives come and do an audit. Ain't nobody got time for that. 

So I inform J and W that I wouldn't be able to purchase the bike. W says ""That's cool, makes sense, I'll come back some other time"" and gets ready to leave. I don't really suspect any wrong-doing, but it's sketchy. 


W is all about leaving, but J decides he can't have that, and proceeds to challenge me. Now, this kid is about 5'4"", maybe 100 lbs soaking wet. I'm about 6'1"", 245, fairly built, and bearded. I'm no where near tough or intimidating, but I can make people think twice about getting loud. 

J then accuses me of being racist (not the first time, won't be the last...happens a lot in this business) and that I won't buy because I think they stole the bike. I tell him, that I don't think that, and repeat my original explanation. 

He continues to get loud, and over and over tells me this is ""fucking bullshit, you don't want to buy from me because I'm black, and you think I stole this shit"" 

Well I didn't, but I'm starting to. So I tell him I wouldn't buy the bike, and he could leave, or I'd stop letting him sell to me altogether. He didn't like that. He got louder and more obnoxious. There were ~4 other people there waiting, and it was getting embarrassing. 

I asked him to leave. I was very polite about it. W was telling him to calm down and just leave. J was not having it. 

Tells me to fuck off. I say okay, and go get my manager. Now. My store manager is all but 5'2"", about 100 lbs, little skinny lady. Nicest person you will ever meet until she gets pissed. So she comes out into the buy shop, and takes a look at the kid. Asks what the issue is. J starts yelling. 

She looks at him, and tells him that unless he's 18 (legal selling age), he can stop talking, and let the grown ups talk. 

So my manager starts talking to W who is visibly nervous/embarrassed. J is still yelling. Myself and another bigger co-worker escort him out. 

As we're walking out the door, a lady gets out of her car and starts screaming at us. Oh great.

Woman starts yelling at us, wondering why we're rough handling a little kid. I explain the situation, being as vague as possible. W comes out of the store. 

Turns out this lady was W's mother, J's aunt. She looks at them both, and proceeds to ask W what happened. He spares no details. She smacked the hell out of J in the parking lot, and tells him to get in the car. Pretty sure J starts crying at this point. My face hurt.

They get in the car and get ready to drive off. The lady apologizes to us, and tells us she doesn't know where he got that kind of attitude from. She drives off, and we can see her losing her mind just screaming at this kid.

Nice days mean nice cars at the station.  And given the wealth of the neighborhood, ""nice cars"" mean stuff the rest of us only ever see at car shows, race tracks, and while playing Need for Speed.  The car that BDB1 (Bald Douche Bag 1) drove in that day was no exception.  A gloss-black, 630 hp, 6.5L V-12 Lamborghini Murcielago LP 640 Roadster.  A car worth more than most people's houses.  Also something completely unreasonable to own in a residential location with a relatively low highway speed limit.

I definitely noticed the car drive in, because it's impossible NOT to notice the throaty rumble of a Lambo as it idles up into a parking lot.  I watched as one of our attendants goes over, greets the driver, does the usual she-bang to figure out what to get him, etc etc.  But things get a pit odd when the attendant goes to the pump and tries to use the card given to him.  He's obviously having difficulty with something, but he's a bit too far away to see what.  He goes back to the driver, speaks with him for a moment, and then hurriedly backs up as the driver flings open the door and starts storming towards the store.  BDB1 then rants and gesticulates towards the pumps, to which the attendant quickly moves and begins punching in the codes for a pay-after-the-fact.  Great.  Entitlement, thy name is Lambo owner.

Now BDB1 is very easy to describe.  Imagine Mr Clean.  Same bald head, same tight white shirt, same tight white pants, same musculature.  Now, replace his face with that of Christopher Titus.  You are now 99% accurate.  Oh, and have him doing this rather amazing scowl/sneer to get his mood right.

""Your guy out there can't seem to make my card work!"" he loudly states, slamming what looks like a credit card but doesn't sound like plastic down on the counter.  Ah.  The Black Amex.  Yes, one of those rare and mysterious things that are semi-legend in the retail community.  If you are not familiar with the Black Amex, it's a variation of the Platinum American Express card that you are invited to have.  The minimum monthly payment is $2,500 and it's limit, while not actually being infinity, is EXTREMELY high.  They are very rare and only owned by people or businesses with tons of money.  They are also made out of metal and slightly thicker than standard plastic credit cards.

Which is why it wouldn't run out at the pump, because it physically wouldn't fit in the credit card slot.  A delicious bit of irony, I must say.

""No problem sir, it just seems that your card is a bit thicker than most.  Let me run it here for...ummm...well now, it doesn't seem to fit through this one, either.""

It didn't.  I couldn't get it to fit through the slot on our card reader.  BDB1 then snatched the card out of my hand, and tried himself, but it was pretty obvious it wasn't going to fit without a crowbar being handy.  I smiled apologetically.

""Well then, just type the damned numbers in manually!""

""Sir, I'd like to do that, but in order to do so, I have to run an manual imprint of the card."" (*Aside:* I was quite used to doing this, our satellite connection went down all the freakin' time).  ""I can't do that with your card, because the numbers aren't raised, and they won't allow me to just write them down.  I'm terribly sorry, do you have another card you can pay with?""

Cue a long rant about how this card was supposed to be accepted everywhere, he was worth blah blah blah, he's so important, the usual drill which I quickly tuned out.  As he was stroking his ego to near completion, I was continuing to monitor what was going on outside, just in case something more important could offer me an excuse to dismiss this guy, such as someone dropping a piece of paper on the ground.  But what I instead saw was one of the local cops, pulling up to the store.  While I took note of it, it did not fully register in my mind, since nothing illegal was happening, nor did I expect anything illegal to happen.

So the cop walks in while BDB1 is in midbluster, stops, crosses his arms, and leans against the counter as if to say, ""Boy, I've had a boring shift, but here's something entertaining I can watch for a few minutes.""

I recoalesce my attention on BDB1, and again apologize and ask if he has any other way to pay.  He doesn't WANT to pay another way, he doesn't HAVE to, he's a BLACK AMEX HOLDER.  I explain that since I physically can't accept the card due to equipment issues, I'm going to need another form of payment.  At this point, BDB1 opens his mouth and says something that gives me one of the greatest openings in the history of things being open:

""Well what would you do if I just drove off right now?""

I tried, I really tried not to smile.  But it was too much, and the smile I had was quite broad, as I replied, ""Well sir, I wouldn't be able to do a lot.  But the guy behind you might do something about it.""

BDB1 turns around to see the local cop, standing there with a big feral grin on his face, nodding emphatically.  The color on BDB1's face drained away as his ego deflated down to much more tolerable levels.  In stony silence, he produced a different credit card, ran it, signed for it, and stormed out of the station.  As soon as the door closed, the cop and I both started laughing like crazy.  When I could finally speak again, I told the cop, ""You should go pull him over for having a tail light out or something!""  At which point we cracked up all over again.  Never did see BDB1.

Iworktheretail,129,,192,1m5cy0,,739,"I was putting up stock and talking with a co-worker when a customer walked over. We immediately stopped talking so we could help him out.

**Me**: Can I help you?

**Him**: Yes, I checked on your website and it says you carry wooden rocking chairs that can go outside, and currently you have 6 in stock, where are they?""

He looked about 60 and had the look that he thought he knew what he was doing. What he described I hadn't heard of before and I knew our area very well. I glanced over at my co-worker and she looked just as confused as me.

**Me**: We don't carry those over here but maybe in a different area of the store If you walk towards-

**Him**: No they already sent me over here

His tone caught me a little off guard, he sounded sure that I was supposed to know the answer because that was my job, and he need my help. That he knew he was more important than me

**Me**: Well I haven't heard of that chair before but I will show you what we have.

I walked with him over and showed him one section where we had chairs and pointed to a nearby area where we had some others.

**Me**: These are all of the chairs we have.

He is starting to get frustrated because it is obvious I am clueless about what he saw, according to the website, we should have in stock.

He looks at the first area, wasn't there, so he moves on and looks at the second selection of chairs. He comes back over to me. And he sounds like he is starting to have a hard time keeping his cool. My face usually appears fairly blank or unemotional. So I guess it could appear that I didn't care. I knew we have not carried what he was talking since I have been working there which apparently wasn't true according to what he saw on the website.

**Him**: Your website says you have it in stock

**Me**: Are you sure that wasn't just for online?

Many times people go by that it says we have it...but they are looking at the only online section of the website. I figured that would be what happened.

**Him**: No, it says you have it in store. Do you want me to look it up on my phone and show you?""

(exasperated) **Me**: Yes, that sound good.

He gets on his phone, and pulls up the webpage and shows me what he was talking about.

I blinked.

In a tranquil voice **Me**: Sir, that website is for ""Megamart""

**Him**: Yes (Of course it is)

**Me**: This is ""Megacorp""

**Him**: Oh

He looked at me with sudden awareness of how he had been acting to me. He realized my blank expression was not that I was an idiot or clueless. He saw me as a person. He felt he needed to get out of there, away from me, immediately.

**Him**: Do I have to go outside to get to MegaMart?

**Me**: Yes

His whole body is ready to get out of there.

**Him**: Is it just outside the door I came in?

He was gone.

Dcoil1,81,,141,154etw,,745,"Back in High School I worked at Pizza Hut. I had worked there for almost a year as a cook, and though I hated the job, I generally got along well with my coworkers and supervisors.

One day an old middle school friend calls me up to tell me he's coming to visit for the weekend in a couple weeks, and I told him I'd request the weekend off so we could hang out. The next day I put in my request and it's granted, no questions asked.

The night before my friend is supposed to arrive I report to work for my shift and walk into the manager's office to check my schedule as I always do. Immediately, I notice that my two requested days off now have ""12pm-8pm"" hastily scrawled onto them in pencil in the manager's handwriting, who was sitting a few feet away talking to the assistant manager. Before I even had a chance to react, I blurted out ""What the hell!?"" 

The two managers paused their conversation and said ""Something wrong, Dcoil1?"" 

""Uh, yeah, I requested these two days off two weeks ago. Now you've penciled in that I'm working 12-8?""

Store Manager: ""Yeah, So-and-so quit yesterday and we need someone to work that shift.""

Me: ""Well, I'm sorry, but I have a friend coming into town this weekend and we made plans. I don't think I can work this schedu-""

Assistant Manager: ""It's not a question of whether or not you *can* work that shift, Dcoil1. You're GOING to work that shift!""

I was furious. I couldn't even say another word, I just scowled at them and stormed out. I spent the whole night fuming, not saying another word to them and weighing my options and trying to decide if I really needed this job or not. At the end of my shift, I didn't stick around one extra minute. I punched out at exactly the time I was scheduled off.

The next morning I called in, and the Assistant Manager answered. I said ""Hi, this is Dcoil1. I'm not coming in today, because I asked for it off and was approved, and you guys put me back on the schedule without even consulting me or asking whether I can work the shift. I don't appreciate being told I *have* to work a shift. You can fire me if you want, but I'm not working today.""

ASM: ""....fine."" *Click*

I thought surely I was getting canned, but I had a great weekend despite of it with my friend, and when my next shift rolled around, I walked in and punched in like nothing happened, and no one said a word to me. In fact, the ASM didn't say anything to me for a week or two, but she eventually got over it.",My proudest moment of resisting a manager's bullshit,886,talesFromRetail
FredFltStn,226,,336,1q9jql,,736,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Most of my employees are teenagers, and have real jobs during the rest of the year, just like me. Even so, they jump at the chance to work for me, since I pay better, feed them, give them free fireworks, and always try to make my store fun.

Last 4th of July, I had a couple of new guys helping out during setup. One of the news guys dropped a beam while setting up some rack shelving, and it almost hit his foot. He turned to one of the teenagers, Colby, and joked that he would need workers comp.

Colby has worked for me for several years now. Without looking up or stopping his work, Colby perfectly explained our workers comp policy, just as it had been explained to him years before.

“Craig doesn’t have workers comp. If you get seriously hurt, we have to kill you and hide the body”.

**TL;DR:**  **Workers' compensation** is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence. The tradeoff between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as ""the compensation bargain"".

While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment (functioning in this case as a form of life insurance).

General damages for pain and suffering, and punitive damages for employer negligence, are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case. These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania, with the United States following shortly thereafter.

**Statutory compensation** law provides advantages to employees and employers. A schedule is drawn out to state the amount and forms of compensation to which an employee is entitled, if he/she has sustained the stipulated kinds of injuries. Employers can buy insurance against such occurrences. However, the specific form of the statutory compensation scheme may provide detriments. 

Statutes often award a set amount based on the types of injury. These payments are based on the ability of the worker to find employment in a partial capacity: a worker who has lost an arm can still find work as a proportion of a fully able person. This does not account for the difficulty in finding work suiting disability. When employers are required to put injured staff on ""light-duties"" the employer may simply state that no light duty work exists, and sack the worker as unable to fulfill specified duties. 

When new forms of workplace injury are discovered, for instance: stress, repetitive strain injury, silicosis; the law often lags behind actual injury and offers no suitable compensation, forcing the employer and employee back to the courts (although in common-law jurisdictions these are usually one-off instances). 

Finally, caps on the value of disabilities may not reflect the total cost of providing for a disabled worker. The government may legislate the value of total spinal incapacity at far below the amount required to keep a worker in reasonable living conditions for the remainder of his life.

A related issue is that the same physical loss can have a markedly different impact on the earning capacity of individuals in different professions. For instance, the loss of a finger could modestly reduce a banker's professional facilities but ruin a pianist.

In 1855, Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts; 26 other states passed similar acts between 1855 and 1907. These acts simply permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission. (A similar scheme was set forth in Britain's 1880 Act.)

After Germany's 1884 Act, workers' compensation laws began to be reformed to reduce the need for litigation, and to mitigate the requirement that injured workers prove their injuries were their employer's ""fault"". For example, The 1897 British Act replaced the 1880 Act.

In the United States, the first statewide worker's compensation law was passed in Maryland in 1902, and the first law covering federal employees was passed in 1906. By 1949, all states had enacted some kind of workers' compensation regime. Such schemes were originally known as ""workman's compensation,"" but today, most jurisdictions have adopted the term ""workers' compensation"" as a gender-neutral alternative.

At the turn of the 20th century workers’ compensation laws were voluntary for a couple of reasons. Specifically, an elective law made passage easier and many felt that compulsory workers’ compensation laws would violate the 14th amendment due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. Since workers’ compensation mandated benefits without regard to fault or negligence, many felt that compulsory participation would deprive the employer of property without due process. 

The issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in 1917 when in New York Central Railway Co. v. White it was held that an employer’s constitutional rights weren't affected. After the ruling most states enacted new compulsory workers’ compensation laws.

In the United States, most employees who are injured on the job have an absolute right to medical care for any injury, and in many cases, monetary payments to compensate for resulting temporary or permanent disabilities. Most employers are required to subscribe to insurance for workers' compensation, and an employer who does not may have financial penalties imposed. 

If you’ve actually been crazy enough to read through all of this text, you should seriously consider seeking some type of professional help. The entire TL;DR was meant as a joke, and the short story was actually above the TL;DR. I do appreciate your persistance and, to show it, please allow me to bestow gold on the first 5 of you that obviously have nothing better to do than surf reddit, and can follow my instructions. Please add a comment to this story that starts with “Candygram for Mongo!”. Feel free to say whatever else you’d like in the comment, since you seen to have some free time. Of course the first five have long come and gone if you're reading this now, but what the hell.

Texas employers have the unique ability to opt out of a the Workers' Compensation system under the original state law written in 1913. However, those employers, known as nonsubscribers, are exposed to potential liability in the event of an employee injury. 

Though the employee must prove that the employer was negligent in causing his or her injuries, the employer loses its common law defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, and the fellow employee doctrine. If successful, the employee can recover his or her full common law damages, which are far more generous than workers compensation benefits. 

Yeah, this story is about that. Thanks Wikipedia.

ImAMattressSalesman,78,,183,1htliq,,736,"I have been working for a large mattress retailer, managing and selling mattresses for the last 10 years. As you can assume, I have amassed a large number of stories from ridiculous and unbelievably stupid customers but this one is one of my favorites. A customer came in to our store one afternoon and explained that his current box spring was deemed defective and he wanted to exchange it for a new one and buy a new mattress in addition to the exchange. Not a problem, one of my sales associates took care of him and being new to retail sales ended up giving way too big of a discount on the bed, but whatever, the customer is happy. Or so I thought... About two days later I am leaving my shift and headed home to change and take my gf out to a concert for the night when I get a call on my cell phone from a number I don't recognize. I decide to answer it, and Immediately regret this decision as my casual greeting of ""hello"" is met with a barrage of insults and demands of someone who is in a crazy fit of rage. Keep in mind, I am off of work and do not give customers my personal cell phone number so I am extremely confused as to not only what this person is talking about, but also how they were able to get my number. I begin to piece together that this is the customer who had set up a warranty exchange the other day, and he has been berating my sales staff all afternoon and one of them has cracked and given him my number under duress (big big no no, but one problem at a time). Being the customer service professional that I believe myself to be, decide to hear this angry customer out and find out how we have wronged him. By the way he is yelling at me, I'm assuming we have killed his dog or brought some sort of irreversible shame upon his family, but it turns out that the drivers had refused him the exchange we set up a few days ago. After listening to this customers opinions on my management/business skills being shouted at me for a few more minutes I'm able to find out why the drivers had refused his exchange... The customer gave away his defective box spring. There was nothing to exchange for because he got rid of it. He didn't know he had to keep the defective product for the exchange... ""EXCHANGE! Meaning we take the old product and you take the new stuff! That's how an exchange works you fucking dipshit! It's called a fucking exchange!"" Is what I wanted to scream into the phone, but I calmly tried to explain to the customer as if he was a 4 year old, how an exchange works and why the drivers weren't going to give him a new box spring for free. This still didn't make sense to him, and he had become even more angry because ""he owned his own business, and would never treat his customers this way."" Really guy? So if I buy a refrigerator from you, call you up a year later and tell you that it's broken, I can come in and get a new one free of charge without giving you back the old one with no proof of any defect? Yeah. Once I put it in these terms the guy decided to end our call by telling me that he is going to come strangle me. 

He never did, and he never got his exchange. Fuck that guy. 

TL;DR: Customer thinks an exchange is a one sided transaction, and berates my sales staff and I about it. Ends up threatening to kill me because of it.

Phishmcz,56,,154,1nxalv,,733,"This is a fairly long story because the whole situation was ridiculous.
I work in a grocery store bakery where we have Bakery Clerks(that's my job), and Cake Decorators. We take cake orders for kids birthdays, farewell parties and other things like that where people want cakes. This has probably been the best/most frustrating customer experience yet. A woman placed an order for a double layer chocolate cake with white buttercream frosting for her kids 8th birthday for 2pm this past Saturday. The Deco's (cake decorators) usually make it 1-2 hours before it's suppose to be picked up so it's still fresh. This particular customer came in 3 hours early demanding to pick up her cake which hadn't even been made yet. I had about 3 other customers to help when she came in so I said ""I'll be right with you!""

Her-I'm just here to pick up my kids cake!

Me-It'll just be a min, I'm in the middle of placing another order and I have a few other people to help.

Her-I'm in a big hurry!

Me-I'm sorry but you'll just have to wait, my co worker is on her lunch so I'm the only one here right now.

*She mutters something and starts pacing around. I get to the next customer as quick as possible*

Her-I really just need to pick up my cake! I have to be back at the party in 20min!

*I take a deep breath and explain to the customer I'm currently helping that I'll be back in a min. She nods because she obviously understands that this women is a total bitch*

Me-Ok ma'am whats the name on the order?

Her-Stupidannoyingname

*I go into the back of the bakery and check to see if it's ready...It's not. Her order sheet is still sitting on the counter waiting to be made by the Deco who's on lunch*

Me-I'm sorry but your cake isn't ready yet.

Her-What do you mean it's not ready?! I placed the order a week ago! I was told it would be ready today!

Me-Yes but you placed the order to be picked up at 2pm. Its 11.

Her-Well the party starts at 11:30! What am I suppose to do with no cake for my kids birthday?


Me-Ma'am I'm sorry but the decorator is on lunch right now. There is no one to make your cake for another 25min and we have 2 other orders to fill before yours is going to be made. I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do right now. You'll have to come back at 2. *I was honestly doing my best not to flip out on her*

She ended up walking out the door, so I went back to helping the other customers who had been waiting to be helped and had been there before her. I apologize to them about keeping them waiting, and they all kind of smiled and laughed. 10 minutes later, I'm sweeping up a small mess I had made, and had my back turned to the entry-way that leads to the back of the bakery. I see something in the corner of my eye so I turn to see that same women heading into the back of the bakery. So i bolt back there to intercept her.

Me-Ma'am you're not allowed to be back here. Your cake still isn't ready.

Her-Well I really need a cake! Sell me this one! *points to another order for another kids birthday*

Me-That's not your cake. That's for another child's birthday today. I can't sell you that one.

Her-But our kids have the same name! I can just use that cake. I'll pay for it right now!

Me-I'm not selling you that cake! It's for someone else! *by this point I'd had enough of her*

Her-Well what am I suppose to be about my kids birthday?!

Me-I don't know. Maybe next time you can place an order for a cake to be picked up BEFORE the party,and not 3 hours after. Or you can place your order at another store. Either way, your cake is not ready. I'm not selling you someone else's cake. Please leave and come back when your order is ready!

Apparently the service I ""refused"" to give her was unacceptable, so she filed a complaint with my manager, which I guess ended up making her look like an idiot because he asked her not to come back, then told the Deco not to even make her cake. She never came back in, and when I told the Deco what had happened, she laughed and said after that, she wouldn't have made the woman's cake anyway.

TL;DR-Woman demands I sell her a cake for another kids birthday. I politely told her to piss off.

Back in the late 80s, when the Japanime craze was just hitting the states, our shop was the only place in the city to purchase merch. imported directly from Japan.  Manga, videos, magazines, model kits...you name it, the boss was bringing it in.  This was just about the time that ""Robotech"" had hit the airwaves, and we couldn't keep those kits in stock to save our lives. 

So...one day, a mom comes in with a huge Robotech model kit that she had purchased during our Christmas sale...two months prior.  Big sucker, over $100 retail.  

**Mom**: I need to return this model kit.  It's broken. I need my money back.

**AX**: Broken?  I'm sorry to hear that.  I'll need to see your receipt and the model kit. 
(Now, she actually had the receipt.  I opened the box to see what the problem was...)

**AX**: Ma'am, you do realize that over half the kit has already been put together, right? 

**Mom**: That doesn't matter.  The pieces have broken off and I want my money back.  

**AX**: The pieces are supposed to break off.  See, this is called a 'sprue.""  The pieces for the kit are attached to it until they are broken off by the builder to put the kit together. 

**Mom**: No..the model kit is broken.  I want my money back. 
(The entire time, the kid (""Bobby"")who had been building the thing was standing there, just staring at Mom). 

**Bobby**: Mom, you're really embarrassing me...

**Mom**: Shut up! I'm trying to get you some money back so you can build a better kit.  One that won't break!  (to me) Now, are you giving me the money back or not?

**AX**:  I'm sorry, but not only has this kit already been used, but you'll note the sign behind me that says ""No Refunds - Exchanges Only, Within 30 Days.""  I couldn't give you anything for it in any condition. 

**Mom**: (comments of outrage and shock).  We're never coming here again!  
At that point, she scoops up the box, the kid, and storms out. 

...fast forward...1 week later...the kid is back, this time with his dad. 

As you might guess, he also had the kit.  The conversation that ensues creates an atmosphere of deja vu for the employees, who are observing from afar.  Finally...

**Dad**: I don't understand why you won't give me my money back.  This kit is obviously broken.  I just bought it last week! 

**AX**: Actually sir, your wife came in with your son and tried to return this just last week, and I...

**Dad**: Quit Lying!  My wife has never been in this store before in her life.  I'm the only one who ever comes in here! 

**AX**: Sir (I say, pointing to the boy looking at our other model kits) is that your son? 

**Dad**: Yeah, so? 

**AX**: Hey, ""Bobby,"" how's it going? 

**Bobby**: Fine, AX.  (with an ""i'm really sorry"" face)

**AX**: So.....

toxlab,88,,126,1mlshh,,730,"I originally posted this as a reply to /u/FredFltStnin 's post about telling off a jerky customer. Here's a story about a crazy customer from my teenage years:


Only once in my life have I had an opportunity to speak up for a retail wage slave having to put up with some idiot's nonsense. Granted, it was pretty monumental.

I was taking a road trip with some high school buddies and we stopped at a burger joint. As soon as I got through the door I heard yelling. A crazy woman was doing this huge dramatic number about how she had been ripped off and wanted her money back. The fact that her family had eaten a huge tray of food and felt it wasn't up to snuff meant she deserved to get it all free.

The cashier just kept saying, ""The manager will be here in a minute."" While backing away from the counter. Crazy Bitch keeps leaning over and trying to poke the cashier. After a minute or two, one of our party tells her to stop yelling and mind her manners. This does not sit well with Crazy Bitch, and she turns to yell at us. They go back and forth for a few minutes, with her threatening to go get her purse and, ""Put some bullets in ya."" The whole time she's acting up and being a tool, The driver's girlfriend had been in the bathroom. When she returned to find CB poking the driver, she decided to get involved. It bears mention that GF was a Jeet Kun Do student.

She grabbed CB by the shoulder and spun her around. When CB's hands came up, she got a devastating chop to the throat. A graceful leg sweep put her on the floor. GF dropped a knee into her chest, pinning her to the ground.

She's wailing like a banshee. Husband comes running over and starts shucking and jiving about all the damage he's going to do, before becoming aware that he is now surrounded by punk rock teenagers who really, really like to fuck shit up.

After about five minutes of this, the cops show up. They ask GF to get off of CB. When she pops up, she goes off on a diatribe about how we were skinheads looking for minorities to beat up. Every time the cops start to ask a question, she starts yelling. They keep telling her to button her lip, and finally tell her she's going to get cuffed if she can't shut up. Her husband picks up the slack and starts inventing slurs that we threw out.

At this point, I tell the cops that CB claimed to have a gun in her purse, and that said purse was sitting in the dining room, next to the couple's unattended children.

Suddenly CB stops screaming and is ready to leave. They're all going to go right now. She starts hollering at her children, who jump up. She wants out of there NOW.

The cops take this as a good sign that CB is indeed packing heat. The purse is now unattended, and the family is trying to beat feet. One cop holds them up while the other opens the purse. Well whaddaya know. A handgun.

The manager had arrived and was watching this go down. Eventually, we turned from the ongoing spectacle, and proceeded to get our grub on.

It had been a long, hungry day, so we all got a silly amount of food. When I got the total, I went to pay and discovered that the only bill I had that would cover the cost was a hundred. The cashier explained that they didn't take Bens, and we all started going through pockets.

I asked the manager if he could make an exception, as I didn't have enough twenties to pay the fare. He just looked at me for a minute, pulled out his keys, punched some buttons, and zeroed out the check. He said, ""On the house."" and went into the back.

We got our loaded down trays and sat in the dining room. The whole time we were eating, we got to watch CB and hubby being run through the wringer. Had she kept her mouth shut, she may have gotten away. But once the cuffs were on, she ramped up her bullshit until the cops looked like they were going to put her under the jail.

When I unwrapped my burger, we all marveled at the amount of bacon that had been put on. It was comical. All our sandwiches looked like the pictures on the menu rather than the sad reality that they usually are. Even though we were starving, there was just too much food to eat in one sitting. We packed up our leftovers and went back to the counter to say thanks. The cashier looked happy. I looked over to see CB sitting there in cuffs, waiting for someone to get her children before she went to jail, and I waved goodbye.

stargirlsangelle,196,,159,15y11p,,730,"This tale is from my point of view as a customer. I understand sales, really, I do. I've had to do them, no one enjoy them, yada yada. But I work in retail. I know what I want. And I'm a customer. So here I am ready to drop big bucks on a mattress, I do online shopping, investigate the deals, visit the smaller stores like ""Drowsies"". I figure the best and most straight forward deal will be at a semi local furniture outlet, known for the three guys that started it Nick Ron and Pete. So come holiday weekend, sale begins I go in. There's like five dudes on the floor in mattresses alone. I walk in and it's like being cornered by lions. I very loudly and very clearly state ""This is whats up, I need a mattress. I already did my bargain shopping, I know I'm buying it here but I really want to make sure I get the RIGHT ONE. Which means I am going to lay down on the mattress for a minimum of five minutes, in different positions, and ensure they are comfortable. I do not need assistance at this moment.""

Long story short, all but one dude in there comes up and bothers me while I'm trying them out. Telling me I should buy this I should buy that I need this one have I tried that one over there? What about this? Each one I politely rebuff, say no thanks, don't need help. They are persistent to a douchebaggery level until I snap at each one and tell them when I need help I'll friggen ask for it now back off. It's like a contest to see who will win my sale.

Maybe 45 minutes later, I decide on a mattress. I walk up directly to the guy who did not offer me assistance after my proclamation of leaving me the fuck alone, and tell him I'm ready. Other salesmen behind desk go APESHIT. I can see the whispers. The guys asks why me? I tell him he's the only one that listened to my needs as a customer.

Knowing sales, and having had sales stolen from me before I wanted to make sure all his bases where covered. Manager comes over, looks worried. I let him know he has a great salesman in ___ and that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES did my sale belong to any of the other reps, and a brief summary of what I had requested upon entering department. The manager laughs and shakes my hand, and when the rep gave me his card he wrote on the back YOU ARE AWESOME!

Inspirations365,79,,199,1n8x8n,,728,"Hey, all.

So I work at Nerd Herd as a favor and I really like my job! People trash us, along with our yellow and blue owner all the time, but I really try to steer my customers in the right direction. It's really rewarding when I can help someone and solve their problem right there at the counter.

What I *dont* like is entitlement complexes. I'm downright allergic to them. Whip out an attitude and I will turn into an immovable object. 

So, onto the story. 

Earlier this week I'm working, along with another coworker, both of us helping customers with phone issues which takes a while. Nerd Herd tries to emulate the Apple customer experience by mandating customers to have ""reservations"", which means you can schedule a time to be seen before coming into the store, or check in with customer service and wait in line. In addition to the two customers being helped, there's two other customers waiting. One gentleman with an appointment, and one lady that is a walk-in who comes in occasionally with some issue with her laptop that we can normally deal with at the counter without charging her and checking her in. Once we help her, she normally sticks around and bums our wifi for a while, whatever. She knows the system.

Well, this particular day she wasn't having it. As I'm still with the phone customer, I see her call over one of the customer service folks to complain about the wait. I double-check the sign-in log and she's been waiting about 10 minutes. Ooookaay. The CS rep apologizes and assures her she will be seen shortly, and tells her that phones do take a while because they require so many steps. 

So as I'm finishing up with my customer I need to head to the back. My CS rep meets me back there and asks if he can just check her in himself, I just need to show him how. I decline flatly, informing him that she's been here quite a number of times and knows the rules, and that checking customers in is not his job, it's mine (This is a good thing. CS reps hate having to help our customers, but they do if we get too busy. Not only were we not busy, but I'd have to leave my customer to help her. Not on my watch.) 

A couple of minutes later I finish with my customer and call up the guy with the appointment. At this point she's been waiting about 15 minutes. 15 minutes too long, apparently. 
""If you don't help me, I'm leaving right now!"" she says. ""Ma'am I'll be right with you or my associate will help you a soon as he's done with his customer-"" ""That's not good enough!"" she cuts me off ass he leaves her laptop on the counter and starts to walk away. I, and everyone else present, was glad she was leaving, but you can't abandon your junk at our store. That causes all sorts of issues down the line. ""Ma'am, you can't leave your laptop here!"" my associate calls after her as she walks out of the store. ""Ma'am-""


I have had enough. ""Excuse me, please"" I say to my customer, and grab her laptop off the counter. I turn and leave the Nerd Herd and walk out of the store after her. I stop outside the doors and see her walking to her car in the parking lot. I call her name to get her attention and she turns around to face me. ""I'm leaving your laptop right here. Have a good night!"" And I place it on the ground next to the trash can by the door so she can't miss it when she comes to pick it up. As I stand up, I see her face, jaw dropped. Satisfied, I turn around, walk back into the store, apologize to my customer who is very gracious and tells me he understands completely, exchange knowing glances with my coworker, and help out my customer.

It takes all of two minutes to help him, so when I finish I promptly find my supervisor and tell him what happened. He nods in understanding and we go back to work.

tl;dr: If you're going to abandon your shitty laptop, allow me to show you where you can leave it. ","What, did you think there weren't going to be consequences?!",927,talesFromRetail

bb_or_not_bb,62,,221,1l0tcc,,734,"My job recently finished a sale that we have every year that the employees affectionately refer to as ""the worst goddamn day of our life"" sale. It's our version of our garage sale when we throw broken, old, and overstocked crap onto a table, mark it down to about 10% it's original cost, and let the customers descend upon it like piranhas feasting on a cow.


Customers (mainly middle age, middle class women) start lining up outside our gate a full hour before we open, pushing and shoving and fighting to get to the sale and fight over a statue missing a head, an ornament celebrating 1999, a strand of Christmas lights in a lovely shade of pee yellow.

The best part of the sale is I get to say no. No we will not box, wrap, bag, that heavily discounted item. No you can't speak to the manager. No you can't get another discount. No no no no no no no. Tis glorious to say no.

This year was shaping up to be a doozy with the ladies (and occasional hapless husband looking confused and frightened) clawing at the gates and looking at their watches and sighing loudly. We opened the gates and in they tore, the guy opening the gates nimbly hopped on a cart to avoid being trampled. Their hands were in claws as they shoved for carts and baskets.

One of my cashiers could not get to safety fast enough. She's eight months pregnant. Her eyes widened with fear as the snarling beast rushed towards her. The lead animal pushed her aside screaming ""MOVE!!!"" The cashier fell into the display racks she was standing next to as the swarm continued passed. Luckily she was not hurt, just mad and scared that her baby could have been seriously hurt.

Me? Well I was fuming. These are GROWN women acting like toddlers and hell, that is not right.

Fortunately for me, the woman who pushed the cashier rolled her junk right through my line. I debating ways to get back at her for shoving as she handed over cash to pay.


She gave me a fifty which I ran through my counterfeit machine. Our machine has a small sensor that squeaks when the magnetic ink is rubbed over it and a small red light that turns on. But she didn't know that. So I had an evil idea. 

I told her the bill was not passing my counterfeit machine and that I could not accept it. She was furious to say the least, with visible steam pouring from her snout. Especially since she had to run down the block to an ATM to get out twenties.

But hey, if you wanted me to make your life easy maybe you shouldn't have shoved a pregnant girl.

Godolin,73,,139,1e70ku,,729,"Warning, this is unnecessarily long.

At my place of employment, we have two titles for workers. You're either a manager or an associate. Managers, their job is pretty straight forward. Paperwork, talking with the owner, and arranging product on the floor.

Associates do everything else. Stocking, checking in product, straightening, and all the janitorial work. That last bit, the janitor stuff, involves cleaning the bathrooms.

Now, I don't mind cleaning the bathrooms. Heck, I actually almost enjoy it. I'm on my own for once, and the bathrooms have great acoustics. So I can sing while I work. But one night... One night, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

The shift itself had been normal enough, with an steadyish flow of customers. Come closing time, my coworker and I divvy up the closing jobs. Seeing as everyone else hates cleaning the bathrooms, I'm home free. I grab my cleaning bucket, cross the store, and get to work.

The women's room was perfectly fine. Felt a little weird being there, as I'm a dude, but you get used to it. The men's room though....

At some point in the day, a customer must have decided ""This toilet isn't smooth enough."" The only reason I've come to that conclusion is because the men's room toilet was *COVERED* in hand lotion. Tank to base, the lid and the seat. Covered. In lotion. It was such a shock that I actually had to sit down on a cabinet just to contemplate it. After a few minutes, my coworker comes in to grab the garbages, sees me sitting, sees the toilet, and promptly joins me on the cabinet.

Now, I'm not a janitor. I don't know what's best for cleaning up hand lotion. Naturally, I default to my manager. After doing my best to explain the situation, she's forced to come to the bathroom with us to see for herself.

Never in my life would I have guessed I'd find myself in a five minute silence as me and two other people stared at a toilet. I also never guessed I'd have to wash an entire toilet with Pinesol.

Minja78,88,,158,1mk507,,728,"So this is from my days at game store. I was opening a new location in the middle of summer with about 10 other employees.  We're on our 2nd to last day before the grand opening.  The gamestore higher ups were notorious for cutting costs any where and every where so the AC could not be turned on yet.  After hours of sweating profusely we decided to open the front and back doors to get a nice cross draft.  On the front door I used packing tape to create 3 'X's across the door (top, middle, and bottom.). In the middle of each X I stuck on signs that said ""STORE CLOSED"" In smaller font grand opening xx/xx. A couple hours goes by and this guy (tg) walks in.  

Tg tears right through two of my beautiful X's ducking under the top one. He literally gave zero fucks. 3 store managers including myslef are standing there dumb founded by the sheer audacity of this goon.  Tg walks over to one of the walls with ps2 games and proceeds to browse. Couple of side notes: There are no lights on in the store, the ps2 section, although near the front window was in no way lit enough to see anything other than the titles on the game cases.

Another manger recovered first and says, ""sir we are closed, we aren't open yet.""  

Tg say, ""Meh it's cool I'll only be a minute."" 

I stood closest to him so i walked over like I was going to sell him something and I said, ""Sir I don't think you understand, this store isn't open yet we grand open in two days. Right now we are building the store. Did you miss the signs up front? Then I increased my snarky to 11, "" You know the ones you destroyed on your way in."" 

Tg, ""yea I saw them but there are other customers in here. If they can be in here I can be in here. Unless your business is discriminating against me."" 

1) This man was an average joe white man. 2) I was dumbfounded and impressed. Well played sir, well played. 

Me, ""Sir, we are closed. Each and everyone in this store is an employee.  The lights are off for a reason. You are more than welcome to come back in 2 days. In fact here's a free discount card on me. (I always had spares ((real easy to print duplicates when someone bought one))).  

Tg, ""Well I want this game can I use this discount card on it?"" 

Me, ""Yes but not today, we don't even have registers yet."" 

Tg, ""Well the math is easy enough (no sales tax here). Do you have a penny? 

Me, Ssir you cannot buy that game today we are not open. I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" 

Tg, ""I want to speak to your manger. Right now!"" 
Me, ""Which one? Every person in this room is a store manager of different stores. I don't understand why this is an issue. You can't be in here for insurance reasons alone. WE ARE NOT OPEN."" 

Tg, ""This is fucking ridiculous, fine you just lost my business and I'll be calling the DA to file discrimination charges against you and this company.""

He stormed out.  Once he got out side the door and off the side walk he looks back, held up his hand, and said ""I'm keeping this game."" 

Had he stole the actual game it was a $9.99 game but he took an empty case.  We spent the rest of the 2 days with a locked front door.  Thankfully we had AC the next day.

It's about 10 minutes from time and I've been going through the motions (balancing the register etc) so I'm well and truly behind the counter when this guy around 19 or 20 walks in. He calls out to me ""Hey, is it okay if I just grab a Coke?"". He's standing over by the fridge which is on the opposite side of the store to me, and I tell him sure. So he opens the fridge, grabs a bottle of Coke, turns around and walks out the door. I briefly pondered chasing him, but I figured what can I do if I get out to the car park and he's chopped half the bottle? Or while I'm out there, someone comes in through one of the other doors and robs the register? Or there's a bunch of guys waiting outside?

zgh5002,67,,150,1bdsbv,,725,"So I'm entering the last week of my employment with a certain retail establishment that sells mostly video games. A few weeks ago, God of War: Ascension comes out, and with it the God of War Sage 5 pack. A customer comes in and wants to buy ""Godawar"" for his kids. I ask him if which one he was after, offering him all his choices. He seems interested in the 5 pack. I explain to him that it does not include the newest game, and it is just a collection of the first five. He says ""That's perfect!"" and off he goes.

Cue to yesterday. I open the store, and right at 10am I get a call from this same guy, ""Yeah, I want to return this game."" So I ask, ""Was there something wrong with it?"" 

""No man, they wanted the new one."" 

""Did you open this one? Is it still wrapped in plastic?""

""Yep, still wrapped in plastic.""

""Cool, if you have the original receipt, I can get you a cash refund or put the full amount towards the right game, whichever you'd like. Otherwise it will be store credit.""

""Cool. I'll see you in a bit.

Cut to a few hours later. The guy comes in, the game is unwrapped and looks like it was chewed on by a dog.

""So can I get my cash back?"" He says this shoving the receipt at me.

""Sorry sir, this game has been opened and it is damaged. I'm not going to be able to do anything but a trade in on it.""

""Well what is the trade in worth?""

""Up to $18 store credit, $8 cash.""

""BULLSHIT! You told me if I brought it in with the receipt, I could get a cash refund!""

""I also asked you multiple times if the game was still sealed up in the plastic, and you told me it was.""

""NO NO NO! You asked me if *I bought it sealed in plastic* I want my cash!""

""Sorry sir, I can't do that. This game is no where near the condition you bought it in, it has been played and it is destroyed.""

""I want to speak to your manager!""

""Sure thing.""

My manager comes over, tells him the same thing and adds:

""Sir, I heard him speak with you on the phone, and he asked you if the game was still wrapped in the plastic. Since you lied to us about the condition, we cannot honor what the receipt in your hand says about returns.""

He starts swearing at us, calling us cock suckers, mother fuckers etc. There were customers starting to look uncomfortable. It was hell. That was when I remembered that my tenure with the company was at an end, and that if this guy files a complaint it isn't going to matter to me.

""Sir, you need to leave the store. That kind of language isn't appropriate, and huffing up your chest and pouting about it isn't going to help you. You're banned. I've taken your name down, and no one else at this store is going to deal with you either. Have a nice day.""

Drunken_Black_Belt,90,,171,147nvp,,723,"Hello TFR!  I have shared many of my Loss Prevention shenanigans over the few weeks I have been on here, but I wanted to share with you the one story that always gets a shocked response whenever it's told.  Now over my LP career at different institutions, I have been assaulted, spit on, seen a large woman remove $600 worth of clothes from her fat rolls, and even ran a couple of miles to grab a suspect.  But this is the only time I have ever seen a parent neglect a child.

Now shoplifters using children is nothing new.  And usually it incurred a charge of child endangerment.  However sometimes the cops would let it slide if the person co operated and the child was so young they had no way of knowing what was going on.  That being said, we begin our tale.

One fine sunny afternoon, I am working at (a store we will call GdNickels), doing my LP thing.  My female co worker, ""Stacy"" is watching these two teenaged girls, pushing baby carriage around, with a blanket covering the inside of the carriage.  The two girls are acting suspicious, removing clothing without looking at size, style, or price, and taking multiples of each item. Classic signs of shoplifting.  The two girls eventually proceed into a female fitting room, and my co worker goes to get ready to verify that they did not exit with the items and that the fitting room was empty.  

Now our store was two stories right in the middle of the mall, and this fitting room was in the top story right near the exit into the mall.  Sure enough the two girls exit, not a single piece of clothing to be seen. Stacy goes in, verifies the stalls are empty, and right at this time the girls are exiting.  I tell Stacy that the STOP is good, and to proceed.  Now our LP office was on the other side of the store, near the parking lot. So I had to exit the office, and proceed through the store to get to my co worker in case anything happened, without running or causing a scene.  As I am rounding the final corner at a fast walk, I hear Stacy yelling ""HEY STOP COME BACK"".  I round the corner, and out in the mall, about 40 yards away I see Stacy with the baby stroller, no suspects in sight.  I run over and Stacy is standing there going ""They both ran, opposite directions, but I didn't go because theres actually a baby in here.""  

Wat?  

They actually left a real live baby, presumably one of their's, in the stroller when they ran.  I told Stacy to call the cops, bring the kid inside and take care of it, and I'd chase after one of them. Stacy pointed the way of the food court and said ""The fat one went that way.""  Like a slightly overweight lion, chasing after a gazelle the size of a hippo, the chase was on.  

Now our company, as do most, have rules of when you can and cant engage a shop lifter, and when you can and can't give chase.  As with most stores, if they go into the public parking lot, you can't chase, as its a liability.  However in the mall, we had a good standing, so as long as they were in public mall space, and I wasn't knocking old women and 3 year old out of the way, I could chase them to my hearts content.  At this point, Suspect A, who we shall name Queen Hippo, had a 20-30 second head start.  So But our mall was straight, so I could see her waddling in the distance.  I take off, gaining ground trying to not run into anyone. Mall security sees me and starts squaking on the radio.  At one point, I almost hit someone and end up stopping short and falling head first and sliding a short distance, at which the phone kiosk guy yells ""HE'S SAFE"" to chuckles all around. I admit I had a laugh too as I got myself up and took off running.

Anyways, I catch up with the girl right in the food court.  As I'm commanding her to stop, she turns and starts attempting to swing at me.  Fortunently for her, the police who are always in the mall have been alerted and are right there, so they grab her before I can.  She starts yelling that I am chasing her, tryna ""grab on her goodies"", and they should ""get dis white boy offa me"".  The cops naturally just look at me and say ""What have we got Drunken_Black_Belt?'  I tell them shoplifting pants and such.  She of course continues to say she doesn't know what we are talking about and that I'm tryna rape her.  So thats when I drop the big bombshell:

""Ok, we will get this sorted out, but first we need to know. The baby you abandoned, is it yours or the other girls?""  

The cops naturally have a look of ""WAT?"" on their face.  I explain the two girls left a baby behind, and that  Stacy had it.  The girl starts saying its her baby, and that her friend said she'd watch it while she ran from me tryna grab her goodies. I explained that her friend took off too and left her baby there.  She says she doesnt know what I'm talking about and I'm lying. The cops naturally tell her to shut up and start dragging her back to our office.  

I radio Stacy en route, let her know we are on our way back. She informs me the kid is ok, and we have Queen Hippo's license in her purse so its even more proof.  We get Queen Hippo back in the office, cops search her, we sit her down.  Show the cops everything we have, they interview Stacy to get her side with the baby, who was like 8-9 months or so.  So the cops sit down, and explain to Queen Hippo that Department of Child Services are already going to be contacted for an investigation.  But if she lied to them even once, and didn't tell them everything, then they would call them now to have the baby taken away within the hour.  Naturally Queen Hippo broke down, told us who her friend was, who they were stealing for, and even where they were fencing the goods they stole.  Full on ORC info that was gold to us.  Her friend was contacted and told to turn herself in by the end of the day or she'll be charged with child endangerment as well.  Queen Hippo had her kid taken away while they did the investigation (Sorry no info about how that ended up), we got our merch back, a ton of ORC info, got to play with a cute baby for an hour while the cops did their thing, and a quick workout on my part.  All in all a good day.

My main job is in the fashion's department, however I (along with many of the GM team members) often get called up to run a lane when it gets backed up. It sucks, it's annoying but it's my job so I do it without complaining. Much.

Today I get called up. I'm a little annoyed because I've got a few things that need to get done before I get to go home, but it doesn't bother me too much because I was closing with K, and K is awesome.

So I'm up running a lane, scanning groceries and whatnot and I get to the end of the order. ""Alright, your total comes to $76.89.""

""You wouldn't happen to have any other form of payment would you? I'm technically not allowed to accept this much change."" Which is complete and utter bullshit since we're not allowed to tell customers no to anything.

Mikomaxless,98,,139,1hwxr2,,725,"So. This is a story back when I was the floor manager at a college food court/convenience store. One entrance that leads to a burger place, a sushi place, pizza, taco bell, and express sandwiches. Also a bunch of energy drinks and snacks. You know, stuff you could probably get at a gas station. Although it was at a college so it's all extremely overpriced.

My job, in addition to being the manager, is to watch out for theft. The college I worked for had a very strict policy. Students caught stealing from the college were promptly dropped from all of their courses with no refunded and expelled from the school permanently. No excuses.

This is actually posted on a sign under our hours. Two and a half years into the job and I never caught anyone stealing. Until the winter, when some douchey frat boy walks in. I see him walking around the food court, looking around. This isn't the looking around that you look at the menus, trying to figure out what you want. This is the looking around you do when you are trying to steal. When he thinks I'm not looking, he puts energy drinks into his jacket. I put a quick call for the campus security to show up on the radio, just in case. I know the guy, he's downstairs and at the door in two minutes.

However, I don't find it in good taste to kick a kid out of college. So, I give the kid a chance. After pocketing about ten energy drinks, and every cashier has noticed him stealing by now and is giving me looks. I wave it off, giving them the signal that I'll handle it. He looks at this cell-phone, saying ""Shit, I gotta get to class!"", and proceeds to power walk down the ramp out of the store. I'm already at the railing, and I grab him by the arm. Here's how the conversation went.

Me: ""I honestly didn't think you'd try to walk out with it all. Are you insane? Did you think I wouldn't notice?""

Him: ""W-what are you talking about?""

Me: ""Look, I know you have a bunch of energy drinks in your jacket. In case you didn't know, if you get caught stealing from us, not only do you go to jail, you also get kicked out of school permanently.""

Him: ""Bullshit! You can't prove I stole anything!""

Me: ""Look. I won't tell anyone if you just put the drinks back. But if you try to walk out that door with all that, your life is going to be ruined.""

Him: ""Fuck you, you can't tell me what to do!""

He then proceeds to walk out. I quickly do a quick call on the radio, and my campus security promptly arrests him about 15 feet away from the store. I walk over there, and the officer assists me in taking the drinks out of his jacket.

Me: ""You really had to call my bluff, huh? Don't say I didn't warn you.""

Him: ""FUCK I DIDN'T MEAN IT! YOU CAN'T KICK ME OUT OF SCHOOL!""

Me: ""Sorry kid. Maybe you can still get a good degree at community college.""

I promptly cleaned off the energy drinks and put them back on the shelf. About a week later my security campus friend tells me what the kid's fate was. Kicked out of school.

Tl;dr: Kid stole from a college store and got kicked out of college for it after being warned he would be kicked out for it.

JizzBeef,179,,165,1qutuf,,714,"Today at my gas station job a woman came in to get some cigarettes. Now we have a policy (and also it's kind of the law here) that if we think you look under 40, we need to see your ID. I know it may seem a little odd, but w/e, I do it cuz in the slim chance I sold alcohol or tobacco to a minor I'd be fired, fined, revoked of my liquor license,  and I think I'd see time in jail as well. So anyway, this lady looks like she's maybe 20 or 30, but I've seen people that look older but their ID shows a different story, so I ask her for her ID anyway. Our exchange goes like this:

Me: may I please see your ID?

Lady: I don't have it, but I'm over 18

Me: I can't sell you cigarettes without seeing your ID, it's against company policy

Lady: I know that! But I don't give a shit. My year of birth is 1986!

Me: lemme see that on your ID.

Lady: look, I told you I don't have it! This is bullshit... can't you just get somebody that works here everyday to confirm my age? I'm a regular here, I come in here like 3 times everyday for the past six months!

I turn to my manager, then I remember two things:

1. My manager is new, and he only works on the weekends

2. I work everyday, and this lady is just a fucking idiot.

45 minutes later she was back, with her ID. Sheepishly defeated, she didn't say anything during the transaction. If she truly is a regular I plan on asking for her ID everytime I see her from now on. I'll just pretend like I don't remember her.",1986,879,talesFromRetail
claytoris,140,,140,1dlx0r,,717,"I work at a grocery store. We have this regular customer who comes in once a month and orders a pallet of flour, which works out to fifty 50lb sacks. The customer shows up several days late to pick up her order, so it gets buried behind several stacks of empty pallets in our back room.

The customer comes in and is in a hurry, as always. Blocking her pallet is a stack of empty pallets 30 high, as well as several bales of cardboard that are going to be picked up by our freight driver later in the afternoon. I start to move the stack of bales and notice that 3 of the 4 wires have snapped and the boxes are falling apart on the bale in the middle. I restring wires around the bale and attach it to the pallet on top of it so it's all secure. This takes about 10 minutes and requires the assistance of another employee. 

Then I attempt to move the stack of 30 pallets with the power jack, but upon shifting it slightly to the right, the whole tower starts to lean and is going to crash through the wall. I drop the stack quickly and it straightens out. Okay, I'll just use the forklift to separate the monster stack into two smaller stacks.

By now my manager is calling me on the intercom to bring this stuff up to the front and I talk to her briefly to explain the situation. She gives me shit but lets me get back to work. She gives me shit about everything, but always in a funny way. Good boss, that one. 

I finally get the empty pallets out of the way and start to bring out this pallet of flour. I get it almost out onto the sales floor when I notice that two of the bags have ripped wide open and flour is spilling everywhere. Two of the bags on the BOTTOM of the pallet, of course. 

No way to get to those other than unloading EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. BAG. 

So I am sweating like a slave hucking bags of flour onto the floor. I get the two broken bags and set them off to the side, then restack the remaining 48 bags onto the pallet. If I wasn't a strongman competitor in my spare time and reasonably strong, this would have been even more miserable.

Pallet loaded, boss is screaming because customer is screaming, and I'm covered in sweat and flour as I make my way up to the front of the store. Boss laughs at my appearance, which actually calms my anger a bit. I grabbed two bags of flour from their regular spot on the shelf to bring my pallet total back up to 50.

I follow the customer out to her car because I'm the only jackass available for the carryout apparently and she opens up the hatch to this:

http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/194106/2009-chevrolet-traverse-interior-photo-194130-s-1280x782.jpg

By now, I had already assumed that she drove a tiny ass vehicle because fuck me that's why.

I start loading bags into the back and she is playing armchair quarterback about the positioning of every bag. I get about 30 bags into the back, close the hatch because I think she has a second vehicle or some stupid fucking reason, and then she says that whatever doesn't fit in the vehicle she will need to return back to the store for a refund.

Well, hell no.

I open the hatch back up and start getting creative. Years of Tetris have prepared me for this moment. I manage to shove another 10 bags into every crevice I can find. I stack the remaining 9 bags on the front passenger side. And I've got one bag.

One.

Bag.

I crawl into the driver's side and shove the massive stack around so I can stand up the last bag of flour behind her seat. 

When I walk back through the front doors of my store with the empty pallet on the pallet jack, I daydreamed that all my coworkers and managers would be there cheering for me and holding up ""YOU DID IT"" banners. They weren't, of course, but I felt victorious nonetheless. ",The one where I shoved 2500lbs of flour into a customers compact SUV,857,talesFromRetail
ShiftingTheParadigm,218,,134,1hguxz,,716,"*Background info: I work in the foods department of a medium department store in the middle of a city. The store I work for, like most others in the UK, has a policy known as 'Challenge 25', which basically means that anyone buying age-restricted products who looks 25 or younger should be challenged for ID to prove that they are old enough to buy them.*

A couple of weeks ago, a customer came through my till who was clearly under 25 and trying to buy only a bottle of wine, so I challenged her:

Me: ""Do you have any ID on you?""

Customer: ""Please, I'm in a hurry.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I need you to prove that you are old enough to buy this product.""

The customer then proceeded to give me one of the dirtiest looks I have ever received.

Customer: #sigh# ""Reeeeeally?""

Me: ""Yes please.""

The customer then made a huge show out of what was essentially taking her purse out of her bag and getting out her driver's license. She showed me her ID (showing she was 22), and shouted ""There! Happy?!""

Me: ""Thank you very much. That will be £xx.xx.""

Customer: ""...hold on, are you even old enough to sell me this?""

I was, and so I replied to say that I was. Then, with a smug grin on her face, she replied, ""Well then, can I see *YOUR* ID?""

After a moment of stunned silence, I replied: ""Sorry, I am not allowed to have anything like that with me whilst working on the shop floor.""

Customer: ""Ha! I've caught you out, haven't I? I want to speak to your manager!""

So I rang the bell and my manager walks over.

Me: ""This customer wants to see my ID.""

After a few moments to take in the situation, it clicked. His face turned bright red, and he was quite visibly fighting the urge to burst out laughing when he replied that I was indeed authorized to be selling her the wine so long as she was old enough, then turned to me and asked if I had made sure to check her for ID. The customer was not impressed at all by this reaction, and continued to pay (by card, which was in her purse behind her ID), and my manager walked away into the back room and shut the door.

Just as I was handing her her receipt, audible through the door leading to the back room, my manager could not hold the laughter any more, and burst out into hysterics. Her face went red, she snatched her receipt, turned and stormed off.

Me: ""Excuse me!""

The customer turned back, giving me the same dirty look from before.

Me: ""You forgot your wine.""

WingedReign,81,,187,1nvinr,,713,"Again, working at the vet, it seems that I get all of the crazy clients.  

It’s Friday, and we have one client who has 5 dogs; all yip-yaps and hyperactive.  This client frequently travels up the state and down the state, so she has one vet up north and one down south.  Because her records are faxed back and forth between these places, we’re pretty familiar with the staff up there.

It’s important to note that this client is always terribly confused; we’re not sure what meds she’s taking, but we’re pretty sure she’s flying high on it 24 hours a day.   There have been numerous occasions where this client has scheduled an appointment with the vet up north, showed up on our doorstep stating she has an appointment for her 5 dogs, and we just stare at her because she is nowhere in our books.  Then she proceeds to yell at us calling us idiots and other profane names, demanding that we fix what we screwed up.  This. Happens. Frequently. And usually when it happens, the receptionist calls the vet up north and asks THEIR receptionist if she’s scheduled with them…  anddd she is.  But there’s NO WAY that this client has messed up and scheduled with the wrong vet, so we need to see her 5 dogs right away!

The catch is that we have 2 vets at the practice we work at: one male, one female.  She always sees the MALE doctor because he is “the dog whisperer” to her, and she throws a fit if he’s not there.

Well he wasn’t there today, and now mom is pissed.

She agrees to see the female doctor.  Our female vet and I walk in and start getting the history.  She spends a good hour and a half with the vet talking to her about kennel cough and how her one dog started coughing, then the rest of them started coughing, now all of them are coughing and have nasal discharge coming from their noses and it’s making her crazy.  Our vet did her routine thorough physical on each dog, agreed that this appears to be kennel cough and a good round of antibiotics should clear it up.   The woman then spends another good 30 minutes talking about how she normally sees the MALE doctor because he’s just “magical” and while this vet did a good job, she still wants to see her normal vet. 

Sure, no hard feelings.  The woman looked pleased and left the office with antibiotics for each dog.  Easy as pie!  ………….Nope.

Two days later, this woman comes back in.  She’s livid because her oldest dog has a CUT on his LEFT PAW and the vet DIDN’T NOTICE IT when she brought all of her dogs in, which is why she always sees the male doctor and the male doctor only!

The receptionist looked at the paw and stated that it’s only a knick about 1/4inch long and very shallow.  She suggested Neosporin, but was INSTANTLY shot down by the client stating she wants to see the MALE VET!   Our receptionist told her that he was not in today either, but she can schedule the P to be looked at.  The woman huffed and puffed about it stating that she has to bring all 5 dogs in again.  Our receptionist asked if it was ALL of the dogs that had cuts and the woman said no, only the one dog.  She then asked if the client would be able to only bring the ONE dog and this woman was just offended. “No! Of course NOT, WHAT are you thinking!??!”   Knowing better, our receptionist apologized and started to make the appointment for all 5 dogs to come in tomorrow.

The woman then STATED to the receptionist: honestly, how could you even keep a horrible vet like that woman?  She didn’t even know that I was going to cut my dog’s paw while grooming him on Saturday!  

Our receptionist paused for a moment and asked again when the woman said she groomed her pet.  The woman again replied, “SATURDAY!  Are you DEAF?”  …The receptionist looked in the records and called me back to ask when it was we saw this patient.  We checked the records and statements: we saw this patient on FRIDAY.  The cut on the paw didn’t happen until SATURDAY!

We explained this to the woman, who then started screaming at us that SHE’S WELL AWARE HER APPOINTMENT HAPPENED BEFORE THE CUT, BUT THE VET SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CUT THE PAW WHILE GROOMING AND GAVE HER MEDICINE OR TOLD HER NOT TO GROOM THE PET HERSELF!  Then stormed off.

She never did come in for her appointment that next day, but when we called the vet up north, they informed us that she was there “for her appointment""...and that vet suggested Neosporin.",You should have warned me that I would cut my dog’s paw!,900,talesFromRetail

I work at a small retail store that sells batteries and light bulbs.  Thankfully I now work almost exclusively in the tech center building custom orders (rebuilding drill packs, rewiring fisher price cars, gluing together suspicious acme products, etc.), so i don't have to deal with many day to day customers anymore.  

A woman came in with a battery for some sort of chair lift, i think it may have been a poolside chair to help disabled people in and out of the water.  She was wondering how much it would be to replace it, so i opened it up and found that a wire had simply decided to snap in half (seriously, it wasn't near anything that could pinch it or cut it).  So i took it and grafted the wire back together.  I hand it back to her, who now has a confused look on her face.

me: here you go :)

customer:... well how much is it?

me: no charge, it was just a broken wire.

She thanks me and leaves the store.  about twenty minutes later my coworker sees her coming back into the store and jokingly warns me that i must have messed something up.  She comes back to the tech center and hands me two bags full of tacos and burritos!  There is a del taco across our parking lot.

beefstick86,67,moderator,216,1loh0s,,714,"5 years ago I started working in the copy center of my local retail store.  It was a new and exciting experience for me to have such a large crew to work with and customers who are not always harassing you for not remembering what smokes they buy.

Two months later a new employee is added to our copy center crew.  I knew the name, but couldn't quite picture his face.  Growing up in a small town like mine, it feels like you pretty much know everyone.  His name was Nick and we were in the same graduating class.  I didn't know anything about him, but that would all soon change.

Another employee that was in the copy center explained how this new hire was a jerk in high school and a big jock and how I should look out for him.  Again, I only remember the name so made it a point to look him up in the year book when I got home.  Sure enough... he was in just about every sport and club the school had to offer.

The next day he showed up in uniform and I was to train him.  He was a foot or so taller than me and looked like a party boy.  All I remember thinking was, ""Great... this ought to be interesting"".  We started talking a little and naturally I thought he was a D-bag who just wanted to score with women, so I kept my opinion to myself.

Skip ahead two months, after talking many times at work, through facebook, and hanging out... I decide to hook up with him.  At this point, I had been living on my own for 5 years and completely by myself for 2 of them.  I wasn't a ""bachlorette frog"", but I was pretty happy not dating anyone.

After the hook up, I had to work the next day and he had off.    A friend of mine from out of town was coming up and I had convinced him to be my ""date"" for the evening because it was valentines day and I wanted a fancy dinner.  When I arrived at work, there were flowers and a card for me.  I thought it was my friend from out of town being silly, yet it still didn't seem right.  I tried to call Nick to ask if he had something to tell me and then he confessed to sending me the flowers.  It was adorable and I didn't know how to explain to all the other co-workers that it was one of the fellow employees who gave them to me.  Not to mention I was embarrassed for being the only person to receive flowers and not being entirely sure the story policy on dating co-workers.

That night I went out for a few drinks and dinner with my friend from out of town.  As always when he stays, I gave him my couch, a glass of water, and bid him a good night and safe travels in the morning.   

The next day I had the day off to recover from drinking and I got a knock on the door around 6pm; it was Nick.  I answer the door and he says he needs to talk.  He sits next to me on the couch grabs my hands and looks at me right in the eyes and says, ""I don't know about the other guys, or why you're even still single.  I just want you to know I haven't had a girlfriend since high school and I'm in this for the long haul.  There's something about you I don't want to give up"".  At first I didn't know what to say except, ""Let me think about it"".  He was a great guy and I knew he really liked me.... but there is something great about being alone and independent.  


The next day I tell him ok, but we have to find out about the work rules and see if it's permitted.  It was, so we began dating.

3 1/2 years later he quit to work at a position in his field of study and I quit 6 months after him to pursue my engineering degree.  This weekend, after being together for 4 1/2 years, we got engaged.  I guess he was right when he said he was in this for the long haul.

smedwards,9,,172,1lz1n7,,706,"I've posted on here before about my time working in a chain bakery in my final few years of high school. I'll post the link to that story at the bottom for anyone curious.

This is a story about something nice that happened while I was at work one Saturday. I was the most qualified person working in the store as it was approaching lunch time and we had our formal manager due in at 12pm. Naturally, I was busy trying to make sure everything was running smoothly and all the necessary prep was done for her arrival. 

That's when a sweet old lady approaches the counter with her middle-aged daughter in tow. The middle-aged daughter asks me where the nearest bathroom is and I grimace as I point across the street to a park/soccer field where the public toilets are about 400m away. This old woman was seriously fragile looking and her daughter tells me her mother is on medications and won't be able to walk that far and do we have a staff bathroom she can use. I start to tell them I'm *really* not allowed to let people use the staff toilet and their faces fall. Then, before I realise what I'm doing, I've offered the old woman my arm and am escorting her to the back of the store so she can use our staff bathroom. Customers aren't allowed back there for several reasons. Not only do they have to walk behind the counter and be a possible security risk to the register, but, also, the bathroom is not always the cleanest so we are told not to let customers see it in case they get ideas about our store's cleanliness standards from it. All the while it's about 11:55am and I'm expecting the manager any second to come in and chew me out for letting someone back here.

The elderly lady uses the restroom and I help her wash her hands before taking her back out to the front to her daughter. They both thank me profusely and set off on their way up the street to look at other shops, I imagine. Thinking nothing more of it since the manager hadn't arrived, I went about my business and then, once the manager showed up about 10 minutes later, I went on my lunch break. I walked up the street towards the local sandwich place and who should be in line in front of me but the old woman and her daughter. We smile at each other and they then step up to the register to pay for their meal. I pull out my wallet when my turn comes only to be told by the guy behind the counter that my sub had been taken care of by the ladies in front of me because ""I could have gotten in trouble and thank you"". 

That stands as one of the nicest things anyone ever did for me related to that job.

   So I was cashiering a friday night closing shift as usual counting down the minutes until I could escape. A middle aged man walks up to the counter with a few items acting generally friendly as I scan his groceries. I finish the transaction and hand him his receipt and bill part of his change. He studies the receipt for a few seconds turns to me and asks ""Do you go to school around here?"" in a friendly tone. I respond with a yes telling him where Ill be going to college next semester.
     His response caught me off guard. His tone switched from genuine interest to disgust as he said ""Good, because you owe me 66 cents."" I could see it in his eyes. This man thought he had called an eighteen year old stupid in the most clever way possible. The man had a smirk on his face as if he had just beat me in a rap battle. I was taken back at first but quickly realized how truly wrong he is. With a smile on my face I pointed to the remainder of his change in the coin dispenser cup.

Today, I bring you another wonderful story of a self entitled housewife who believes her home is better than everyone else's. It was my first few weeks of working my job, and I was just a customer service grunt. I had yet to be promoted up to a manager position in my current department. It was about 6:00PM and I picked up the call like any other. The woman in this story will be **Entitled Housewife or EH**. I, as always, will be **Me**.

**Me** ""Fake Business Name, imhometakemedrunk speaking, how may I assist you this evening.""

**EH** ""Well, I doubt you can help me, but I'll give you a chance.""

Great start....

**EH** ""It's 555-555-5555""

**Me** ""Okay Entitled Housewife. What can I help you with?""

**EH** ""Your technicians came here this morning and scuffed up my brand new hardwood floors. They stomped around dropping things like dumb assholes and left dents and scuff marks everywhere and you're paying for it to be replaced!""

**Me** ""I'm sorry to hear your concerns. Looking at the notes here, you had a service call three weeks ago. Are you sure you had another one today? We don't have a ticket on file.""

**EH** ""Does it matter when it happened? They fucked my floors up and I want it compensated. From your paycheck!""

**Me** ""Well mam', this seems to be a very serious accusation. We address all concerns with technicians very seriously. Please hold for a moment while I bring this directly to my supervisor.""

I quickly go to my boss and explain the situation. He laughs and says ""Well buddy, time to sink or swim. Make this woman thank you at the end of the phone call. I'm going to listen in the whole time. Good luck!""

You're fucking shitting me? I've been here just under a month and you expect me to fix this issue? Yeah, alright..

**Me** ""Thank you so much for holding, I apologize for your wait. I brought this account to my supervisor and he would like for me to handle this issue for you personally. So here is what I would like from you to ensure that we have this resolved. Please photograph the damaged areas. What we will do is find the technicians that went to the home and discuss the issue with them. I am very sorry that someone that represents our company damaged your home. Once we get an estimate for the repairs, and find who did this we will be sure to reimburse you in full.""

**EH** ""Bullshit! I'm not having it fixed! You're redoing the whole floor. Then, because I had to deal with this I'm getting my account free for the rest of the year and you guys can pay to have my bathroom tiled.""

**Me** ""Mam', I understand that this is a stressful situation, one that you should not have to go through. We are a security company, not a remodeling business. I can, however offer you a month of monitoring at no cost.""

At this point the woman loses it and starts screaming. I look at my boss who has a huge shit eating grin on his face enjoying every moment of my pain. I'm starting to stutter on the phone, lose patience, and fear that this woman is going to strangle me through the receiver. At that moment, the phone switches hands and **Badass Husband or BAH** takes over.

**BAH** shouting into the background, ""Shut the fuck up you crazy broad! I'm sorry sir, please ignore my wife. She's upset that our floors were put in wrong. Here's the deal, we didn't have a service call today and none of your techs damaged our floors. In fact, the service call we had recently was before any remodeling was even done in our home. My wife is pissed at the wrong company and decided to take it out on you. We love your service and are happy to have it. I apologize for any confusion.""

**Me** ""Umm, I, well, er...thank you sir?""

**BAH** ""If my wife calls back in, please contact me on my cell and hang up on her. We've been put through the ringer her from this other company. It's not your problem, it's ours.""

**Me** ""Well sir, thank you for your honesty. If you ever need anything, give me a call directly. You've been a pleasure.""

Call ends. My manager can't believe the outcome. I feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. The following day a bill comes into our office directed to me with the cost of the floor repairs from the wife with an angry letter. The overall cost for the hardwood floor job? $3,800. About 1/10th of what she quoted. Just another nut job looking to scam someone for a problem she isn't happy with.

The woman did call in one more time a week later a lot more calm and collected asking why we hadn't paid the bill yet. Another rep took the call, saw my notes and informed her that this wasn't something that was our issue and she is to call her remodeling company if there is a problem, not her alarm company. She politely thank the other rep and never called back. 

**TL;DR** Woman calls in stating we owe her $35,000 for damaging her hardwood floors. Husband takes over call and informs us she is lying. She sends in a bill for the work done for a total of $3,800. After we say no she thanks us and lets it go.","You owe me $35,000!!!",861,talesFromRetail
only1mrfstr,102,,145,1k18cs,,705,"This story is from quite a while ago, but seems appropriate here.  

Lets go back in time to a time of wonder and cheer.  Clinton was president and I was working at a big box retail store.  I worked in electronics and, come October 2000, the gaming world was turned on it's side by the Playstation 2.  

As with all large corporations, our company had set protocols, limits, etc on how to handle the release of the machine.  I was excited... I couldn't buy one yet but I volunteered to work the release just because.  We get the typical speech.  Employees can't buy them if on the clock, no putting systems aside for friends, all stock must be sold, etc.  

So, I forget how much we had but it wasn't much.  I want to say 9 or 10 systems.  We sell the systems, sell some games and peripherals and whatnot.  Almost as quickly as it began, it was all over.

****Tangential note****  most amusing was the Hot wheels collectors who argued with management that it was unfair to let the PS2 line people in first (huh?) and they were afraid the people in that line were LYING about being there to get a PS2 in order to get in first to get to the Hot Wheels.  Yes... that happened.  Look, I'm a geek, I collect GI Joes... but Hot Wheels people are, by far, the biggest freaks of the collecting world.

****TANGENT OVER****

So, the PS2 rush is over and the people in my department just take that moment to chat... even the supervisor, who we will call SH for Scandalous Ho.  Another team member walks up, talks to SH for a minute.  SH asks me to go to the back room, the games cage and tells me where to find 2 PS2's in there.  Huh... I kinda laugh to myself... thought that wasn't allowed but whatever... it was her call.  Transactions made, go about my day.  

Forward to the following week.  I get to work and almost immediately am called up to the offices where I'm introduced to Katie, the regional head of Loss Prevention.  Her and the head of the store's LP team have a few questions for me regarding the PS2 release. 

Uh Oh.

Well, they ask some general questions... how did I think it went, did I feel safe, were people pushing, etc.  They asked if I had any concerns or anything to say regarding the release.  That's when the pit hit my stomach.  I knew they were fishing about the PS2's that had been held but I answered the questions exactly to what was asked and offered little else... not being evasive, but rather just taking the question to be straight-forward and answering in kind. 

Then, it comes.  Katie asks me what I would think if she said they have me on camera getting 2 PS2's out of the stockroom and selling them after the initial rush, that they had been held for certain people.  They hint, very heavily, that I was the one that put them away and even point out that I was smiling on camera.  I explain, first, I' am a gaming fan and was just excited so that explains my smile.  It dawned on my pretty quickly the cameras are the entire reason my supervisor, SH, had me get the PS2's from the stockroom... and had me ring up the transaction.  I don't think she did it out of spite or hate... simply I was the newer person to the team and easier to set up.  So I tell Katie and LP guy exactly what happened.  I wasn't going down for this.  I didn't do shit and I'm not going down for her.  Katie says she believes me completely... asks me to write down everything I've said. 

We finish our meeting and she says I can go back to electronics but instructs me not to talk about what happened with anyone.  

the next day I go to work.  After clocking in, I'm headed back to Electronics and I pass SH.  She's walking but looks absolutely sad... shaken.  She's also carrying her purse and a box with some stuff in it.  It was pretty obvious what happened.  

She was fired.  People talked.  I played dumb... didn't know what happened.  There was one guy I worked with I got to be very good friends with that I eventually told... but I think that was after I left that job.

So i was working at a higher end department store in the womens shoe section. It was a monday and i had the opening shift (yay!) Morning is going along rather quietly, i scanned in all our new inventory, did a soft check on everything else, and scanned the new clearance items into clearance and set them out in the clearance section. 
11 am comes around and this little old lady just starts stacking boxes of orthopedic clearance shoes into a chair nearby. Seems to be stockpiling them all to try on, whatever. She is the only one here and i dont care because clearance means i dont have to run up and down our two floor stock room getting shoes in her size from the displays. Me and my coworker are casually chatting about our weekends. Old lady number one is trying on shoes from her little old lady shoebox fort. She finds one to her liking and toddles on over to the mirror to check her bad self out.
In swoops old lady number two. She strolls into the department and sees the treasure trove that is clearanced orthopedic shoes on the chair. She teeters over and starts rummaging through the pile. Old lady number one turns around, and upon seeing her bounty being trifled through, lets out a squawk. She toddles as fast as those orthopedics can carry here (which they must have been good orthos since she toddled pretty damn fast) and starts screaming at old lady number 2 to stop stealing her shoes. Me and my coworker are behind the register in our section, an odd ten feet away. The two old ladies begin screaming at each other, about how the shoes dont belong to anyone, but they were hers to try on! Yadda yadda, old lady squawking. all of a sudden boxes start flying and theyre throwing shoes at each other! Me and my coworker are in shock, dont know if we should stop it and laugh. We choose laugh. I ask her if we should call store security. At that moment the phone rings and our security lady is on the phone, asking us what the hell she is watching on the monitors. I give her a rundown of the situation and she starts laughing out loud. She said if they dont tire out in 5 minutes she will come out there. 5 minutes pass and theyre still going at it, rather half heartedly though. Both of them get escorted out of the store without any orthopedic shoes, and i dont even mind having to rebox and stock the mess they made because it was priceless to watch.

I worked retail in an upscale store through college and still take some shifts there because it's extra money and a lot of my friends that I made there still work there, so it's an excuse to hang out with them. Also, I have a few visible tattoos, nothing crazy but totally noticeable.

Anyway, one night I'm out to dinner with my best friend. We like to dress up nice and go out to fancy restaurants and sip wine as we swap terribly inappropriate stories. So here I am, enjoying my second glass, when a woman approaches the table. This woman is a regular at the store I work at part time and is a huge pain in the ass. I somehow always end up being the one to deal with her, and I can't tell you how frustrating and painful my interactions with her are.

Below is the dialogue we shared at the restaurant that night (or my best recollection from memory, but it was only this past Saturday). I shall refer to her as CB, for crazy bitch.

CB: What are you doing here?

Me: Um...I'm trying to eat my dinner with my friend here.

*my friend smiles and says hello, as she doesn't know who this woman is*

CB: Your friend is taking you to dinner?

Me: Actually, I think it's my turn to pay.

*I look to my friend, who nods her head to confirm*

CB: But you can't afford this restaurant. And where did you get those clothes? You can't afford those.

Me: What makes you think you know anything about my financial situation or what I can and can't afford?

CB: You work at [retail store]! You can't make enough money to eat here!

Me: I work at [retail store] part time, but I have a full time job with [well known corporation that everyone in the world has heard of and knows is making tons of money].

CB: WHAT?! How did you get a job there?

Me: By attending [Ivy League university in our city] and obtaining a relevant degree.

CB: You can't have a REAL job! You have tattoos!

Me: Yeah, the company doesn't care about those at all.

PornoManager,55,,159,1jgo1u,,692,"Hello again! Time for some more tales of a porn store manager.

This happened awhile ago, I was the new manager after the last one was arrested on drug related charges (explains why he was always so off). The owner, I call ""Boss Man"" is a strictly business kinda guy. He's rich and arrogant with a shady past and shady friends.

I'm getting paid better then what I would at any other retail place, and I don't have to do much. Boss man comes into my office ""Porno Manager, we need people. We need people now. Hire someone within the week or I'm replacing you"". I tell Boss Man, ""okay, but, I need to know what to do. What kinda questions to ask"". Boss Man looms over me and then gets in real close, his breath smells like booze and he reeks of old cigarettes. ""Porno Manager just ask standard questions. Make some crap up. I have some ""important"" business to attend too"", he explains, and then as he's leaving he shouts out ""Don't make me regret this!""

A week to hire some rookie on, no pressure, eh? Within a day we get 3 resumes submitted. First one I see is poorly written and not even filled out. Into the trash it goes! Second one isn't even english...right into the trash! Third is terrible, the guy has little experience, and lists ""porno watching"" as his hobby. A sad thing to say he's the least terrible applicant, i save his resume and wait till better ones come in.

A few days go by and a few interviews, i reject every last one of them for various reasons. With time running out and me being desperate and going against my better judgment I decide to give the ""porno watcher"" a call. I should have known this would have been a bad idea, I really should have seen the writing on the wall. 

He comes in the next day well dressed and on-time. He gives me a firm handshake and manages to impress me in the interview. Success! Maybe things would not be so bad, maybe I was being too judgmental, I mean it's not as if our job is difficult. How bad could this be? Really? We get him started by Friday, he comes in an hour late. That pisses me off, but, I'll allow it to slide just this once considering it is daylight savings and maybe he made an honest mistake. 

I get him started on the register and just up to date on the products. it'll just be me and him today so I can give him the training he'll need. Today's going to be a slow day today, we'll be lucky to get even one customer, but, who knows. Out of the blue he comes up to me and says ""So, this is a porno store, right? Do girls come in here and get naked and get f-d? Do we got glory holes"", he says, I explain to him that we are not a ""porno store"", as we focus on improving peoples sex lives. ""You mean a porno store, right?"", I just sigh and go off to doing my work. I'm not going to like this guy.

All through the day he keeps asking me stupid questions like where all the girls are or why aren't there any people having sex. As best I do to explain, he just keeps asking more and more questions and he won't stop talking about porn. I'm just glad no customers have come in. Lunch break! I ask if he'll be able to handle the store while I'm gone. He says yes, he'll ""manage somehow"", he says in such an odd tone suppressing a giggle. I tell him if he needs me he can call me on my cell, I'll be across the street at McD. With that I walk off.

After getting my food, I walk back to the store hoping he'll have gotten everything out of his system. I hope he would stop it with the annoying questions. I walk in and he's not at the register. I walk around and hear a moaning sound coming from my office. Oh god, I think, please don't be what I imagine it is. I open the door and there he is with his pants down watching a porno movie on my computer.

""Please tell me you aren't doing what I think you're doing..."", i yell. He looks up and says ""hey man shut the f-ing door"", I don't let him finish. I unplug the PC and yell at him to get his pants on. He rushes to get them on all mad at me ""Whats the big idea anyways"", he says confused as to why I'm so mad. I tell him to get out, he's fired and he's lucky I don't call Police. New Guy is all huffy, and confused ""Whats your problem man? i'm on break. This is a porno store man, why can't i do that here? I'll call your owner and tell him to get me my job back!"", I laugh and rush him out the door ""Boss Man would probably kick your ass. Don't show your face here again"", and i slam the door behind him.

If not, you get raised red lines, and every now and then, an actual cut or two. It's annoying, but it looks worse than it actually feels.

This one day, I was working at the bookstore, and had been in the stock room for the entire morning sorting books out of their boxes into their appropriate sections. I had been at this for at least 4 hours by this point. I then got a call to be backup for one of the booksellers. 

The customer was a really nice gentleman, asking for a book in the Psychology department. I look it up, and then we go and locate it for him. I reach up to grab the book for him, hand it to him and ask if this is the one he was looking for. He thanked me, reached in his pocket and handed me his business card. ""If you ever need somebody to talk to, don't be afraid to call me. There are other options out there, and we can work through this.""

I look down at his card. This gentleman was a therapist. It then dawned on me, as I realize that my shirt sleeves were rolled up from being hot while sorting, exposing my beat up arms from the cardboard box. I turned bright red and began to explain that these were not self inflicted wounds, but from the cardboard boxes that I have been digging through all morning. He seemed hesitant to believe me, softly smiled, and walked away.

_TK_,26,,139,1lj7ud,,697,"I work at a real Canadian supermarket as a cashier (but I manage to do other things too). I don't hate working there, but its not like there aren't better jobs I could have.  
Anyway, I'm one of our fastest cashiers(around 35-40 items per minute), and normally I slow down to not pressure the customers. We don't have to bag in our store, we let the customers do it, and I don't like to rush them.  
So its evening and we're not that busy and a group of Asian people come up with a full cartload of mostly small things like ramen and cans and then a bunch of ethnic produce, which I find impossible to recognize and remember the PLU so I normally have to find a sticker or look it up. They finish loading their groceries up and ask for ~8 bags and then *one* of them goes to bag. I thought: ""Ugh, I'm gonna be here forever."" (It was near my break and I was tired). And this is where it begins.  

I started slow-ish because I stopped caring if I got out of there then. Everytime I scanned an object his hand was ready for it. So I paid attention to him a little more. He could open our flimsy plastic bags very quickly. So I sped up a little. So did he. So I stopped watching him and went full on cashier mode. I get as many small items done quickly to give me time to find the produce codes, but he's catching right up. I got lucky and knew all the produce (yes!) but it still slowed me down. By this time, his friends were actually laughing and cheering at the two of us. I reached the bags of rice and pulled out my hand scanner, zapped the two of them and looked at this fellow who could match me for speed, alone. He bagged the last three items and his friends came over and patted him on the shoulder. (I think they figured he lost the race to me.)

CreatrixAnima,57,,151,1ise3a,,697,"I used to manage a convenience store and we hired this woman - lets call her Evil Whore, or EW for short. EW looked good on paper, but she was not a nice person. EW worked mornings with a lady I will call Ann. Ann's son John worked afternoons with me.

One day, John told his mom something rather surprising and his mom, shocked, confided in EW. By the end of the week, EW had outed John to the rest of the staff and embellished how Ann found out to include her walking in on John and another guy. Fortunately, the staff loved John and rallied around him, but what a nasty thing to do!

In addition to being a bitch, EW was also an alcoholic. (One time, she brought her six-year-old son to work, where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop. Finally, a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid, who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka, lemon juice and sugar.)

Anyway, although things started out alright, eventually it got to the point where, if we scheduled EW to work on a Monday morning, she failed to show up a full 50% of the time. It had been about 6 months since we hired her, which, coincidentally, was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again, when we stopped scheduling her for the 6-2 shift on Mondays. We gave her the 11-3 instead, which, obviously resulted in her losing some hours. EW did not like that.

It was about 11:00 at night and I was at home when my phone rang. It was EW, drunk and yelling at me about her hours. She called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple mantra: ""FIRE ME FIRE ME FIRE ME!""

So I eventually hung up and I called my boss and told her what had happened. We talked a bit and decided EW was more trouble than she was worth, so I called her back and said ""I've thought it over, EW, and I have decided to take your advice and fire you. Goodbye.""

But that isn't the revenge bit. The revenge is when she filed for unemployment. I know a bit about how bureaucrats work, so I decided she wouldn't be getting unemployment benefits this time around. We contested her claim and gave the Unemployment Office my contact information. When they called, they asked me why I had let her go. It went something like this:

Unemployment Guy: ""EW says you cut her hours. Can you explain why that happened?""

Me: ""Well, EW does a good job when she's there, but unfortunately, I think he has an alcohol problem. She hasn't been dependable on Monday mornings, so we decided to let her sleep in.

UG: ""But she was a good employee other than that?""

Me: ""Yes and no. She's good at the work, but she outed a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me. She called me a bitch while I was in my own home. I don't have to put up with that! I was in my living room and she's yelling at me saying 'Fire me, you stupid bitch,' and I am not going to be called a bitch in my own home.""

UG: ""Wait... she asked you to fire her?""

Me: ""Yeah. While calling me a bitch. In my own home, no less!""

UG: ""But she said the words 'fire me'?""

Me: ""Over and over again. But I seriously don't need to be called a bitch in my own home.""

UG: ""But she asked to be fired? Okay, I think you've answered my questions. Thank you.""

Dawnsteel,48,,122,1jxit4,,694,"Back in college, I had a night job as a pump jockey at a gas station near campus. Aside from gasoline, we refilled propane tanks, and sold cigarettes. There was no c- store; these were fuel islands (four self-serve, one full-serve) at a repair shop. 

As you might imagine, we had a great number of regular customers. I mean no misogyny, but the overwhelming majority of full-service customers were older women. One particular lady, we'll call her Mrs. R., drove a blue Mercury Sable. She was the nicest lady, nearly always cheerful, always told me about her family, and asked about me, and always remembered the things I'd told her before.

One Thursday in November, I was at work as usual, but was sick as a dog. I stayed inside the booth as much as possible; my joints hurt when I moved, and just the exertion of walking would make me cough my brains out. (This was 1998, before the ubiquity of hand-sanitizer. I had a package of alcohol wipes I would use to sanitize my hands before handling a customer's credit cards or cash.) Lucky for me, no one pulled up to full-service that shift, until about 8:30, when Mrs. R. rolled in. I went out to meet her.

""Dawnsteel, honey, you look like Death warmed over!"" she says as she hands me her card out of her window.

""Thanks, Mrs. R. I feel about that well, too.""

""Well, what're you doing at work? You should be home in bed!""

""About three more hours, and then two days off. If I have to sleep the whole time, I will, Mrs. R.,"" I said.

""Is your bride-to-be going to feed you chicken soup? Nurse you back to health? She should!"" she declared. I'd told her that I was engaged a couple of months before.

I finished pumping her gas, cleaning her windows, and so on, and sent her on her way. I noticed that when she left the parking lot, she didn't turn toward her house, but I didn't think anything of it.

About a half-hour later, I see her car pull back into the lot, but instead of stopping at the fuel island, she drives past it and up next to the door of the booth. She rolls down the window, and as she hands me a brown paper bag, she says, ""Get well soon!"" and she drives away.

I got back inside and look in the bag. I found a bottle of Advil, two bottles of orange juice, two small bottles of vodka, and a roll of wintergreen Lifesavers. There was a note inside that read, ""The mints are so you'll have fresh breath for get-well kisses.""

miss_engineer,110,,202,1jvw2w,,692,"I went to Old Navy a couple weeks ago and they were having a pretty awesome sale. I snagged a couple pairs of pants that I had my eye on previously, the super skinny ones. 

I go to the register to pay and the cashier asks me if I want to apply for an Old Navy credit card. She told me that if you apply and get denied that you still get 20% off and if you are approved, you get an additional 10. This sounded great to me, so I signed up. I entered in my information and guessed my monthly income. I'm a full time college student, so I obviously have a very small monthly income. 

The application is almost done processing when the cashier's computer freezes. She calls tech support and is on hold for at  least 20 minutes. After that, I have to talk to tech support about my application (after another 20 minutes of the cashier talking to them), to which the nice fellow in India asks me if I have any property, assets, stocks, etc. I tell him no, I'm a poor college student and I live with my parents. I have no money, I just needed a couple pairs of pants! He tells me that my application cannot be processed and that I should look into getting a job that pays well. Thank you, good sir. 

So after a total wait of about 1 hour, which included the silly conversation I had with tech support, my transaction was finally processed. The cashier gave me a total of 30% off because I was so patient and another cashier gave me a $20 Old Navy bonus buck coupon. These ladies were so sweet! I thanked them happily and told them that next time I would speak to their manager about how awesome they were. It pays to be patient!

TL;DR - Order takes a long time to be processed and cashiers reward me with discounts for waiting so long. So sweet. ",Why I Love Old Navy,894,talesFromRetail

Glordit,86,,177,1iapkq,,691,"I work in a pretty large chain store that sells' CD's, DVD's, Blu Ray, Gaming and all sorts of audio visual equipment. We have a somewhat strict return policy on Software, specially PC games as people will purchase them, activate it then reseal it and request an exchange or a refund. 

Friday afternoon a customer and her son come into the store and purchase, 2 PC games - One thats require online activation (Steam, Origin, Uplay etc.) I question if they have the required PC specifications and an internet connection to get the game up and running. Yes Yes Yes! The kid was all too eager to get home and play. 

Fast forward to Sunday Morning, I'm at work and answer the phone: 

**Me:** ***** M*** speaking, how may I help you? 

**Mother:** Hi, I bought this game from you on Friday. It's not working. 

**Me:** Okay ma'am are you sure you check the system specifications, and that you have an active and stable internet connection, also is it giving you and error if so what type?   

**Mother:** Yes... I... I suppose I do. My son bought it he should know. (Inaudible speaking) He says he can't activate? The game. (More inaudible speaking) He says the CD key? has been used already. 

**Me:** Okay, ma'am. Since we are not allowed to do an immediate swop on PC software I am going to have to ask you to, phone the supplier and ask if the code is in fact in use or it was not activated by your son by accident.

**Mother:** How is that my problem, you sold it to me. Why must I do all of this Sh**, you must fix it. NOW! I am not coming in there again to fix it I want it fixed NOW!

There is a slight pause. I'm getting agitated at the mothers response. 

**Son:** Hello? 

**Me:** Hi, sir. As I explained to your mother I am going to ask you to phone the supplier and double check that the code has not been activated by you already, or it is in fact not available. 

**Son:** Wha- You sold me a game that does not work. 

**Me:** I understand sir, but I need you to just check that for me please so we can help you with your exchange. 

**Son:** You sold me a game that's code has been used - You stole it didn't you? 

**Me:** Sir, It is quite possible that you have already activated it, perhaps you have 2 accounts?  

**Son:** YOU STOLE IT! YOU ADMITTED IT! HA! F**KING THIEF!

There is a slight pause and ruffling on the line. I'm now getting to the point where I am ready to slam the phone down in their faces. I attempt to keep my composure. 

**Mother:** You did what? You stole it and admitted to it? 

**Me:** I'm sorry ma'am I do no such thing. I was try-

**Mother:** THIEF! THIRF Who is your manager? I want to speak to them NOW!

Needless to say I gave the phone to my manager I explained the situation before he took the call, he attempted to calm them down but to no avail. 

As they spoke they seemed to have come to an agreement, by giving them a new copy of said game and even had delivering a sealed copy that Monday. 

Monday comes, my manager comes in a bit late. Due to driving about 50 Km (31mi) to give them their game. I asked him how it went, all he could say was. ""When I get home I am going to burn my clothes and take 3 showers of disinfectant, those are the filthiest people I have ever seen"".

Needless to say I took the copy of the ""already activated game"" Called up the customer support and had the key to whom ever the account was linked to suspended on suspicion of theft. Fast Forward a couple of weeks I was not working till that day but the son walks in again takes the same game and says to the cashier ""Yea it's for my brother... Yea his account got hacked, so I gotta get him a new copy. Sucks that it happened the day I got mine"". 

Lying bastard.

TL;DR: Customer tried to swindle free game off me, called me a liar and still came short in the end.

I was asked to do an update on this story, so here it is. Yesterday, to my pleasant surprise, I was at sandwich station. I had been asking for training here because it's a higher level of difficulty and I'm not at this place to shell coffee and not move up any ranks. I'm here to prove myself in every aspect and climb, for my resumé's sake. (Worth noting this is my second job. Ever.) The supervisor, Helga*, pulled me aside before my shift began.

Helga: First I'm going to speak to you as your supervisor. What you did yesterday was unprofessional. You do not speak to customers with a raised voice. However, because you didn't use any profane language and even while you blew up you managed to keep a little bit of cool, you get this ""verbal warning"" (finger air quotes included). Now I'm going to speak to you as a witness to the event. That was fucking amazing and I'm glad it was you of all the employees who gave that shit-eater what for, because you would have done it best. I know you've been asking Horatio* and Shanaynay* for training in sandwich station, because eventually all of us absolutely cannot tolerate the drive-thru speaker anymore. I know you hate it now, I can see it, and yet you still have the same enthusiasm and radio worthy voice we love. You are our best order-taker. Because of this, you are cursed with the speaker box job. However, I'm now going to do my best to get you over to sandwich a couple of times a week for a much needed and deserved break. Go punch in, get to sandwich, and show me what you can do.

I wear the biggest shit-eating grin I've had since I was told I got hired, and go on to have one of the best days of work I've had in months.

glitteryguineapigs,144,,123,1dsyso,,680,"I just found this sub, and would like to share my story.  This is all 100% true.  

I worked at a very large retail chain all through high school, usual big box store with clothes, home goods, prepared food, and a pharmacy.  I worked in the fitting room most of the time, but was also cross trained for the various clothing departments and cashiering.  Typically we had about 7-8 employees helping customers on the floor, 3-4 cashiers, a few people at customer service and a few managers.  It being a relatively large store, we all used walkie talkies and had various short hand for emergencies, ""code yellow"" for a lost child, ""code red"" for a fire, etc.

One fateful day, I heard a flicker on my walkie talkie.
A fellow employee, cool girl Carol*: ""I just, I don't even... I think we have a... a Code Brown...""  
This was uttered on the main frequency that goes through all walkies in the store, we a have a secondary frequency for longer and more private conversations.
""Carol, go to frequency 2!"" barked the manager of the evening.

Whenever something juicy goes down in the store, the manager and whatever employee brought up the issue go to the secondary line to discuss the matter in more detail.  The rest of the employees are supposed to keep their walkies on frequency 1 for general matters (""what aisle are pillow cases in?""/""Need more cashiers!""), but many succumb to curiosity and check into frequency 2.

Manager: ""Carol, what are you talking about?""
Carol: ""In Aisle X, there's just... I think it's poop.  It is poop.  There's so much, it's everywhere, I just don't even...""
Manager: ""What the f*ck?!  I'll be right over!""

Naturally, anyone who heard the quick conversation on frequency 2 dropped what they were doing and ran as fast as their little khaki'd legs would carry them to Aisle X.

Luckily, I was on a break and not trapped behind the fitting room desk, so I dashed to the scene of Code Brown.

I don't know what I was expecting.

First I smelled it.  I saw Carol's face, ashen white with a thousand-yard stare, and then I saw it.  

Human diarrhea.  All over an end-cap in the make up aisle.  It looked like someone filled a super-soaker with liquid shit and just sprayed all down the shelves, creating a brown waterfall about 3 feet tall, ending in a large semi-liquid poop lake, and topped off with a firm shit coil glacier floating regally in the center.  The extraneous splatters wrapped around the whole corner of the end-cap.  So many dainty beauty products, little tubes of lip gloss and smooth discs of powder and tiny brushes and mirrors, small treasures I lusted over and would collect with the odds and ends of every paycheck, now liberally coated in a dripping layer of human feces.  

At this time, about 6 employees, included the manager and assistant manager, all just stood in silent reverence, no one knowing exactly what to do or say.

At this time, the lowly floor peons all shuffled around to one side, and looked expectantly at the manager and assistant manager.  They weren't the worst bosses, but the certainly weren't the best, and each had histories of stirring the pot, playing favorites, and general retail-boss unfairness. 

""This is a biohazard.  This is not in our job description.  I'll help take apart the end-cap and file damage reports, but I'm not touching shit.  I am not paid enough to touch shit.""  Said one of the brave floor peons.  We stood behind her in solidarity.  

The manager and assistant manager looked at each other.  We were all quite queasy and pale in the face due to the stench at this point, and the store still had several hours before we could close.  So they had us block off the area with all the wet-floor signs in the store, and put us all out to redirect the curious onlookers and onsmellers that began rubber-necking at the scene of the Code Brown.

Then, we got to watch on as our prim assistant manager, with her impeccable tan and expensive hair extensions, and our manager, mister big tough guy himself, snap on some giant rubber gloves, grab tens of rolls of paper towel, many large trash bags, and a few plastic dust pans, and begin scooping the shit by the dust pan-full into the bags.  They were gagging and dry-heaving so hard I could see tiny veins exploding in the whites of their eyes.  

After 2 hours of clean up, and throwing away hundreds of dollars of make up and shelving, we had a store meeting.  Which consisted of all 10 closing employees sitting in silence, staring at the ground for half an hour. 

Several people threw up.  We never found out who the Code Brown assailant was, after our assets protection guy spent hours pouring over the security camera footage.  Justice has never been served.",Code Brown.,803,talesFromRetail
jorcoga,133,,129,1ko00s,,684,"A couple of weeks ago I was working on the drive thru taking orders whilst an African girl charged cars and handed out orders. A car comes through and it's a painful Eastern European lady who is a regular-ish (maybe once every couple of weeks but that's more than enough for her to be ingrained into our minds) customer who has a reputation for ordering things that we've either taken off the menu months/years ago (we did a burger with pineapple for two weeks in January and I still get probably one person a week demanding to know why we don't do it anymore) or things that our competition sells but not us (people get really, really, really indignant if you can't conjure an apple pie).

My brother-in-law (BIL) is working over the summer at a major amusement park.  He works on a water ride that most big theme parks have, where there is a circular boat which sits about 8 people, and there are rapids and waterfalls that get people in the boat wet.  My wife and I decide to visit him at the park one day, and we walk with him as he clocks in for his shift.

A few hours after going on rides, we happen to be walking past his ride and see him standing at the beginning of the line, with jerkface (JF) talking to him very sternly.  At first, my wife and I are laughing to each other, watching how my 18 year old BIL deals with an angry customer.  As they talk, I realize that BIL was the guy in front of the line making sure all of the kids are tall enough to ride.  BIL told JF's kid that he was too short, and JF doesn't realize that people shrink as the day goes on.  JF moves from stern to freaking the hell out, flicking off BIL and screaming ""F--- you"" along with a few other members of JF's family.  

I want to go over there and beat the shit out of JF, but my wife talks me out of it.  Eventually, BIL's supervisor comes, re-checks the kid's height, and says again that he is too short.  JF and his family walk away pissed off, and my wife and I left the park because both of us feel pretty awful watching BIL get yelled at.

An hour later, BIL had been relieved of his height checking duties, but told his replacement about JF.  JF and his family all come back to the ride, and the whole family (about 5 of them) take off their socks, giving it to JF's kid to make him taller.  The replacement sees this, and immediately calls security.  Trying to fake someone's height is considered child endangerment, so security comes and escorts the whole family out of the park.  As they were leaving, JF screamed about the thousands he spent to come to this amusement park, and how poorly he was treated.

BIL was ticked off originally, but extremely happy when he found out about the dude was kicked out.

Like_u_Care,103,,152,1i5dtw,,677,"So two quick stories from when I worked as a video game slave back a few years ago.

**The Shuffle**
In one of the stores I used to work in we would sit behind the counter and watch people come up to the door and do what we liked to call the ""are they open?"" shuffle. (done to the beat of ""We will rock you"") 
March up to the door, pull twice, cup hands around eyes and lean in to see through the glass, (wonder why the lights are off) pull on door twice, lean over and see operating times,(it should be closed... but I""M here so they must be willing to make and exception) pull on door twice, look up at open sign (clearly not on) above door. pull on dor twice, knock and call ""HELLOOOO!"" Pull on door handle two final times, wander away mumbling obscenities while we all sat and stared in awe until Either me or my manager would ask, ""WHY do these people exist?""

**I""M SPECIAL**
One night back when i was a third key, I had been working at a store for a few months that was very prone to robberies (read: five times within as many months) so we closed an hour earlier than most of the other stores i nthe district, and had live monitoring from a security company that checked in with us over intercom every hour and could tap into our camera feed if we had an issue (which  has some fun stories all on it's own)

So one night we are closed, I'm counting down the tills and my two GA's are recovering the walls etc whe n I hear a knock on the window, sounds like metal on glass.

For a few heartbeats I think... That's gonna be a guy tapping his gun on the glass and I'm about to get robbed again... FUCK. But I glance up and it's a man in plain clothes tapping a police badge on the glass right next to our operating hours sign (right next to the door)

One of my GA's heads over towards the door and I call him back ""dude, I've got money out on the counter and we've been closed for a half hour!""

""yeah... but it's a cop....""
""I don't care if it's the pope man we DO NOT open the doors after hours, approach the doors till we have the gates locked and the alarm on, or let ANYONE in the store with money out"" (rules we have all discussed many times bc of the afre mentioned robberies)

So I make eye contact with the cop (or maybe imposter, how do i know?) and shake my head while hollering we are closed sorry blah blah. He continues to tap his badge on the glass and shouts ""I'm a cop!"" I just look back down continue counting and eventually my GA tells me he left and we close up and go home for the night.

The next day I had to open (shitty schedules) and my ASM and I are working on distro, I have my back turned and I hear someone come in, as we turn to greet him sure enough, it's the cop from last night. awesome.

He sees me and smirks to himself, makes a bee line right for my ASM and once again pulls out his badge and sets it on the counter this time while sneering out, ""I am a cop, I came here last nigth to get a game for my nephew and this jerk wouldn't let me in"" 

My ASM, who i kind of based my Management techniques on once I became a SM doesn't even look at me and goes ""well if he didn't I bet you there is a reason, because I know my staff doesn their job right"" and the cop says ""yeah I know you guys were closed, but I'm a *cop* so it's not like I was gonna steal anything"" 

My ASM and I both kind of grin, and he and I both rattle off in tandem with one another 
ASM ""it doesn't matter if your the pope""
Me ""we don't let anyone in""
ASM ""once those doors close""

after a few more minutes of going back and forth about it he finally picks his badge up off the counter, buys his game and leaves, all the while you can see on his face he was expecting me to get fired on the spot for denying him access to the store when we were not even open.

ignacioruiz22,91,,158,1ot594,,671,"First of all, i must apologize for any mistake (English is not my first language) and, second, i don´t work in retail but this story happened to me in a large store in Spain. 

**Background:** here in Spain there is a large company that sells pcs, games and everything refered to technology and it´s employees wear red shirts. They are like Polo shirts and with the company logo like the brand of the shirt (this is important).

**Story:** In college, the day before i had to present an assignment, my printer decided to finish its ink cartridges so i had to go to get some ink at this store.

Now, i´ve always been a football fan so i was wearing a tshirt from the Liverpool team. For those who don´t know how it is, picture a red sport tshirt with a large shield-like logo above the heart and a VERY large beer company logo on the front in white.

Well, here i am, ducking in front of the cartridges isle to get mine (they where at the bottom shelf) when a 40-50y woman comes to me and asks: ""Hey, could you tell me where could i get randomobjectidontremember?"". (I understand that being my tshirt the same colour as the store´s she could possibly be confused as she only saw my behind). I got up and answered: ""Sorry madam, but i don´t work here"". I even managed to point at the beer logo and the Liverpool´s logo but, here she comes: ""Don´t be rude, of course you do. Your shirt is red, isn´t it? So you work here then.""

Now, i am a very expresive man and my face shows what i´m thinking more often than it should, specially when dealing with stupidity so my sacarstic grin came up and, with that smile, i said: ""Sorry but no, do you think that an employee would wear a tshirt advertising an alcoholic drink and a football team?"" 

And then, people imagination bursted: ""You must be a company´s experiment to get more money. So, where is this product?"". I got angry at that point and said: ""For the last time, madam: I DON´T WORK HERE!"".

She just gave me a long look and said: ""Soooo, where is it?"" I sent here to the opposite part of the store.


PD: when i was checking and going out of the store, i saw her speaking angrily with what it seemed a manager and then she saw me, so i waved her goodbye. Her face went blank so i figure she realised the truth finally XD

sneakerpimp87,52,,107,12cjon,,671,"I had a coupon from my favourite clothing store that said ""50$ off your purchase"" and then in smaller writing, but still very plain to see, it said ""50$ off purchase if value of merchandise is 100$ or more before tax.  Not applicable on sales items"" or something along the line.  So, easy enough to figure out.  Get regularly priced items and as long as it comes to 100$ or more before tax, I get 50$ off.  Sweet deal.

I get to the store and they're having a sale.  All their already marked down clearance stuff is half off.  Also sweet.  I try a bunch of stuff on, including the jeans, sold at regular price, that I knew I wanted before I came in.   Each pair is 59.99$, and they're my favourite style and fit, so I picked up two pairs and I selected a few other items from the clearance rack.  (7.50$ for a pair of last season's capris, woot.)

Get to the cash register, put my merchandise on the table there, exchange pleasantries with the cashier.  I hadn't noticed that my jeans were on the bottom of the pile and all the clearance stuff was on top.  Clearance stuff was marked with a red tag.  I hand her my coupon, and as she looks at my pile, she gets this terrified look on her face.  I immediately realise what she's about to say, and go ""Oh!  Sorry!  I have two regularly priced jeans in this pile!  I should have put them on top.""

""You...you read the coupon?""

""Yeah, I know it's not applicable to sales items.  I always read the fine print.  I know most people don't.""

""Oh, thank God, I've so many people get mad at me because they didn't understand the promo...""

""Trust me, I know.""


It was the look of utter terror on her face before I said anything that got me though.  You could almost see her bracing herself for the verbal abuse she was expecting to get.

sallicee,105,,191,1joh1c,,676," Hello! This story is from when I worked at a high street shoe shop in the north of England.  The shoes were fairly high end (up to around £150 a pair) so the sales were always really popular.
During one sale period, a woman in her 50s came in with her daughter and her husband. I greeted them at the door and they seemed friendly, except the husband who kind of grunted at me. I did feel a bit sorry for him being dragged round the sales. The woman picked up a shoe and said to her daughter 'I've been looking at these for so long, I can't believe they're in the sale'. She turned to me to ask if we had them in a size 4. We usually just tell customers that all sale stock is out on the shop floor (which it usually is) but as she seemed so excited, I agreed to look in the stock room. Lo and behold, in the deepest recesses, I found a pair in a size 4. The woman was ecstatic and tried the shoes on. Her husband was sat down silent. She walked up and down the shop while her daughter oohed and ahhed, both of them laughing. She looked again at the price and said 'I can't believe these are such a bargain!'. She turned to her husband and asked him what he thought. Mr Previously Mute suddenly pipes up in a monotone voice 'They make your ankles look fat'. The atmosphere completely changed and the woman boxed up the shoes and handed them back to me, then promptly left. It made me really sad for the rest of the afternoon.

ShaneL79,107,,155,15llri,,666,"While this was not in a retail store, it was just outside as I was leaving. I parked my truck near the back of the lot and was just returning after shopping, just in time to see a small car parking beside my truck. From the distance it looked very close, and as I got to my truck I could see that she literally parked within about 2 inches of my drivers side door. 

The woman who owned the car got out just as I got behind her car. Our conversation went like this:

Me: Are you seriously leaving your car like that?

Her: uhhhhhh...

Me: Please move your car so I can get in my truck.

Her: Sorry. (begins walking towards store)

Me: Wooo Wooo Wooo. Get back here and move your car.

Her: Sorry. (continues walking towards store, fortunately forgot her purse and returns to her car).

Me: Why would you park like this? There are three spaces open to your left. 

Her: I'm handicap. (begins walking towards store again).

Me: (despite her walking fine, parking in the furthest spot, and not having a handicap sticker I say) What does that have to do with anything?

By this point she was ignoring me. The problem is I would normally climb in from the passenger side but I just pulled my hamstring at the gym and while I could walk fine, making odd bends and stretches hurt far to much. 

I seen a cop going through the lot and flagged him over. I explained the situation and he was sympathetic and wrote her a ticket and called for a rush tow. Within about 15 minutes a tow truck arrived and took her car. The cop said she would be forced to pay the tow and impound fee's in addition to her parking ticket. The tow truck left the lot and the woman came out just as the cop drove away and I was getting in my truck. 

She was running towards me so for safety sake I stopped (and I wanted to rub it in a little). I rolled down my window and she asked what happened to her car. I answered her question with a question of my own ""what gave you the right to park so close that I could not get in my truck?"". She didn't answer. I explained her car was towed by ""some tow truck"". Now she just needed to figure out which truck. I'll leave the ticket surprise for her to get later. She asked ""what do I do now?"". I told her she should have thought of that before parking like a cunt, then drove off. 

EDIT: I live in Alberta, Canada. Police can enforce both public and private lots. Regardless this lot was public and was located behind the building with equally convenient access as the buildings private lot and is therefore used equally by the customers of these shops.

Meenite,99,,206,1qw8oa,,665,"Backstory:
I work in a small restaurant in the local mall and most days we open up at 10am (all stores/restaurants/etc follow the same time schedule) and since I'm just a cashier/waitress I show up about 9:45 am, change and get to work preparing the serving area and placing out the buffet items that can sit for a while without getting spoiled (pasta, salad, sauces, etc - in coolers/heaters/water-baths of course). The rest of the buffet is prepped and served at 11am (pizza, enchiladas, etc), sometimes a bit earlier. 

On this particular day I had just opened up the front doors and was placing out the display stands with todays lunch and special offers when a guy showed up and walked past me into the restaurant. I said Hi, which was ignored, he just continued. Ah well, everything was done at the entrance, so I went back to the cash register (its just to the right of the buffet) and waited for him to come over since he was busy with looking over the menu on the wall and the food serving area. He comes over almost immediately and he does not look happy.

""Where's the fucking buffet?!""

(What?) ""Well sir, the buffet opens at 11am, it says so on the sign hanging right above it, so its about 45 minutes left before it opens.""

""But I want the buffet right now! Why isn't it prepared yet? There's lot of people in the kitchen, cant they work faster?""

""As I explained, it opens in 45 minutes, if we put the pizzas out there now they might sit for over an hour before anyone shows up for lunch, and thats not particularly appetizing, is it? And some of the other food is not done yet. We want to serve them as fresh as possible at all times. But our whole menu is available and so is the rest of the lunch menu."" 

""But I want the buffet! It opens at 11am?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Well, I'll come back then but I want a discount!""

""What?""

""I want a discount on the buffet because you were unable to serve it to me when I wanted it.""

(Seriously?) ""I'm afraid I can not give you a discount on the buffet, sir, its already a price reduced offer and I can not make any form of discount on them, the cash register even denies it.""

""But I want a compensation for not getting my food! It is very rude to refuse a customer service! Is your boss here?""

""Sir, I am not refusing to serve you food, I am simply explaining that the food is not yet ready and that you are very welcome to come back in 30 or so minutes when its all done.""

JasinNat,126,,245,1gqf1n,,664,"I got a new job at a small cheap items store next to a busy strip center. I'd been working retail for nearly 10 years, and almost every store I've worked at has shut down, I seem to have terrible luck in that regard. Anyways, I have never worked a register, and so the manager puts me on a register assuming I had worked one. I ask for training and he says ""It's not hard, push a few buttons and money comes out. Are you a moron""?

See my manager is 52 years old, and seems to think yelling at everyone from the comforts of his office is what his job is. As I was saying first day there and we were busy, he puts me on a register as we were understaffed that day and only 2 registers were open. I have no idea what I'm doing, and I ask my co-worker, she just shrugs and my manager looks out of his office and says ""Derp, I don't pay you to talk. Talk again and I'll have you written up. Get back to work"". 

Customers start coming in, and I get a long line. I'm struggling to work the register as it's slow and customers are starting to complain. Then I mess up and charge a customer 199.99 for a 19 dollar item. I already made the transaction and can't undo it without a manager permission. The customer goes ballistic, and more people are waiting in line. 

I call my manager over, and he's fuming mad, red as an apple. He shoves me aside, and says ""how fucking hard is this? Working a register is not rocket science. Push a few fucking buttons and presto you're done. Are you mentally retarded""?, the customer is agreeing with him saying ""The quality of your employee is astounding, these people are lazy and stupid. How can you stand them""?, I look over his shoulder, and he's starting to sweat. the customer asks ""hey, what's taking so long?"", and now it's obvious he has no idea what he is doing, he's going through the menus, and finally he breaks down and calls over my co-worker, who shows him what to do.

After 12 minutes of him screwing with the register, he finally can's the transaction and he restarts it, much to his embarrassment. I sit there laughing to myself.  He mumbles to himself, and still manages to screw the transaction up and ends up giving incorrect change back to the customer. he gave 3 back to the customer, when the register said 5. When the customer confronts him about it,my manager denies it. The customer shows him the receipt and my manager turns bright red and looks over to me ""It's her fault, she had distracted me or screwed up the register to display incorrect change"". The customer then says ""With a terrible manager like you running the place, is it any surprise the employees are terrible? I'll be writing a very scathing complaint to corporate"" and then she walked out.

He then looks to me and says ""This is not my fucking job. This is y-your fault obviously. You obviously did something to the register. I don't know what, but, I'll find out. Y-you're lucky I don't fire you on the spot. If you need anything, go ask an employee, not me I'm not your baby-sitter"".

Rolling_Start,164,,119,17tea9,,670,"This subreddit has been entertaining me for a few months now.... thank you all for your great stories. Please excuse my wall of text, as I thought this would be a nice fit here.

I'm no longer in the retail business, but when I was working there I had some fond and not-so-fond moments. This is one of those moments I just remember feeling so good to tell someone 'NO.'

I was working at a great company in the mall that lets you choose your stuffed animal and we stuff it up for you to your specifications. I can honestly say until now this was one of the funnest and most fulfilling jobs I have ever had. To be able to watch a child's face light up with joy as you help them make a new friend is an amazing thing.

We were slammed one particular day, and it was just three of us in the store. The manager was busy with a 10-girl birthday party on the back stuffing machine and keeping them occupied. Our part-timer was on the main stuffer helping customers as they came up and had quite a line forming. My job was to monitor the sales floor and the register, so I walked about and helped customers find clothing, and then would bring them to the register for final purchase.

Cue our main character. Classic trophy wife type in a nautical style suit and high-end sunglasses with shoulder-length bleached blonde hair . She entered our shop and perused the line of flat animals. I'm with a customer, but my associate has a line 7-deep so I look up from my register and give a happy 'welcome to Fluff-A-Pup!' Being ignored I figured it's another window shopper and finish my transaction.

This woman continues looking along the aisle of animals and then grabs an empty skin, and walks up to my associate. She says something but I can't hear it from where I am, but my associate is busy helping a little 5 year old girl and this woman keeps trying to stand in front of the little girl and trying to talk over her. The woman huffs a bit, then walks over to me; I can already see where this is going. I put on my best smile and greet the woman, 


""Hello Is there anything I can do for you today, ma'am?""


""Yes, you can hurry up and stuff this animal.""


 She then proceeds to drop it on the counter in front of me.


""Of course, ma'am, we will be able to stuff it up if you wait in that line over there.""


 I point to my associate, where two other people have joined the line. 


She looks at me in disbelief and starts to tell me in a harsh tone,


""No, that won't do. Do you see this? :flashes Back Amex: I want my animal stuffed now.""


I calmly reply back,


""That's nice, ma'am. I'm glad to see you have a method of payment. Unfortunately I can't stuff anything here, and both of our machines are occupied so you will need to get in line.""


She looks at me like I have literally thrown up on her, and continues to demand that I stuff her animal.


 ""You don't understand what this card is. I DON'T WAIT!"" 


Cue my sweetest customer smile:
""Well today you do, ma'am. Please wait behind the line of children so you can get your toy stuffed. We will make sure to put extra love in it 
for you!""


She threw the animal down on the floor and stormed out. She was so loud my manager was able to hear her from the back of the store; he just gave me a sly smile and continued his party.

Anywho. I worked in the Deli. I sliced meats and cheeses for customers. I was doing my thing, when a woman (who looked like a poster-child for those meth-not-even-once ads) came up and asked for a sample slice of swiss and roast beef.

We always provide a free slice for customers who want to try before they buy. Gave her the two sample slices and ask her if she wants a larger amount. She responds with ""Nope."" and leaves the counter. I shrugged the first time and noticed her over at the bakery (Next door to us).

She is asking the Bakery for a sample roll. And for them to cut it too. They do, not knowing that she has sample meats from us. 

She takes the sample meat and cheese and places it in the roll. She then proceeds to grab the free mayo packets we have. 

Normally I would have just laughed, and shrugged it off. She came in every day for 2 weeks straight before I finally called her on it. I had discussed things with my zone manager and he told me to break the swiss into fourths and cut the slice of beef in fourths. Enter Meth-Lady.

ML: Sample of Swiss and Beef, Please.

RV: Will do. -Slices the beef and cheese. Proceeds to break/cut.-

ML: What are you doing? I want the whole slice.

RV: Ma'am. I've been watching you for two weeks. We've changed our policy on samples, because you've successfully gotten enough samples to equal a pound of each.

ML: Well. How am I supposed to make a sandwich out of that?

RV: That's the point. You can purchase a full pound of each for 5.98 each, get a bag for rolls for 1.24, and a thing of mayo for .99.

ML: Well. I won't have money for smokes then. 

RV: Apologies, ma'am. 

ML: Well. What are you going to do with the rest? 

I smile. Then proceede to go to our meat bucket and drop the rest of the roast beef in the shrink bucket and the cheese in the organics bucket.

K-hole,125,,174,1hsm9t,,664,"As mentioned in the title, I work in a sex store. A sex store in a downtown metropolitan area that is fully stocked to (almost) every customer's wants and desires. We sell dance (stripper) clothes, lingerie, platform shoes, a wide variety of toys, DVD's and have a booth area for customers to either insert bills by the minute for preloaded movies or pay a set price to select a DVD from our stock.


As a shift manager I come in either mid-day or at night, so I get to witness the full array of crazies, drunk, irate, bitchy, or occasionally absolutely awesome customers. Expect me to be posting often.


Today I had a nice selection of irate. 3 stories from a Saturday, so this is going to get long.


I come in the store around mid-day and before the door even shuts behind me the opener (we'll call him Jon) starts telling me about a near assault that happened not even an hour prior.


A customer came in, checked his bag and headed back to the pay booths and came up to turn his change in to 2 dollar bills. About two minutes later he calls for Jon because he claims the machine ate his bills. Jon says, alright, let me grab a dollar and I'll test it out (note: this is a common scam). The ""customer"" starts yelling at Jon, saying that Jon has worked here forever and knows the booths don't work. Jon calmly explains that, yes, sometimes they do malfunction, in which case we happily reimburse the customer, but it's customary to check the booth. At this point the customer starts yelling and becoming increasingly aggressive. Jon quickly heads back to the counter to be next to the cameras, the phone and the giant mag light we have behind the register. The ""customer"" runs up to the side and begins advancing up to the counter while calling Jon a peckerwood (seriously?). Jon grabs the mag light as the ""customer"" is going at him with a large item in his hand. Thankfully we have a slightly crazy cleaner that is in the store for about two hours every day that backs up Jon and the ""customer"" leaves. The slightly crazy cleaner grabs the guys bag from behind the counter, follows him out and throws it at him.


So I get in, hear the story and watch the video of the incident. Alright, it's going to be one of those days.


About 20 minutes later I'm working on processing new inventory and Jon is calming down a little bit. And then there's a bang on the windows. Alright, probably just a dumb kid walking by. NBD. 30 seconds later, BANG. I walk up to the windows and don't really see anyone, go back to my business. BANG. I go outside and there is a 6'3 drunk man with serious crazy eyes holding a brown bag and punching our windows.


""Hey. Stop hitting our windows.""


The 6'3 drunk crazy eye guy turns. ""what's it to you?"" He advances towards me, the slight, 5'2 manager of a sex store who decided to also advance because wtf.


""I work here and stop hitting the fucking windows.""
""Oh, you work here? What the fuck are you going to do?"" So at this point he is essentially standing on top of me and its kind of scary. But also the police station is a block away.


""call the cops for harassment, being drunk and belligerent and possibly assault."" He high tailed it out of there pretty quickly, but apparently he was hanging out in the alley an hour later.


After that everything is going pretty smoothly. Have a nice couple come in, work on my project, eat lunch. And then a dancer walks in with a shoe box. And this is the worst thing ever.


We do not do returns. We only do exchanges for defective items. This does not include shoes as some girls severely abuse their shoes or are only wanting to wear them with a specific outfit on a busy night. The only cases in which we waive the policy is if the customer called within 2 hours of purchase.


The dancer bought a pair of the most expensive boots we have. Black, glittery thigh high platform boots running $120. I was there when she bought them the previous night.


She opens the box and shows me that the heel became detached from the platform and I say I'm sorry, but we are not taking them back. She is mad and I don't care. She yells at me for about ten minutes, telling me she put them on, and went on stage and got on the pole and they broke. And I don't care and repeat the policy. ""call the store manager.""


So I call her and explain the situation, knowing that the answer will be a solid no. The customer is yelling and a couple is staring. I keep saying no and half saying sorry. 


""But they broke. And you're going to put my money back on my card.""
""No. I'm not going to do that. It is clearly posted that we do not do any returns at all, and we don't do exchanges on shoes. We have no proof that you did not dance in them and if you abuse your shoes its not our responsibility.""
""I'm going to file a complaint with the better business bureau. I do this all the time."" And she smirks.


I realize that she's not going anywhere, so I go back to my work and she starts making phone calls. Putting on a nice voice and stating her location. And then she just stands at the counter.


I'm thanking her for saving me a phone call.

As stated earlier the police station is down the street and they get here pretty fast. One of the two officers I've dealt with before, he's a pretty nice guy.


He gives me an ""are you fucking serious look"" and I hope my look conveyed, hey, I wouldn't call you for this.


She explains that we stole from her because we're not refunding her money. I explain that we have a strict no-exchange policy on shoes. 


""is it clearly stated?""
""yes, officer. Above both shoe displays, by the register twice and where you pick up your items""


Both officers stare at her and now she claims she only tried them on. The officer I haven't dealt with before is left to explain that, while it sucks she broke her shoe, we're under no obligation to refund her money as we have a very plainly stated policy and that she has the option to go to a shoe repair shop.


She packs up her shoes in a hurry, adds a few obscenities, and is now in the banned book. Both officers said I handled the situation really well.


Also, I should note that I am probably the most forgiving person in the store with exchanges. However, it looked like she danced in the boots for a night and then tore the heel off. I have never seen a natural, one day heel break like that one.

My co-worker was running front of house, and I was in the back room. Pretty quiet day, and we're just getting on with things. Just after lunch she comes and grabs me .. ""Feral000, can you come and talk to this customer for a minute?""

I head on into the shop, and there's a chirpy woman stood at the counter with a half drunk bottle of fairly expensive organic rum. This is stuff we had stopped selling at least three or four months ago, as it tended to linger on the shelves for ages. She couldn't have bought it recently.

""This rum tastes odd. I'd like a refund please.""

Wha..

Ok, so our shop attracted a wealth of crazies, but that caught me off guard. I can't imagine ever thinking that would be an acceptable thing to do to any establishment. It tastes odd? You drank HALF of it..

""OK .. so, what's up with it?""

""I dunno .. it just tastes wrong. Here, you try some!""

Shit. Really?

""I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate, and besides, I'll take your word for it. The thing is, you've already drunk half of it, and we've not sold that for months. I can't give you a refund.""

""Well, can I just change it for another bottle of something?""

""No. That's actually ridiculous.""

At this point her complete OUTRAGE was bubbling just under the surface. She was indignant, and stubborn. Convinced she was still within her rights to a refund, she demanded to speak to the manager.

At this point, my co-worker was stood off to the side, looking awe-struck at this glorious display of entitlement.

""Well, I'm a director here, we don't have a manager. We're a co-operative. I'm the most senior here today, so I can deal with your problem. Your request is highly unreasonable, and there's really nothing I can do. If you'd have brought it back right away then maybe we could have given you a refund, instead of months later having drunk half of it.""

""I ... I ... I'm going to WRITE A LETTER OF COMPLAINT about YOU. I'm NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.""

I'd never seen this woman before in my life, it's not like she was a regular. As for the letter, well, that'd come straight to me and the other directors, who would certainly laugh it off as ludicrous.

""OK, be my guest. Do you want me to bin that bottle for you?""

""NO. I'LL DRINK IT.""

At which point she stormed out of the shop and slammed the door. Safe to say, we both burst in to incredulous laughter before the door had even shut. Dumbfounded.


TL;DR : Woman gets upset we won't refund her for the drink she drank. Makes threats, storms off. Laughter ensues.

diinomunster,182,,180,1lzdaf,,664,"[Sushi Setup](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1lz9xq/for_every_five_minutes_she_says_add_another_five/)

okay so I wanted to get a little, straight the point, kind of silly post in before I leave the internet for almost a week. Well..outside of my phone.

Okay, so show of hands who here knows that Diino's are allergic to peanuts? Anyone? Well, that's fine. This Diino is very allergic to peanuts; can't touch them, can't eat them, can't go into a Texas Roadhouse because the peanut dust in the air sends me out on a gurney (no joke. it happened).

So around nine o'clock or whenever the sit in customers kind of wind down, David (the sushi chef) will actually make a really nice authentic Chinese dish for dinner and I'll munch while doing some cleaning chores or in between tables because that's really all we've eaten all day at that point.

B (the owner) doesn't keep anything peanut in the store because of how severe my allergy is and she doesn't want to have to tell a new chef each time that I'll fall over dead in like thirty minutes flat. But tonight David had brought peanuts from home and I didn't know and David didn't know about my situation I guess.

I have two tables, one is a group of college guys just drinking and eating sushi and not really needing me to heavily and another is a middle aged couple that I had just sat down before my food was put on my station. I get the couple's drinks to them, explain our menu and leave them to their browsing while I go steal a few bites. 

Now since I don't eat peanuts regularly I don't really know the taste of them when they're prepped in a soup dish like what David made. So I had about half the bowl before I noticed a little peanut chunk on my spoon. Then holy hell broke loose. I don't have medical insurance which means TA-DA no Epi pens for this Diino. 

I'm scrambling on the store phone trying to get a hold of B so she can come and I can leave, on my cell phone with 911 telling them to please let the hospital know I'll be arriving any second and this is a seriously bad and also letting David know that he has to watch the tables until B shows up because JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I'M ALLERGIC TO NUTS YOU JACK WAGON! 

David is sitting there confused like ""Allergy? I don't know Allergy?"" Because I'm still in the middle of teaching him English and fuck if I know how to translate that to Mandarin. So I look him dead in the eyes (at this point I'm all fifty shades of blotchy and swollen and my tongue is pretty useless) and go ""Peanuts kill me."" and start to walk out the door.

I had totally forgotten I had tables and just as I grab my bag the middle age woman stands up and goes ""Um. Excuse me. Are you going to take our order any time tonight?""

I am seriously dumbfounded. I feel how big my face is, it itches and burns and is all around horrible and she wants me to take her order?

Diino: I'm sorry ma'am. I'm having an extreme allergic reaction. David can take your order for you.

MAW: That guy can't even speak English. Take our order before you leave. 

Keep in mind her husband looks just ashamed of his wife.

Diino: Ma'am you're literally killing me by keeping me here. David will take your order. 

MAW: You bitch! We know the owner of this dirty little hovel and when she hears about this you'll fired instantly.

At this point one of the college boys stands up and goes. ""Ma'am you need to sit down and shut up or leave."" He then decides I can't drive like this and drives me to the hospital. He even waited until I was released from said hospital and drove me back to the restaurant so I could apologize to B and get my car. He even left me a twenty dollar tip.

Apparently MAW never said a peep to B, whether it was her husband or the other college guys that kept her in check I don't know. But B gave me the next two days off to recuperate and WITH PAY (that never happens)! 

But that's my story on how I almost died on the floor of a sushi restaurant because some lady reeeeeeally wanted some raw salmon.

MrRykler,44,,129,19q6h7,,660,"Background: I work as a bookkeeper at a Texas grocery chain. Today was the Morning bookkeeper shift, which lasts from 5am to 1pm. I finish all my paperwork usually around 8am so the remaining 5 hours I am a guest service supervisor. This is an easy job; I just send cashiers and sackers on break and do Western Union transfers, Money Orders, etc. 

Story: So it was a pretty slow morning and I was really bored just finding ways to stay busy when a customer (maybe 30 years old) asks if he can pay a bill here, already complaining about how he's tried to call Energy Company and they won't pick up the phone or something. I say no problem and begin to start the process. The guy is still talking and says that they turned of his electricity because the bill is over due. Our policy is that we do not process bills within or after 3 days of the due date. I forgot to check the date before agreeing to help him, but policy is policy. So I tell him this, and he flips shit. ""What the fuck am I supposed to do then?"" he almost-screams. I reply with, ""Well, you'll have to try calling Energy Company again."" I hand him his bill and he storms off. No biggie, I've definitely had worse customers.

Fast forward 30 minutes, I'm counting some money that just arrived from the bank, and my cashier who answers the phone says it's a call for service desk. I answer it with my shpeel and he says, ""Yeah I was in there earlier trying to pay a bill and I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted"" I was shocked. I mean, he was *kinda* rude, but like I said, I've definitely had worse. ""I'm not usually that rude,"" he continued. I graciously accepted his apology. The rest of my day went great. Definitely felt good talking to a decent human being who was just frustrated with having no electricity. Thought I'd share with you guys a happy-ending story.

Maevora06,83,,175,1j5j2a,,662,"I worked at a young women's clothing chain. I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes. I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day (Friday night). but company rules said I had to open 2 days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays. Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldn't even see a customer until noon. only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get ""talked to"" by our district manager frequently.

Well one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened (maybe 50-60s, I was 19 at the time). He was a small guy but in good shape. He was quiet but seemed like a sweet older guy. He walked around the store for a while. Bought a top he said was for his wife and left. I didn't think much of it.

 He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two. Over time he became more talkative. We would talk about things off topic a few times. it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days. After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes. Asking if his wife would like certain items. He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc. Didn't think anything of it. Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear (not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lol)

I guess he became comfortable with me over time. One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says ""Ok i have a confession. As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife. Most of it is for me"" I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction. So I go ""Oh ok...well, then this is not a good shirt"" and continue to help him find clothes better suited to him. I could literally see the relief in him. He goes on to tell me that on the weekends him and his wife go out to the drag clubs and he dressed up. They had a ton of fun doing it and how it had breathed life back into their failing marriage and brought them back together. He told me how they went from being on the edge of divorce during his mid life crisis into a couple that couldn't take their hands off each other. it was such a sweet story. He thanked me profusely for being ok with what and who he was. I told him I was proud of him for being himself and I was glad it was something him and his wife could enjoy together. He was so happy because a few other stores shamed him and told him he could not go to their stores. I told him he was always welcome at my store and He bought a few things and left.

The next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff. I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it (I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up). He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area. Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways. 

So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag. He had brought in his wig, his high heels, his spanx and his bra that had fake boobies in it. he wanted to see how things would look in his full get up. He wanted to get there early so there was no chance of someone else coming in to use the fitting room. I loved it. It was so much fun. I actually told him I was jealous because he looked better in the mini skirts than I did lol That day he ended up buying $600 worth of stuff which was our quota and I sold it in one transaction. On top of that we got gift cards if we did transactions over $500 so I ended up making $25 that day :D

He ended up being my best customer that year. He came in almost every Wednesday. The days he brought his whole get up, he would be waiting outside my store at opening with his lil plastic bag. About every other week he would drop sever hundred dollars. Since Tuesday was our main shipment day there was always new stuff for him. I will never forget him. 

When it came time for me to leave he was devastated. i was joining the military and he panicked because he didn't know if he would be able to buy his clothes. Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was. I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her. So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift. I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him (she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way). When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her. I told him to come in and meet her. He reluctantly came in. When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes ""OMG is this him?! Hi I am A***** I am so excited to meet you!"" he kinda looks at me but responds to her. She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff. As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along. I knew he would be in good hands.

He asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him. he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff. The normal life stories and such. He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin. We've lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is. I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him won't have to be ashamed of themselves. So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded &lt;3

Summary: Closed minded people are a-holes and everyone should feel comfortable with who they are.

TheDivineSalM,66,,197,1igy9g,,663,"When our tills crash at work, they take ten minutes to come back online after rebooting. During that time your logon details are tied to the crashed till so you can't get on anywhere else.  During that time all you can do is bag for another cashier or pull forward.

Lightfairy,58,,146,1moyjb,,660,"Had a few questions being asked of my job so before the next story I will give you a bit more background on me and what I do. Yes, I am a woman. A mature one at that. When I first used the word mature here on Reddit my SO came out with,

 'Mature? No you're not! You're a crusty old grandma!' 

Ok, yes, I am a grandma. I am 49 but most people pick me for late 30's  which is kinda flattering I have to say. I am tall and I have long blond hair. 

People have asked if I get hit on a lot when I am working? YES. Heaps. Everything from being asked to go out to coffee, dinner or drinks to straight out being asked by two guys one day if I wanted to be the third in a threesome? 

Do I work alone or with other staff? People have an idea that working in an adult store is unsafe. I work alone for my shifts. Our shop is small and there are 4 staff to cover the 14 shifts a week, which is two shifts per day. Shifts are anything from 6 to 9 hours. I currently work 4 shifts. I do the opening shifts 4 days a week and that consists of two x 7 hour shifts and 2 x 8 hours shifts. As for it being unsafe, well anywhere can be unsafe in my opinion. I have only had two incidents that worried me in any way. One a guy that carried a partially concealed knife into the shop (he left without incident) and another a few weeks ago when an obviously high young man decided to have a picnic in the aisle. He too left without any major incident. That story for another day.

The pay? Got to say here that it is honestly the worst money I have ever worked for. I have worked in a lot of jobs. I am a chef, have run restaurants and have cooked for years. I have worked in retail and done a stint as a photographer. I have worked security. I even did deadly snake and crocodile shows for a few years. Damn good money in that! I got a University degree a few years ago in an Environmentally related field. I was even a phone sex chat operator for a year. I do this job in the shop because I actually love it! I get to meet wildly interesting people and I am working in a part of my city that I love. 

To todays tale. Or yesterday actually. Should add that the shop has been undergoing some renovations this week and the boss/owner has been in and out at all hours.

A young man wandered in late in the afternoon. Has a bit of a look around and approaches my brand new front counter.
 
'Can I help you with anything?'

He replied in a faintly whispery and embarrassed voice in halting English 'You speak slowly please, my English, she not very good'.

'Can ... I ... help .... you ... with ... anything?' Says I.

'I have question. Doctor say masturbation is bad for you. Yes? Is it bad?'

WT Flying F!

My mind does a quick 'Is this guy serious?'. I assess him pretty quickly. I do get guys coming in trying to get their rocks off by talking inappropriately. Happens all the time. This guy is NOT one of them. He is obviously very embarrassed and his question is very genuine. We'll call him MG for Masturbation Guy.

Me 'Where did you hear that?'

MG 'Family, my doctor all tell me it is bad'. 

Me 'Masturbation is not bad. It is a normal, healthy part of anyones life.' I have a thought at this point 'Have you ever been with a woman? I ask. 

'No' he says. 

I look at him and ask 'How old are you?'

'19' he says.

God damn! Here I have a 19 year old male virgin who is scared of masturbation. He must be about to explode!

'Masturbation bad for health?' He asks.

I cannot believe what I am hearing. 'No, masturbation is not bad for health. It is perfectly normal and healthy to masturbate.'

My boss comes in with cans of paints and a stock delivery at this point. Young man looks thoroughly confused and even more embarrassed. He obviously has more to ask but way too embarrassed to do it in front of someone else. 

My boss is a great guy and we get along famously. If he wasn't I would not be doing this job!

I hastily whisper what is going on to my boss behind the counter as the young man looks at a few shop items. I go out to the young guy again and he is looking at the wall of male masturbators. Fleshlights and the like. He is also checking out our sale DVD's. 

He asks me how the Fleshlight is used and I explain it to him. He couldn't be any redder if he tried poor kid! He picks up a sale DVD and decides to buy it and we head back to the counter. He is still looking confused and worried. 

Me 'I have a 30 year old son and I grew up with 2 brothers. Believe me, masturbation is totally normal. Hey, Boss, you were a young man once, have a chat to this young man. Masturbations is normal isn't it?'

Boss 'Hell yeah! Every guy does it. I do it every night before sleep so I can sleep well. Hey, some girls like to watch guys do it and some guys like to watch girls do it. Everyone does it. It is normal!'

By now young MG is starting to smile. 

I ring up MG's DVD and he asks me if I work all the time. I tell him the days I work. He repeats the days to me obviously checking that he got it right. He then gives me a big smile and thanks me. 

As he heads off down the stairs Boss says,

'You made a friend there. He'll be back for sure and I bet he has tons more questions!'

ectopia,100,,177,1j87fz,,657,"I originally posted this in /r/letsnotmeet and someone suggested I should post it here. 

First off, I work at an independent video store in a highly residential, nuclear-family infested neighbourhood. We don't have any porn, but we do have a lot of fancy shmancy Criterion movies and other critically acclaimed international titles that are hard to come by. Most of our customers are regulars, and a lot of them have been coming to our store for 15+ years. I am a petite, girly blonde in my mid-twenties. I love movies, and I love my job - but it doesn't pay extremely well.

This particular encounter happened roughly two years ago. It was during the summer, so a few of my co-workers were on vacation and I had taken as many extra shifts as I possibly could (working somewhere between 30-40 hours a week). My mother lived within short walking distance from the store, so I didn't have a problem taking a few closing shifts at the time. The store is pretty small, so I always ended up closing alone.

This all happened at about 9:30pm, half an hour before closing time. This guy stomps into the store, dressed in baggy black clothing. I remember noticing him because he legit looked like Xzibit. Anyways, he comes in, and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blu-rays. Our shelves aren't very tall, so I can see his head poking through. I go back to work, and fifteen minutes later I realize that we're the only two people left in the store, and that he's still in the exact same spot in the blu-ray section, staring at me. I'm a little startled, but I stare back until he looks away. Closing time is fast approaching so I decide to go talk to him, see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whatever.

When I finally approach him, I immediately notice that he looks like he's about to piss his pants. He looks crazy anxious. His eyes are darting all over the room. I give him my usual speech, tell him I have to lock the door in less than five minutes and offer to help him choose something quickly. He stammers something along the lines of ""oh... i uh.. she's the one who sent me here... she wanted something funny... i never... she's... it won't take me long..."" I notice that he keeps playing with what I assume to be his belt. I can't see what he's doing because of his long baggy t-shirt, but I know he's playing with something at the back of his pants, at waist level. I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon, and that he's planning a hold-up.

I do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter. I have the strength of a wet noodle, so I had no intention of trying to be a hero. I was going to give him everything in the register, but I knew he'd probably be disappointed by how little was in there (no more than 400$). Unfortunately, my boss hadn't deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldn't ask me to open it. Because it isn't actually visible, I figured there was a chance he didn't know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirely.
Finally, he starts walking towards the counter and says he's not going to rent anything. I was doing my best to look busy, all while keeping him in my peripheral. He stopped about a foot in front of the counter, directly in front of me, I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank. I looked at it, expecting to see a gun or a knife. Thankfully, it was just his penis. Just an average, semi-hard penis. I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routine.
The flasher seemed confused by my reaction, and I guess he thought I didn't look at it because he began contorting his body so his dick was in better view, trying to get my attention by saying random shit like ""uh so uhhh I'm leaving? uh, goodnight then?"". So I looked up at him, looked back down at his dick and said ""Yeah, whatever."" He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietly.

I called the cops, but nothing much happened. They had me look at some mugshots, but none of them looked anything like Xzibit. I figured I'd probably never see this guy again, because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didn't get him fully hard. Wrong.
Two months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday. The flasher staggers in, still wearing baggy clothes but this time everything is bright yellow. He comes up to the counter and starts awkwardly trying to chat me up, he points to the red writing on his blindingly yellow baseball cap and says ""Hey Mama, see this? What's it say?"" I totally can't help side-eyeing him as I answer ""Draid?"" he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles ""Yeah girl, that's my name! What's yours?"" I lie and say my name is Deborah ""Do you work here a lot, Deb?""

At this point, I don't feel like playing along anymore so I do my best to sound as tough as I possibly can. ""Why the FUCK do you want to know?"" his smile instantly fades and he begins to stammer, and he proceeds to give me possibly the most absurd explanation I have ever heard ""Oh uh... well uh... y'see... I um I have this TWIN brother and like, he's kind of shady and like, he said he comes here a lot... so uh... if he ever did anything shady in your store um... like, I wouldn't want you to think it was me... cuz I'm not shady... but my TWIN is..."" I think I actually snorted. ""Alright Draid, whatever. I do work here a fair amount and it's possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didn't make much of an impression."" He seemed disappointed by this, shrugged and said ""Oh... Ok... Well uh that's good..."" and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the store.

Once more, I stupidly assumed that would be my last encounter with him. I wanted him to think that he hadn't left an impression on me, since he clearly gets off on shocking people. I thought that by telling him that I didn't remember him, he'd be discouraged. Sadly, he had more of a ""Challenge: Accepted!"" attitude.

I didn't work night shifts for a good six months after this, but when I finally took one as a favour to a co-worker... yeah. Flasher shows up. I was already having a pretty shitty night, so by the time he entered the store I was already in a sour mood.

He walks in wearing his all-black outfit, has a big grin on his face and turns to me and says ""Hey, girl. Remember me?"" I was pissed. I could barely conceal my anger when I answered. ""Why would I?"" he seemed to lose some of his initial confidence and blurted ""oh... guess I got the wrong girl...""

He goes back to the same corner as he did the first time, peeking at me over the shelves from the back of the store. My cheeks were burning with rage. It really pissed me off that this guy kept coming back, that the cops would do pretty much nothing about it since he'd totally have time to run away before they got here, and that my fucking boss STILL hadn't installed security cameras. All he did was give me a ""beatdown stick"" (it's a heavy, wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handle.)

I knew from experience that he'd still be staring at me so I looked up and made eye-contact. I glared at him. Since acting indifferent didn't work, I took a different approach. I wanted to scare the fuck out of him. I yelled at him from across the store ""WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU'RE STARING AT ME. DO YOU NEED HELP? YOU KEEP STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he began to shake his head. ""NO? YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING? YOU SURE? YOU'RE STILL STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he shook his head some more. ""ALRIGHT WELL IF YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING STOP STARING AT ME."" his head shot down.
I pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat. I still wanted to scare him, but I was aware that being a petite little blond girl in a pink sequin dress didn't make me look like much of a threat. So I decided to make myself look like a crazy maniac. Before he came in the store, I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia so I figured I would just pretend to keep my attention on the show, all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it. I started yelling at the screen, like ""HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS"" I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry, and waved the beatdown stick a few times. It took about ten minutes but yeah, he ran out of the store FAST.

So yeah, I haven't seen him since and I really hope I don't either 'cause fuck I am out of ideas now.",and he never offered to pimp my ride :( (long),834,talesFromRetail
Twitchh,113,,127,1ag2xx,,657,"I used to work for a blue shirt electronics store in the cell phone department. After a few years I decided to move on to better opportunities (more money) and put in my two week notice. This occurred about one week into my two week notice. 

It's fifteen minutes after closing and I'm inside the counter area cleaning up and putting away merchandise, general ""I want to go the fuck home"" type activities when this large woman walks up and plops two prepaid phones on the counter without saying a word. I notice her after a few seconds and ask ""would you like to purchase those?"" She sarcastically replies with ""no, I just put them up here to look at."" Fine, I can see how this is gonna go so I just decide to zip my lip and complete the transaction. I get to the total and tell her what she owes and she tosses her credit card on the counter. Now I'm annoyed because she's just being disrespectful. But I again bite my tongue and don't say a word. I finish up the transaction, put her phones and receipt in the bag and hand it to her without saying a word. She snatches the bag out of my hand and says ""you ain't even gonna tell me to have a nice day?! You're rude!"" 
At this point, I lost it. I tried to stay professional throughout and she just went one step too far so I left her have it. I figured I've only got a few days left, what are they gonna do, fire me?
I look at her and let it fly. ""No, I'm not going to tell you to have a nice day. You walk up here fifteen minutes after we close, drop your shit on the counter and give me a smart ass remark when I ask a simple question. Then you have the audacity to toss your credit card at me like I'm your bitch. After all the your expect me to tell you to have a nice day? Nope! I won't. In fact, I hope your day sucks. In fact, I hope you have a crappy weekend. Bye.""

I'll never forget the look of shame/anger on her face. She couldn't even muster up a response, she just huffed away and I went back to work. Apparently she went and found a manager to complain about me because I saw her leave 5 minutes later and the manager on duty came over to ""reprimand me"" for my behavior but as soon as she cleared the exit door he bust out laughing. He told me he saw the while thing and just let it go because she had it coming. She probably thinks she won because I was gone after that week, but at least she'll think twice next time.

Nice old white guy came to the shop with a forklift tire. The valve stem was missing and he wanted to replace it. I told i'd check if we had any more valve stems that would work for this rim, we didn't. He says to put on any old valve stem, he doesn't care if it will last or not, he just needs it to move a forklift to an auction house, but cant until there is air in the tire. 

I put a stem on it, but it is a rubber one, wont last him long, but it will last long enough for him to do what he wants. Asks me how much, tell him its just a little valve stem took me like 2 mins to put in, not to worry about it. Hans me $30 and leaves. 

Story 2
Two arab guys come to the shop, one is dressed in ""normal"" clothes (cant think of another way to say it) the other is wearing those middle eastern gown thingies. They want 4 tires, used ones. Give them a quote of $30 each. They say if I do it for $25 each they can guarantee more business. Im like fuck that I gave you a price. They keep insisting they say ""We go to the nearby mosque, we have many friends there, if you help us we will send them here, we will also bring our family, it will be good for you""

they try to negotiate for like 20 mins before I cave.
best decision ever made. We get tons of people coming in telling us these guys sent them in, and on top of that one of the guys told me ""if you do give us the tires at $25 i'll bring you and your guys a home cooked meal"" I thought he was joking till he came in one day with a big ass feast of Afghan food. I told him I thought he was joking about the food he just said, ""When we make a promise, God becomes angry if we do not keep it, also a Man must keep his promises or he is no man."" 

oh and he brought tortillas with the afghan food because ""I hear Mexicans like to eat with these""

gaitingirl,188,,142,1ixrnx,,653,"I work as a cashier at a fast food restaurant and from time to time I'll have someone come up to the register and try to place their order...and that's not how we work. Our line starts at the opposite end of the counter and people order their food and then pay.

Anywho, we had our dinner rush come in for the night and had a bit of a line going when I have this black woman come up to the register and order a sandwich. Now I know that it's just a sandwich, but I want you to imagine one lane being shut down on the interstate and it's at a stand still because people keep speeding past the slow people to where they can cut in at the front...that's how our cutting block works as the meat person fixes the plates already set before him/her. In my nice happy voice I told the lady ""I'm sorry ma'am, but the line starts back down at the other end.""  She looks at me without saying anything and moves to the beginning of the line and that's that...or so I thought. The lady had gone through the line and ordered her sandwich, when it came time to ring her up I did not expect the words that came out of her mouth.

W: That was rude.
Me: I'm sorry?
W: Telling me to go to the back of the line, that shit ended with Rosa Parks.
Me: *I just stood there dumbfounded for a second* Did you really just call me a racist? You know what, nevermind ma'am you have a good day.

I was furious! I despise being labeled as a racist, and she should have noticed I told a WHITE lady that right before her since she was standing right there the whole time. People can be so damned stupid at times.

deidru,120,,136,1h4cew,,651,"I have to say despite the usual bitching and moaning, I have fairly decent customers. And, this one made me giggle. So  it's late on Monday and we are always dead on Mondays.  I'm working on floor moves when a wild customer appears.  

Lady- ""Hi.  ummm I need to do make an adjustment.""
Me-  ""Sure.  What did you need to adjust?""
Now this is the part where I usually get a receipt, and a customer complains about our price changes/sales.  However, this lady blindsided me.
Lady- ""I was at your A store the other day and bought two pairs of capris.  I returned them both for a different size, but A store didn't have another pair of navy ones, so I got black ones.""
Me- ""Oh? Did they charge you more for the black ones?""

Now, somehow half our capris by one brand went on sale, the rest stayed at full price.  Usually when they do this it's to get rid of the colorful ones and keep the solid colors.  However, not such the case. I assumed the other associate just didn't give her the even exchange.

  Now I look at the receipt and both are already discounted to the sale price.  I stare at the receipts to double check.  I figured maybe they forgot to add the coupon. 

Me- ""Ma'am, these are the right price. They did an even exchange.""
Lady-""No they aren't.  The black pair were 31.98, she only charged me 12.85.""
Blink.  blink
Me- ""Well.  That's okay.  You don't have to worry about it.""
Lady-  ""No.  The girl she was really nice and she didn't have to do it.  I knew they were $31.98.  If I didn't know or I didn't see the receipt, I wouldn't care.  I need to pay the difference.""

Blink Blink.
Me- ""Excuse me?  I don't follow.""

I have to say, this was one of those times where I was honestly bewildered.  I actually had her repeat it.  

Me- ""So you want to pay the $31.98?""
Lady- ""Yes, I feel better if I pay the full price.""
Me- ""Really?  We really don't care.""

Drunken_Black_Belt,177,,232,15q63n,,653,"Hello on and all!  I hope you are all having a wonderful day. I certainly am, seeing as my Redskins won the big game last night (HTTR!).  So, being in a chipper mood, I figure I can share some laughs with everyone here.  Fair warning, if you are sensitive about religious topics, specifically Atheism, this story might not be for you.  So today I bring you:

**Religious Hypocrisy Abound!**

So it's another fine day, working for *Doodoocrombie &amp; Mitch*.  I'm floating between stores, coaching associates, doing my LP thing.  Eventually, I end up at the *Follistar* brand store, and am in the back going over paperwork, investigating money shortages we've been having.  I have the stores camera's up in front of me, and from time to time I am taking sharp, eagle eyed glances at them, to make sure one of the mannequins didn't fall over.  It was dead. It was beyond dead. It was deader than Bambi's mom after hunting season.

Too soon?

Anyways, in walks this family.  A mother pushing a baby stroller, and three sons, ages roughly around 11,14, and 20+.  Nothing really drew my attention to them, but being the only people in the store, I figure I should watch them. The older guy and the 11 year old sit in the chairs in the front of the store, just chilling, while the mom and 14 year old go into the store.  The 14 year old pics out a nice pink and white checkered button up shirt, and a few other flannels.  His mom has him try them on, and after seeing they fit, she points to another room, and he goes walking  off. That's when I see the mother take the 3 shirts, bundle them up, and stuff them under the baby stroller.

Fantastic.

Now the normal downside to this, would be that since I'm watching her on camera, I can't go from the camera room in the back, to the sales floor, without losing sight of the shoplifter.  If that happened, then I technically wouldn't be able to make a stop, as I couldn't 100% testify that they definitely did not ditch the stolen merchandise.  Luckily for me, she happened to be in the room right next to the door that leads to the back room. So I called a manager, and was able to get onto the floor quickly enough to ensure that she didn't ditch the stolen items.  My cover was obviously blown, so I just played the part of a manager, and me and the other manager just walked around, talking about this and that in the store. Meanwhile we discreetly followed to the woman.  Sure enough she leaves the store, and I make my stop.  I identify myself, and ask her to come with me.  Im blocking the exit for strollers, so this woman just says ""No"" and starts trying to push her stroller, with a baby, up the stairs to exit. I'm trying to block her progress, but also don't want to risk injury to the baby.  The older male starts asking me what is going on, and not wanting to embarrass the woman, I just say ""She has some of my merchandise and I need her to pay for it.""  Something about the look in his face told me he was semi aware of what was going on, but not a part of it.  The 14 year old started yelling at me to stop trying to ""hurt his mom"".  I told my manager to call the cops. The woman kept shouting ""I didn't do anything I'm a good christian!"" and pushing the baby stroller, WITH THE BABY IN IT, into my shins and thighs, trying to get past me.

Now, I loved my LP jobs, and I took them seriously, but I would never do anything to risk a child's health. Fuck that, it's not worth it. 

So I calmly said, while walking next to her into the mall, ""Ma'm I'm not gonna stand in your way, because if you're willing to risk your child's health to get away, I'm not going to be a part of that risk. But I don't care if I have to follow you to your car, get your plates, and have the police follow up. I'm getting my merchandise back, and you will have to deal with all that follows.""

She just kept dipping and dodging, trying to walk away and shouting ""GET AWAY I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.""  The older male just kind of follow shaking his head. He was a lot bigger than I was. I'm big, but he was close to 7' tall and had at least 100 lbs on me.  But so far he wasn't threatening. The 14 year old on the other hand, kept trying to run interference.  I would just walk around him, and keep pace with the mom.  

At this point the mother is shouting ""IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'M CALLING THE COPS!"" to which I replied ""I'm already on the phone with the cops.""  I dialed them up and they had my managers call before, and I was detailing to the dispatcher where we were in the mall at that time. Every time I gave a location and direction, the woman would turn and go another way.  It was a game of cat and mouse, wherein the cat couldn't run and the mouse had down syndrome.

Who will win, you ask? Well naturally it was me.  Eventually the 14 year old decided ""Well, I can take him.""  and decided to step in front of me, push me, then take a swing.  NOPE.  So we are on the ground, the woman is screaming, and the older guy is standing over me as I'm holding his brother on the ground.  I tell them to get back.  Luckily the older guy had a cool head on his shoulders, and decided to step between the woman and I and keep her from jumping on me.  Just then the cops arrived, a whole 10 minutes after all of this nonsense began.  The cops cuffed the young boy and led the mother and him back to the store.  

Once inside, we got everyone separated, and began to talk.  The woman is in tears, just saying ""I'm a good person, I'm a good Christian.""  The young kid is staring daggers at me.  The cops ask me if I want to press assault charges.  I look at him, and at the mother. 

I can't tell you why I did what I did. I can only tell you that I am an amazing, kind, (and obviously humble) person. Maybe even the greatest person who ever lived.  I told the cops not to press charges.  That he thought I was harassing his mom, and when he stepped in front of me, we ran into each other, and I took it as a hands on thing when he pushed. I didn't tell them about the punch.  I think the cops knew, but realized I didn't want to put this poor kid through a trial when he was defending his mom.  Yes I am an amazing person with a trivial act of kindness. That means more Karma, right Reddit?  Upvote me damnit!

Ok enough sarcasm.  We recover the shirts from the baby stroller, and have the older male take the baby and the 14 year old outside to wait.    The mother has calmed down enough, and keeps saying thank you. Thank you.  We start to question her, and she explains that tomorrow is picture day at school, and her older son is the only one who works in the family. So they are struggling. She wanted her boy to have nice clothes, and this is the only way to get them right now.  She looks at me and says

""Good"" Christian Woman:  Thank you for not pressing charges on my son. He was just protecting me. They don't know I do this. Im ashamed.  But thank you for understanding and not making problems for him.  Please tell me what Church you go to, and I'll gladly make a donation as a thank you.

Me:  I understand. He just thought I was harassing you for no reason. Any good son would have done the same. But save your money Ma'm.  You obviously need it, and besides, I'm an Atheist, so there's no church to donate too.  But it's a sweet sentiment.

Now I don't think that I have the words to properly convey the look that came across this woman's face. It was some sort of mixture between confusion, disgust, revulsion, and incomprehension.  It honestly looked like I had just told her that if you kick a puppy through a field goal post, you'll find a pot of gold where it lands.  

Yes that is an awful image, and I love dogs, but imagine the look on your face if someone told you that in all seriousness, and that's how this woman looked. 

GCW: An....Atheist?  But you're obviously a good person. You were kind to my son.  How are you not Christian?

M: Well, that's a whole debate about whether you need religion to be moral, but...

GCW: You do. You can't be moral without God.  

M: Ma'm I'm not going to get into a philosophical debate here.  

GCW: But your godless.  You're false.  

M: False?  Like I don't exist? I'm afraid I don't follow.

GCW: That's why I came in here.  Satan was working through you and I fell for his tricks and stole.

M:.....

GCW: How can you trust Satan?

M: Ma'm I don't believe in Satan.  It kinda goes with the whole Atheist thing.

Now this was even more shocking to hear for her.  I guess she assumed that all atheist were devil worshipers, because logic?  Meanwhile the cop is sitting there just kinda of watching this.  I keep trying to get out of the situation, but she keeps wanting to refocus on ""saving"" me.

GCW:  I can help you.  If you let me just help you. Read the bible. I have so many I can give you one! Just open up to it.

M: Ma'm for the last time, I don't want to discuss this.  I have read the Bible, I have read several books of the Apocrypha, I've read the Quran, Book of Mormon, Dhammapadda, and parts of several other religious texts from various religions and belief systems.  It's not an issue of ignorance.  But that is not why we are here. We are almost done if you just let us finish our paperwork, the officer here is going to release you on a PTA and you'll be free to go.

GCW: YOU NEED JESUS

And that's when I snapped.  I can tolerate religious talk, and honestly, even enjoy open discussions about various faiths and beliefs.  But a man, can only take so much.

M: Well, if I WAS going to take religious guidance, I probably wouldn't take it from someone who can't even follow one of the top 10 rules of their religion. 

I decided to accent this point by holding up the shirts she had just stolen.  Hypocrite.

GWC decided this was a good point to shut up and start scowling at me.  The officer shot me a look and we continued our paperwork, before walking her out.  The officer was gonna walk with them and escort them off the property.  The GWC, and her two younger sons were glaring at me the whole time, like I had just literally punt kicked a puppy over a field goal post.  The older son looked upset, but was still very quiet, other than saying ""Sorry about this"".  GCW packed up the carriage and said ""Come on boys. Before this false man perverts us even more.""

Naturally I just said ""Have a good day!""

**TL;DR- Matthew 7:1-5 *Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.*  Guess she didn't read that part**

After I tend the transaction, she told me that she tries to do this every year, and that she would try her hardest to do it even in bad times. (at this point, I was filled with awe as I had never seen anyone in store do anything as selfless as this). She asks where the backpacks are, I tell her.

A few minutes later, she returns with two backpacks, one for a girl and one for a boy. ""I really wish I could see the look on their cute little faces when they see these."" Since she had depleted her cash in the first transaction, she paid this with a couple gift cards (that she had been saving for the past year). She grabbed her receipt and quietly walked out of the store, leaving everything on the counter..

vlnplyr5,221,,134,1bqlpk,,646,"Hello TFR!  Several years back I worked at a grocery store, which now has been forced to close many of its stores.  At the time, I worked at the customer service counter where we cashed checks, did money orders, sold cigarettes, videos, and other goods, etc.  I'd dealt with my fair share of fake bills, scam artists, etc., but the worst experience I had came from a co-worker.

The store had recently hired on a loss-prevention lady since our theft was a bit out of control due to the neighborhood where the store was situated.  Well, after a couple months, speaking to her in passing, etc., she came in on her day off to collect her paycheck.  She patiently waited in line so she could cash it, and I commented that she looked very incognito that day, due to her coming to work in street clothes on her day off.  I cash her check, and away she goes.

Probably 20 minutes later, I'm called by the store director to come to his office.  I have someone cover for me, and away I go, having no clue why I'm being summoned.  I walk in, and there's my store director at his desk, with the loss-prevention girl sitting across from him, along with another empty chair next to her.  ""Have a seat,"" he says.

I sit down thinking, oh crap, they think I stole something.  The store director opens with the usual political crap about something we need to discuss.  He turns it over to her so she can make her statement.  She says that while I was cashing her check, I said something about ""incog-negro"", or something of the sort.  I was FURIOUS!  I quickly stood up and started toward the door, completely disgusted with, not only the situation, but that I would be accused of something like that.  You see, not only was the loss-prevention lady black, but the store director was too!!!

He stopped me before I got to the door and basically said, ""If you leave, I can't help you.""  In my rage, I turned around and looked right at her and said, ""I said INCOGNITO!  How can you not know what that means??  Get a dictionary or something!!""  I then looked at the store director and told him that I couldn't believe what was happening, and that I had ALWAYS treated him with respect and that we had a great working relationship.

After that, he asked her to leave the room and told me that she had already made several other accusations against people in the store.  She was let go a couple months later for failing to produce any sort of change as it related to theft.

sielix,88,,163,1biy23,,645,"Edit: Hey guys thanks for the great response! I have a ton of stories to share. I thought I'd also share this little tidbit. I posted on College Humor last year about my encounter with the law, it's now in their hall of fame! Here's a link: http://www.collegehumor.com/upick/6699627/pizza-fought-the-law

Edit 2: Front Page! Thanks everyone!

I used to work for a food company that would go to special events and cater. We are very popular in our province, so we get booked to a lot of shows. 

It was last summer and my pizza company was hired to serve free pizza for a huge union party that had over 10k people. Now I was a manager and I had 20 staff, spent at least 3 hours prepping ahead of time because we knew we would get rocked.

Gates open, and we already have a lineup. Let me also add there was also a burger place, hotdogs, chinese food, bakery stuff and all this other delicious food. We were the only ones who had a lineup for free pizza for the entire day.

So, it's hot. We are tired because you know some people take forever to choose between the only two options of cheese or pepperoni. We start to notice that we are actually going to run out of food within opening the first 5 hours. We were supposed to be open for at least 9 hours. We also had enough food for the expected 10k guests, but turns out the people that hired us had lied and there was more than that. This was also supposed to be a 2 day event by the way, so big hiccup.

We were given the OK to close the tent early, but there was still a huge line of 100 people and once we start telling them we're almost out of food they all rush in front of the counters just to grab a slice. It was complete madness. 

So we are finally out of pizza, but still had a lineup despite telling these people an hour before that we would be closing once it's out. Then the rage begins. An annoying customer starts shouting at us to give her pizza. She begins swearing to one of my servers, and then I confront her.

Me: ""Ma'am you need to calm down. You have no right to talk to my server like that.""

Rude Woman: ""I want my pizza, you can't do this! I waited in line for an hour, my children are starving! What the fuck are you guys doing?! Blah blah rude rude"" 

Me: ""We said we were almost out of pizza an hour ago, and besides the pizza is FREE. You aren't paying for it. There are 5 other food places right beside us with NO LINE. Pizza is not the only food here.""

Rude Woman: *Starts swearing at us*

Customer beside the rude woman: ""Hey bitch shut the fuck up! Go to fucking hell! You can't talk to them like that what's wrong with you, you rude fat bitch!""

The two then almost get into a damn brawl, but I was so glad this customer stood up for us. I was about to lose my shit as well, but it was such a sigh of relief. Some customers are just awesome. I gave her some pop for her and her kids since we had no more pizza. While the two fought we just closed our tent up and had to disperse the horrid crowd.

j_guazu,97,,177,1raji3,,648,"I work in customer service at our country's state-owned electricity company. Yesterday was one of days when the technicians go around disconnecting anyone who owes over three months of bills, and I had the joy of being one of the reconnections desks dealing with the hundreds of pissed off people that had been cut off. There were a lot of idiots among them, but one guy really stood out. He came up to my window, told me his power was shut off and that he couldn't find the bills to bring with him.

Me: No problem, do you have your meter number?

Him: No.

Me: Ok then, what's your address?

Him: Two blocks from the San Miguel church on route 2, the road with the petrol station.

Me: I need to know the name of the road and the house number.

Him: Well most people call it *random nickname related to the petrol station*.

Me: But what does the city call it?

Him: It's 'Sargeant something'.

Me: Yeah, I can't do anything unless I have the bill, the meter number or the address. Could you go and call someone at the house, have them tell you the meter number and then re-join the queue?

He wasn't pleased about having to queue all over again, but went off to call whoever. Eventually he works his way back down the line, reappears at my window and reads the number off his phone:

Him: It's 1754 and the last number is either 2 or 3.

Me: What?

Him: She says the wheel for the last number is turned halfway between 2 and 3.

Me: That's not the meter number. That's the number that tells you how much electricity you've used. The meter number is nine digits and it's on the grey sticker underneath where it says ""meter number"".

I got an evil-glare from him as he went off to find out the actual number and queue for a third time. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him on his final visit to the windows, but my colleague did. He managed to get the correct number and pay what he owed, but got angry when she told him his power would be back ""within 24 hours"". He snapped at her that he had eight chickens in the fridge that were all going to go bad if he wasn't reconnected immediately, and that he's going to write a formal complaint to the company about both of us and to demand some kind of recompense for the chickens.

A man and a woman about my age (mid-twenties) came in and ordered a coffee and a soda to go (and paid for them) while browsing the menu. They decided the menu didn't have what they were looking for (its ok, it happens) and begin to inquire about the ""grab and go"" type snacks and desserts up front in the case.

**Me** ""I.. uh... I'm not, the state is... you just paid the tax for your coffee and soda... did you not want the chips then?""

""YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WORK VERY HARD FOR THEIR MONEY!!!""

allyourbasekris,63,,112,19h7zl,,651,"So I used to be an assistant manager in a computer game retailer in the UK. Our policy at the time was exchange or gift card only on PC titles but we'd refund or exchange unopened console games for cash. We also had a points scheme that would mail out vouchers to our loyalty card holders (this is important).

So, it transpired that our store and several other of our stores in the area were getting hit by a group of scammers who'd buy a console game, remove the shrinkwrapping, steal the game out of the box and then re-wrap the game with a shrinkwrapper using padding of some sort to make the game feel like the correct weight.

They always used to hit stores at the busiest times and always had a receipt so management used to authorise these without any further thought to actually checking if the game was actually in the case (Stupid I know).

So after losing several games in our store to this scam, we were being a bit more wary of returns, especially shrinkwrapped games coming in at busy times, so we had a customer come in with a copy of GTA IV which had only been released a few days earlier wanting a refund, it was insanely busy so the manager took it in without checking on behalf of one of our new staff, refunds the customer and thinks nothing of it.

Well, it turned out that we'd been caught out again with the scam. The  case had no game in it, but the thief being a total genius had stuffed it with one of our loyalty card letters we send out, probably trying to be clever.

He wasn't that clever though, the big problem with using our literature for this is that not only did it have his loyalty card number at the top of the letter, IT ALSO HAD HIS FULL NAME AND ADDRESS written on the top.

Apparently corporate took him to court over this and the lad couldn't understand how he'd been caught out.",Shrinkwrap Scam Fail!,763,talesFromRetail
WorriedWorm,196,,292,1iwe9t,,644,"I just up and quit. I had tried everything, I have talked to corporate, I had proof and nothing was done. 

I got the job when I was 16, the manager who hired me was my mentor, he served as a father figure in my life. I worked hard for years, getting promotions and pleasing the customers. Our store was run well, the store manager was a reasonable man and was best friends with the mens department manager (my manager), the employees here were intelligent and fun to be around. We were the highest selling store in our state. It was a magical place to work, I loved every minute of it.

A year ago I was offered a promotion to manager. Housewares needed a new manager, and I was the one they wanted to run the Department. For the longest time I was a Supervisor I was the young, reasonable guy everyone loved. Being offered the promotion was the happiest day of my life, no joke. I was overwhelmed and had a lot of anxiety over this, but, everything worked out.

As manager I began noticing how different management was to being a lowly worker. Lot of drama, and the worst corruption. I noticed one day as I was talking to the textiles manager as he was ringing someone out, he was giving that person a massive discount. What? That can't be right. 70% off? The item was 30% off. I confront him, and he plays dumb saying it was a mistake. I believe him, I do, because I trust the people working here. But, I'm still suspicious. The next day I'm returning something to textiles when i see him again with the same customer giving him a massive discount.

I confront him again. He just shrugs, and tells me ""Does it really matter? Just another perk of being manager"". I go up to Rick our Store manager, and tell him what I saw, I show him proof, and he just sighs and leans forward and tells me ""A manager is allowed to give out discounts. You didn't know? That's fine, but, if you wanna hand out discounts don't make it so obvious"". I sit there my mouth agape, looking at him like he lost his mind. ""sir"" I say ""Sir, that's against corporate policy isn't it?"", he looks at me and his eyes narrow ""If you want to keep your job here, don't think so hard about this"".

I storm out and go to find Alan. Alan was the one who hired me, he is my mentor and like a father to me, he was the smartest man i knew, the hardest working a real stand up guy, he would know what to do. I go to his office. He looks up from his computer, ""hey Dean, what's going on? Need something?"", so i calmly explain what i saw and heard. Alan sighs, and motions for me to sit. ""It's best if you ignore this. I don't much agree with this, but, the right thing to do is to mind your own business. If Rick says it's okay, then it's okay. Now you've done a darn fine job here. Don't ruin your career here"". I'm stunned, the Alan i knew would never say this to me, the Alan I knew would never turn a blind eye to these shady dealings. There's no feeling quite like knowing the guy you idolized turns out to be just as bad as the rest. I went home early that day, I needed to decide what to do.

I decided to not do anything, yet. Days went by and I got the distinct feeling I was not very wanted here.The aura in that store had changed. Managers would glare at me, and I just felt unwanted. But I trucked on, there was nothing to do. About a couple weeks ago, I was returning a shirt to womens when i caught a new hire, Tamara removing the tags from a blouse and placing the item into a bag without paying. I confronted her, and she denied everything, but, I saw and dragged her to my office. 

I was giving her a lecture preparing to fire her, when the door opened and the womens dresses manager, Amy barged in and claimed she would handle this. I think ok, it's her employee and a a close friend of hers, she'll handle this. I go back to my department. I then see Tamara coming out of the office's and heading back to her department. She wasn't fired. I go to Ricks office, and ask him whats going on, Rick ""She had a minor lapse in judgement. Everything has been fixed, no harm done. It's over and done with"" he harshly explained. Again, I was wrong about this store, i was wrong about everything.

That night at closing I was taking the trash out when I was closing, mostly everyone had gone home, and I had just finished my cash drops, I was walking out when I saw Alan in the womens department taking the sec-tags off the items and putting them in a bag. He must have a dozen shirts in there, he hadn't paid. I followed him out the store, and there was a car waiting.

Alans wife was in said car. She spotted me and waved, Alan, turned around and came up to me. I was the first to speak ""You didn't pay for those clothes, did you?"", and so Alan looks at me,looks me dead in the eye and says ""No. But, I can and will pay at later date. There was no harm done"" I grow red ""No harm done? This is against the policy, this is theft pure and simple. I have to report this"", he puts hs hand on my shoulder ""Son, I got you this job, and with 1 word I can get you fired. We going to have a problem?"", and then he walked off and got into her car and left. 

That was the final straw. I felt so betrayed by Alan, and this store. How could they be this blatant about their stealing? I had proof they were, so the next day i went to LP. The LP manager, Arnold was not the most pleasant of people to be around, he was egoistical and not very good at his job, his LP agents weren't much better. I tell him what I saw, and ask if he can replay the videos. Gotcha!Arnold looks over to me, and tells me ""So ole'Alan is stealing, eh? Who cares, you aren't going to use me as a witness because I trust ole'Alan, he's a good man. Corporate will not care, and your job is on the line. Just sayin"", I ignore him and walk out. 

During break I contact corporate, I contact the Regional Manager, and to my surprise he is willing to do an investigation. The next day I'm called into Ricks office, sitting in Ricks chair is a man in a suit I had never seen before, RM, had to be and in front of him Alan. The man introduces himself as Todd and says he was contacted here by a concerned manager that we had a theft problem. I explained to him what I saw, and what had been going on. Todd, asked Alan, and Alan defends himself and then finally deflects this onto me, and attacks my character.

Todd smiles and says he think he sees the issue here, he says he's looked around and thinks the issue is I'm not able to do my job. he recommends that I not be placed in any leadership position. He gets up and shakes our hands. Rick is furious, and Alan is smiling. Rick looks down at me, ""Should have minded your business. I should fire you, but, I won't because truth be told you're a valuable employee, but, your time as a manager is over"" he boasted. I get up and walk out, Rick yells at me, I tell him all that needs to be said ""I'm done. I quit"". As I'm walking out Alan grabs my shoulder, ""Son, rethink what you just said. You spent 11 years here,you aren't going to be able to use us as a reference. Think about what you're doing"", nope, I don't care. I throw my badge on the ground and walk out the front door.

HerdaGurda,185,,213,1h3n39,,650,"I am not allowed to make executive decisions at my store, since I'm not a manager. This includes kicking people out, doing exchanges and refunds, and dealing with irate customers. I'm alright with this, though, because I just need to tell kids to stop screwing around in the store. 

Anyways. I was at work earlier this evening when 3 young boys came in - I’d say 9 - 11 years old. My coworker and I were keeping an eye on them because it’s retail and the little brats like to steal things. 

The store I work at isn’t exactly kid-friendly. There are a lot of risque items as well as items with vulgar language on them. Our card rack capitalizes on both these aspects quite well. One of the cards we sell is a birthday card with a woman holding a chalkboard so as to cover her insinuated nude breasts and genitalia; the chalkboard reads: 
&gt;Menu:

&gt;*  Large, juicy melons 

&gt;* Smokin’ hot buns 

&gt;* Whipped cream for dessert.

The boys glanced over the card to pick up a mug covered in various curse words, with one laughing and pointing at the smallest of the three as he proclaimed, “These all describe you! You’re a fuckin’ faggot bitch! Ahahahahahahaha!”

At this point, my coworker looks at me with this look of “Are you kidding me?”

They returned to the aforementioned card, picked it up, and the same boy who spoke said (quite loudly), “This bitch deserves what’s coming to her. Slut.”

They then wandered around the womens’ clothing section for a bit, picking up the less modest clothing and making remarks such as, “Yeah, she’s begging for the D if she wears this.” “God, anyone who wore this would open their legs for anything!” etc.

They soon left, only to return an hour later, running through the store. Apparently, they were playing keep-away with the smallest boy’s Hulk hat. After being told twice to not run, I  crouched to their level and told them, “Listen. One, we said to not run. Two, this isn’t a playground. Three, you were in here earlier making absolutely inappropriate remarks about girls. Would your mother or aunt or grandmother be okay hearing you say the thing you said around my coworker and me? Four, you don't treat your friends like they're friends, and I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like you. Now, get out and do not return unless you have your parents with you, or else I'm calling security.”

The boy who did the most talking looked at me and said, ""I can talk about girls any way I want. They're just girls and it's adult to let them know who's boss.""

At this point, I physically removed them from the store. Apparently, they’ve gone to tell their fathers about the mean lady at the store.

My manager on duty overheard this and told me that, while what they did was atrocious, I was acting completely out of bounds and could be suspended for what I did, but he'll just write me up. However, he congratulated me on scaring them.

**TL;DR:** Little kids come in and make a disturbing amount of rape jokes, so I kick them out and get in trouble.

This is a throwaway.

j_guazu,106,,152,1gdicz,,646,"This is from, a few years ago and, whilst nowhere near as bad as a lot of the stories on this subreddit, sticks in my mind as the rudest customer I've ever dealt with.

I worked in a chain restaurant in the UK while I was at uni. One evening, a family are seated in my section - mother, father, and their two adult daughters. I know them: they live a few houses up the road from me, and I used to go on these Christian youth-group excursions with the mum (a family friend's son had invited me onto them and my parents forced me to go). She had always been a very pleasant person, and the husband and kids always seemed friendly enough.

Anyway, I go over to them and say ""Hi [her name]. How are you?"" She just barks their drink orders at me, no ""can I have..."", no ""please"", no ""thank you"". Weird. 

I take them their drinks, take their order, and am putting in through when she appears next to me at the till. ""Can you take the foil off the wine bottle?"" She asks me. Yeah, apparently she wanted me to pick the foil off the neck of the wine bottle. That bit of foil that nobody takes off because it doesn't obstruct your wine-drinking in any way. I obediently go back to their table and perform this pointless task - they don't even bother to thank me.

Their food comes out and I take it to them. Again, no thanks, just a couple more drinks orders growled at me. Ten minutes later she wanders up to me again: apparently she doesn't like her food. She freely admits that there's nothing wrong with it, she ordered a calzone without ever having had one before and apparently just didn't like the concept of it. She wants to exchange it for a pepperoni pizza. Fine. I go back to the table to take the calzone away... she'd eaten two-thirds of it! Right, can't have hated it that much, anyways I took it off the bill.

Well, her replacement pizza comes out. The kitchen have kind of fucked up and done a large instead of a medium. So, I take it to her and say they've accidentally done a bigger one - but don't worry, we'll only put a regular one on the bill, and we can box-up any that's left over. Again, no thanks, but the husband wants yet another beer.

They finish and ask for the bill. Just after handing it to them, I see her talking to my manager. She had asked for her replacement pizza to be taken off the bill because she hadn't been happy with her first order - and, for some reason, he complied. They paid - without leaving a single penny as a tip - and left. She had eaten every single morsel of that pizza.

Well, next time I saw her in the street she actually had the audacity to say ""Hello j_guazu, how are you?"". I blanked that bitch, and me and my family have done ever since. And I've made it my business to make sure that as many people as possible from her church know what a scamming, disrespectful cunt she is. I can't get over how friendly she would be when I was her neighbour, but could then treat me like shit when I'm waiting on her.

AAEmmerson,76,,104,1r7jes,,645,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about £4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

pangalaticgargler,122,,147,1kakd7,,648,"This was probably a few months after I had been made a supervisor. A side note is that 90% of all my coworkers at the time were female.

One night during the summer about 15 minutes before we locked up we had 3 men come in (they were probably in their mid to late 30’s) and ordered ice cream. By the time we had finish serving them it was time for me to lock the door so I was surprised when they noticed that and decided to take their dessert outside to our patio (at this time I was thinking we had some great guys on our hands).

I asked one of my employees to go outside and wipe the windows down, clean the tables and chairs that weren’t in use, and take care of the outdoor garbage can. Now this was a downtown area strip mall that had regular police patrols and plenty of foot traffic from the movie theatre, restaurants, and coffee houses so we didn’t ever really have issues with people doing weird shit. Today was not one of those days.

I was counting my drawers and safe when two of my coworkers come into the back and one appears to be comforting the other one who once I noticed was clearly upset. I asked what was wrong and I was informed that the clients who had so kindly gone outside to eat decided the best thing to do in a situation where a 16 year old girl was cleaning around them was talk to her about how pretty she was, and how much they would enjoy doing various sexual acts with her. The amount of detail they used was nauseating. 

Let me pause right here and say that I was raised in a household where I was the youngest of 3. My two older siblings are both female and as such I have been raised to expect certain things from myself as well as my male counterparts when interacting with women. Like how women are actually people.

Anyways… I was pretty pissed so I told her I would handle it. She asked me not to, that it was all just fun and games, that they the men had just been joking around. I told her that they needed to at least be informed that they shouldn’t joke around like that with someone who obviously is uncomfortable with it.

So I give a phone to one of the other people on shift and tell them that if anything happens to call 911. I go outside and turn to these guys and tried my best to tear them a new one.

Me: So I hear you like sexually harassing 16 year old girls.
Guy 1: What are you talking about?
Guy 2: Dude chill out we were just joking around with her.
Me: Are you fucking kidding me? You were just telling her how much you would enjoy gang banging her.
Guy 2: It was a fucking joke you fucking pussy.
Me: It wasn’t a joke to her obviously. If anything you guys are kind of the joke in this situation. How old are you 35? You enjoy trolling around downtown inviting underage girls to have sex with you?
Guy 3: We aren’t fucking pedophiles you ass hole.
Me: Well technically no, you would be ephebophiles.
Guy 1: What the fuck did you just call me.
Me: Glad to see your education paid off. You need to leave.
Guy 2: We aren’t leaving we paid for this ice cream and you can’t police the sidewalk in front of your store.
Me: I can and I will. If you aren’t gone in the next 5 minutes the police will be here. If you come back and I or anyone here sees you we will call the police. Now leave.

CreatrixAnima,28,,133,1htoz3,,639,"I used to work 12 to 12 four days a week as the manager of a convenience store.  Like any proper store, we had a slushie machine that was the bain of our collective existence.  It was a constant source of sticky annoyance.  I once got yelled at by a customer for telling her child not to lick the dispensing nozzle.  But I digress.  The point is, we had a slushie machine.

One night, just as I was clocking out, a group of about four teenagers came in.  They wandered around the store as I took my till to the office to count out.  When I came back, I saw that the slushie machine had been left running and there was now a waterfall of glacier blue rasperry cascading from the drip tray into a vast pool of blue on the floor I had just finished mopping.  

So I turned it off, told my boss' idiot brother, who they wisely kept on the midnight shift lest he scare off the customers, to to mop it up, and went back into the office to wile away my precious off-time watching the closed circuit security camera.  As I suspected, one of the teenagers proceeded to place something from our shelves into his coat pocket and leave the store.  I stopped him as he left, asked him to come back in and hand me the stolen merchandise - a bottle of No-Doz.  

I brought him to the back room, where he swore all the way to Jesus and half way back that this was the first time he's ever done such a thing and this, if I would just let it go, just this once, he would never ever ever do it again.  I knew he was full of shit, but I guess I felt kind of sorry for him, so I decided to cut him a break and call his parents instead of the police.  Whay can I say?  I'm a push over.

His mom, however, was not.  When I told her what had happened, her exact words were ""Then I suggest you call the police.""  As I hung up the phone, I felt even sorrier for the kid, but I knew that letting it slide would do him no favors.  ""Sorry,"" I said.  ""Your mom said to call the police.""  And I did.

When the cop showed up, he cuffed the kid and took him away so I could go home.  On the way out of the office, he stopped, picked up the No-Doz and held it inches from the kid's face.

""See this?"" he asked.  ""It's $4.99.  Now you're in handcuffs.  You're stupid.""

Jibjumper,77,,146,1epodu,,642,"I work for an action sports clothing store in an outlet mall. Given the brand I work for and our location our customers are usually males 15 to 30, and moms buying for their sons. 

First off moms are the work customers ever I despise when they come in my store. Especially around back to school time, when they come in ""packs."" You know the type. Gabbing extremely loud as they rush through the store picking up anything and everything they see, unfolding, looking at them for a second, and despite not taking one step after picking up an item they manage to place it 3 feet from it's original spot. Their time is the most precious commodity in the world, and we are lucky they grace us with their presence. /s They are all bad in their own way but this one woman put me over the top. 

So this and her friend came in and were your typical stay at home mom shoppers. It was only me and them in the store. (Sidenote. We are the home store for our company and just had a store visit from the head of the outlet division so our store was immaculate so they could take pictures to send to the other stores.) Despite me offering to grab any sizes they might need and constantly hovering around them, to avoid having them destroy the place. They still managed to make a mess of everything. One of them asked for a tank top down that was out of reach I said no problem and grabbed a hook to grab it down. What happened next made this woman my most hated customer of all time.

While I'm grabbing the tank down. She's looking at the shirts folded below on the shelves. She pushed me to the side grabbed a stack of tshirts I had folded the night before so each shirt showed a different part of the graphic, so that when they were stacked up the pile showed the full graphic. It took me a long time to fold them like that. So she takes the stack and flips them onto the ground and proceeds to grab the one on the very bottom. She then looks at me and says ""Sorry, but then again I guess I am you're job security."" With a voice and look that just screamed I'm better than you, as she stepped over the pile of tshirts on the floor and pushed me out of the way to go to the register.

I don't know what it was about the situation that made me so furious, but I was literally shaking with anger. I walked over to her, took the items from her hands and told her to get the fuck out of my store. Obviously she threw a fit. Asked for my manager.

I've had a multitude of experiences to do with the ineptitude of the *people* that shop there but I just had an experience that has required me to vent to this wonderful sub.

A couple walks into the store and rudely demands to be told where the floating flooring is (*note* don't ever click at me, I am not a dog asshole) I tell them hoping thats the last of them that I'll see of them, I head off to the team room for a break.

About 10 minutes later my section phone starts ringing, Its the customer service counter, there's a couple at the counter having issues with EFTPOS and can't pay for their goods and because of this they want to talk to someone **because we are wasting their time**.

I get down there and lo and behold its finger clicker and his wife from before, turns out its a simple error; nothing wrong on our end, they just don't have enough money in their account to pay for their purchases.  This is a touchy subject that people don't usually like being told about.  This is the conversation that we had;

Couple (C): Your stupid EFTPOS machine isn't working and has wasted our time, this is ridiculous, me and my husband are in a rush and this needs to be done.

C: (interrupts me) There is enough money on the card! Fix your stupid machine!
Me: OK Madam, I'll process it on another machine to make sure its not our end stuffing up.

I put the transaction through and am greeted with the same error once again.

Me:  I'm getting the same error again sorry Madam, do you have an alternate method of payment? Or we can hold your items for you until you can get in contact with your bank?

C: (pulls out another card like I was the most unreasonable person ever) I'l just pay with this card, I want a discount though, you've wasted my time!

Me:  Unfortunately madam, even though this issue has taken up some of your time, we cannot offer you a discount, there is no fault on our end of things.

C: But there is money on that account, its your fault!

Me:  No it's not madam, I believe you when you say that there is money on that account, but that is an issue you will have to chase up with your bank, there is nothing I can do.

They pay for their goods and leave, and say that they will be complaining to management about their experience.

No1animeniac,82,,198,1f8k0h,,642,"The events contained within this tale occurred this past Saturday.

I was working my second open to close shift in two days. In the evening, a family of at least 5 walked into the shop. As one of the young children in the group came up to the counter, another young man off to my right stood near the other counter where we keep our trading card game cards, dices, and other gaming accessories.

He asked, ""Why are there so many different kinds of dice?""

The woman standing behind him responded, ""That's none of your fucking business.""

I explained to the young man that the different dice could be used in role playing games such as DnD, MTG, etc. He asked what those were, and the woman told him, ""You don't need to be asking question. Mind your own fucking business before I slap you head into this counter to get the point into your head.""

I don't tolerate certain things in life, and threatening a child, especially a child just asking innocent questions, is one of the things I will not tolerate.

I turned to her and said, smiling as I always do, ""Ma'am, I will not allow that in this store."" The comic store I work in is a private business, so I am fully able to do this.

She replied, ""I'll do whatever I fucking want in any fucking store I damn well please!""

I told her, ""Ma'am, you will not do that in THIS store, please. It will not happen in THIS store.""

Fortunately for her, she backed down and left the store. If she had actually done what she said she was going to, the mall security officers would have become involved.

backwardswithtime,161,,208,1cexm5,,643,"So, the set up (sorry for the length, I've been lurking for a while and finally decided to post this): I work in a big chain grocery store as a meat cutter to pay my way through university. Now, I pride myself on my customer service. I am honest, if a person wants my opinion on an item or I see them picking a low quality cut I will tell them it's crap and give them a better option. Management does not really like this, but I remind them that our job is to provide exceptional customer service and I am not going to lie to a customer just so their profits go up a by a few bucks. Regardless, I have a lot of customers who love me and I have gotten a large number of positive reviews from customers who phone in to the corporate office to tell them about the good job I've done. Basically, I don't put up with crap. If it is within my power I will help someone the way I would want to be helped. And if they are asshats I don't put up with it. So here is where the story gets fun.
About two years ago I was doing my cleanup, this involves foaming the whole department, walls, tables, floor, saw, with a very powerful and toxic if ingested soap. A customer came up to the counter and asked my to cut up the whole fryer chicken she had into parts. Normally, I would have been happy to oblige, but since the tables were covered in this foam I told her that I was unable to. She then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to do this, to which I told her that it was my job to also not poison her. She did not find that funny. She demanded that I cut the chicken for her. I pointed to the foam covering the department and repeated that I could not without getting her and anyone who eats the chicken very sick. Well that was just not good enough. She lost it. ""It's your job!"" ""You have to do this!"" all the typical bullshit that over privileged customers scream at us lowly customer service folks. So what do I do, I laugh at her tell her I'm not going to help her and that she can go talk to a manager. I turn my back to her as she storms off to complain.
Of course the manager comes flying up to me and asks what happened. I pointed out the toxic chemicals and said that I was unable to cut the bird for her and I was not going to put up with being screamed at by a customer for not making her sick. So he goes gives her a heaping amount of gift cards and sends her on her way. And from there I thought it was over, but not by a long shot. Apparently she called the regional corporate office the next day to complain about me. The complaint made its way up the chain to the district manager. Now this guy is a complete asshole, but we have always been cordial towards one another and he appreciated the outstanding customer service I have regularly provide. I show up for my next shift the following weekend and the district manager and the rest of the store managers are waiting for me. I get called into the office and asked what the hell happened. I tell them about the customer and then proceed to get chewed out by all the managers ""you have to do what she asks"" ""customer service blah blah blah"". During this I am just sitting in the chair smiling and listening. Once they are done I look at them and said something to the effect of, ""okay sure I'll cut the chicken next time, but I have a question for you. Would you guys like a multi-million dollar lawsuit on your hands, because I'm fairly sure poisoning a customer is a good way to go about getting one. I understand where you are coming from, but I have never provided poor customer service and as far as I am concerned I saved this company millions of dollars and a heck of a lot of embarrassment. So next time, if I am getting you guys, I'll go ahead and poison her. Who's contact info should I give out to her when she wants to sue?"" Everyone went silent. A lot of mumbling and repeating stuff about customer service ensued until they were done at which point I thanked all the managers by name for their time and went to go do my job. I never heard a word about it again, and thanked my lucky stars that I was a union member so I could not get fired for insubordination.

lasercatexplosion,184,,140,182dbo,,641,"About 6 years ago, when I was in high school, I was a lowly fast food worker. There were a lot of incidents involving nasty customers but I wanted to share with you all my final breaking point. 

I was working the drive through window during the dinner rush, not taking orders but handing them out the window. I was wearing a headset so I could hear the orders as they were being taken. It was ridiculously busy and I had been running around for over an hour with no stop in orders, pretty stressed but thriving because I get off on being busy like that. 

I heard one customer insisting (over the deafening roar of their diesel truck) that they didn't want special sauce on our ""flagship"" sandwich. They were being a dick about it, but whatever, some people really don't like thousand island dressing. 

Eventually I get to this order, and put it all together, making sure the burger has a grill slip for ""no sauce"". I hand the gentleman his food and turn to get his large Coke. 

When I turn around to hand him his drink, I hear, ""YOU LITTLE CUNT I SAID NO SAUCE!"" the burger comes flying through the window and hits me in the face. It's hot, there is cheese and grease and (GOD FORBID, the sauce) all over my face, hair, glasses, and shirt. This was especially disgusting to me because I was vegan at the time. Obviously the grill crew had screwed up, and now I was paying the price, as usual when the grill screwed up. 

(Vegan fast food worker? Being 16 leaves few options for employment in my area)

After a second of just staring at the guy, shocked, covered in burger jizz, I said, ""If you think you're getting another one of these you're fucking crazy.""

I took the lid off his soda and threw it on him, slammed the window shut, took off my headset, and walked out the door. I never went back.",And a burger in the face!,781,talesFromRetail
Kellynn,179,,162,1obp0u,,633,"**Background:** I work at your friendly local fabric and craft store, where the weird customers never cease to amaze me. My stories either come from the weirdness of the register or from interacting with customers on the floor. 

**Story:** I'm gonna apologize in advance because this isn't amusing like all my previous stories. I just had a really rough day and need to get this off my chest. 

I'm human just like every single customer who comes through. I don't deserve getting screamed at, belittled, and harassed for things beyond my control. Today at work I was tasked with organizing fabric and serving as backup at the register. My coworker, MK, is on register. She is middle aged, sounds like she has a mouth full of marbles, and absolutely hates everything about her job. She has also worked there eight years and is slower and less knowledgeable than me, who has worked there for a month. I clear the line in the time she gets through one customer, and then proceeds to stand and stare at me. We are not friends, and I hate being her backup. Every few seconds she hollers ""I NEED BACKUP ALREADY PLEASE, WOULD YOU GET UP HERE."" into the radio, and I have to go running. So I might as well be on register alone when she calls for backup with how much actually gets done.

We have a line out past where the line forms and growing, the line to get fabric cut continues getting larger, and everybody is stressed. I'm checking people out as fast as I can, and I'm having a bad day already thanks to a killer headache. I'm doing my best to keep it together. A man and his wife come up to buy yarn. It was originally $4.99, now marked down to $3.79 each. Their final total is right around $18. The man then proceeds to start screaming at me. ""HOW CAN YARN COST SO MUCH?! WHY IN THE HELL ISN'T IT MARKED DOWN, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY EXPECT ME TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON THIS?!"" I try to explain to him that it's already on sale as he continues to scream at me about the cost. He then screams ""THAT ISN'T DISCOUNTED ENOUGH, 20% ISN'T ENOUGH OF A DISCOUNT ON YARN, WHY CAN'T YOU MARK THIS DOWN ANYMORE?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!""

Next customer comes up. She is a middle aged woman with a few screaming children. We have too goddamn many coupons available right now. She has some 50% off coupons that were for general use, then one that was more specific. I told her I wasn't sure if anything was going to work for those specific coupons, but we could try. I try, and it doesn't work. And she freaks out and begins to yell at me. ""Well, why aren't your signs clearer, huh? Why aren't your coupons clearer?! Why don't you deal with this so customers don't have this problem because I want to save money and you're stopping me from doing that! DEAL WITH THIS, WOULD YOU??? YOU NEED TO FIX THIS BECAUSE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!""

Next customer comes up. Older woman. Sets her merchandise down and the first words out of her mouth are ""I hope you're ready to listen to some complaints because you need to deal with this."" Someone kill me now. She proceeds to berate me about how long she had to wait, and how I'm clearly not doing my job right because the line is so long. On and on about how much the store sucks, how awful and incompetent I am, how she'll never shop here again and I better fix this or nobody is ever going to stop here, everything is my fault, on and on. I finish her transaction, start ringing up the next customer, the complainer steps to the side to continue berating me as I'm ringing up the next customers. 

Another customer comes up, I'm still trying to ring her up as fast as I can, and she glares at me and snidely remarks ""Talk a little faster there, why don't you?"" 

At that point I needed to excuse myself from the register to avoid yelling at a customer or my coworker who is still standing there staring at me as I'm doing all the work. I took my break, sat down, and the combination of headache + hormonal + exhausted left me in tears in the break room. I am a nineteen year old girl. This is my first job. I'm doing the best I can. I don't understand what it is about customers who think berating me, screaming at me and harassing me will get me to work any faster when I'm already doing the best I possibly can. I am one person. I can only do so much, and I don't deserve to get treated like shit just because I'm working for minimum wage.

tldr; quit being dicks to cashiers who are doing the best they can.

So H is in a large nationwide grocery store buying Halloween candy early.  This store is having a sale on bags of candy: four large bags for $8, so long as the bags are between 18 and 18.5 ounces.

So H picks four bags and goes to the checkout.  The bitchy cashier (who I know from personal experience is always having a bad day) rings the four bags up and gives her the total, but H notices that she didn’t get the sale price.  The conversation goes something like this:

H: I think there was sale on this candy.

Cashier: This last bag of candy is over the weight limit.

*H looks at the bag; it’s 18.18 ounces.*

H: No, it’s less than 18.5 ounces.

Cashier: 18 is more than 5!

H: Um, that’s not how math works.


The Cashier still wouldn’t believe her; luckily some of the courtesy clerks backed up H’s logic and eventually she got the right price.

Edit: Guuuys, you have me all paranoid now. I tend to have footinmouth syndrome, so surely I said something lawsuit-worthy at some point when I was talking to her. Never had a pregnant employee before. D:

This just happened a few hours ago, and I'm pissed enough that I came here to tell everyone about it. So for the ranty essaypost.

The girl that worked at the gas station across the street gave her two weeks notice to come work for me, I convinced my DM to hire her because I felt bad that she was going to be pregnant and unemployed soon. *Instantly regretted it*. 

She had only worked for us for 2 weeks and complained about *everything*.

- Can't work closing because she's pregnant.

- Gets transferred to the slowest store in the district, because there is no manager and the morning shifts are for managers only. Complains to myself and the DM that she won't work at such a slow store because she's ""so used to working somewhere busy"".

- I offer *very kindly* to give her one of *my shifts* in the morning, which has me now working and a closing and opening shift back to back. 
 
She then proceeds to call me up on both of her closing shifts this past week and beg me to come in because she's sick due to her pregnancy. I know you're pregnant lady, but what the fuck do you want us to do if you can't work *anywhere* at *anytime*.

So yesterday I came in on a day I was off to work two hours of her shift, and was intent on giving her a talking to about her behaviour. Here's how this fucking conversation went:

""*name*, can we talk just you and me, please?""

""K""

""I pretty much got you this job, because -""

*rude tone* ""You didn't *get* me the job, dude.""

""Well, yes, because I felt as if you needed the work and I knew you'd be a go-""

""You know what? Be quiet. I'm counting. Don't talk to me.""

Bitch, seriously? Where else have you worked that you can speak to your boss like this? It's revenge time, preggers.

""Actually. I'm off today. You clearly don't appreciate what I'm doing for you here, so I'm just going to go home.  And if you don't want to work here, feel free to leave your uniform in the break room when you leave. Bye.""

BahamutWings,56,,111,19wobb,,639,"Hey guys, its a long story 

I'll set the scene first:
I worked in a high end UK supermarket chain on the Deli Counter (cooked meats, cheeses and hot roast chickens).
I was one of 3 guys who worked all day on the counter on Sundays, we had a morning and afternoon guy too.
All the counters (Deli, Meat, Fish and Patisserie) are run by one manager, and one assistant manager. But they only work one Sunday a month each.
So every other weekend we run it ourselves, after a few months i took over the paperwork for all counters and put myself in charge.

This system worked, my Manager approved me running it on Sundays (paperwork always done correct), my colleagues were grateful that id get the blame if shit went wrong, and i was happy as i doubled my wages through my own hard work. I got the role ""3rd Hand"". a Regular employee with manager roles to do when they weren't in.(after Deparment managers and Assistant Managers).

Now, all managers had the 1 Sunday a month deal, so often there was only one section manager a Sunday and they took on the role of ""Daily Store Manager"" (in charge for the day).

I got on with all managers except one, we'll call him McTache (only guy in the branch allowed a mustache because he has ""fuck off"" tattooed on his top lip, former bike gang memeber gone good).
He's a pain in the ass and hates young clever kids because he fucked his own youth up.

Now, one Sunday in south east london the whole Borough (county area?) had a power cut due to a fire at a electricity substation.

Our Store is the only one in 5 miles with a back-up generator (dont want to lose stock). 

And we sell hot chickens. The only hot food available that day. For 5 Miles.

I got to work EARLY (5AM) to take a van to 2 other stores too small to have generators, and take thier raw chickens.
I get back to my store and ""spike"" them all ready for rotisserie roasting and crank up the ovens to full.
We get to opening time (10 am) and ive got 10 ovens ready to go, coming out at 30 minute intervals in the day. Last oven out an hour before closing. Sensible right?
Its now McTache comes in, grumble powercut grumble (everyone else got in fine), and hes the Daily Manager.

This will be fun.

I got the paperwork for the stock transfers done and gave it to him.

McT: ""What the hell is this?!""

Me:  ""we'll i took thier stock because today were the only way people can get a hot dinner""

McT: ""oh. yes. good work""


Geez, thanks. I bite my lip, its a miracle this guy hasn't chewed me off about not asking first.


Now we proceeded to do immense business for the day, chickens selling out quickly, and we had our second highest sales day of the year (beaten only by the saturday before christmas).


I work my arse off until 3pm, chickens in, chickens out, serve chickens. Then the last oven come out.
We close at 4, so we cant cook any more in time to sell. Breath a sigh of relief and start cleaning the chicken zone.


McTache approaches.
McT: ""what are you doing?""

Me:  ""erm, cleaning the chicken area, we're sold out.""

McT: ""put more in the oven"" (80 minute cook time, 60 minutes of store time. anyone else see the problem?).

Me:  ""no, they wont be cooked in time, thats a stupid idea"".


ok, i wasn't the most diplomatic there, but i was sick of chickens.

McT: ""did you call me stupid?!"" McTache is getting his angry on.

I took my hat off, ""yes, i am, you wont sell them, thats *epic mental maths* a loss of £60 of stock and £120 profit.""

McT: ""I AM THE DSM. MY WORD IS LAW. PUT THE CHICKENS ON NOW"". fuck hes mad.

Me:  ""no chance, get someone else to do it, im off to the office to finish the paperwork"".

I walked off, leaving him bellowing at my colleagues to put on chickens.
I got my paperwork done, and went back down just after close at 4, just as the chickens came out.
He comes over and starts screaming at me:
""If you'd put them on when i said we'd have sold them. This is all your fault, im reporting you to the Store Manager""

Awww hell. The chickens get sold to staff for 50p at a loss. Worst, it took an extra half hour to clean up, something we weren't paid extra for, and i'd already put in 3 more hours that morning.

The next day at my monday evening shift i get called into the Store Managers office.
The Store Manager was a very reasonable lady, and a good friend of mine, particularly after i pioneered the ""3rd hands"" System. 

SM: ""I hear you had an argument with McT yesterday over the chickens.""

Me: ""yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you called him stupid infront of other staff and customers""

Me: ""Yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you disobeyedd the Daily Store Manager and ignored him""

At this point i am thinking i am in it now. I can't deny any of it, chicken cooking is recorded, with times and who put them in.

SM: ""Did you know we made record money yesterday because we had hot food from you on offer?""

Me: ""i thought we would, thats why i got the stock transferred early""

SM: ""a stock transfer you weren't authorised to make""

Me: ""yeah"" - the dead feeling creeps in now.

SM: ""well, you were right, you made us alot of money yesterday. And McT made the wrong call, and abused the oher staff by shouting at them. We want to thank you for your actions and reward you.""

Me: ""wait, what?!""

SM: ""The store is a partnership, we all work for each other, yesterday you made the right call for the company, were giving you a case of Jack Daniels as a thankyou for yesterday and the unpaid time you put in.""

I am happy now, my shit day is compensated for.

SM continues: ""and we're sending McT on an anger management course and he's on Disciplinary.""

Justice is served.

Next sunday McT is forced to come over and apologise to me, and acknowledge that as 3rd hand i run it, not him.
Felt good to stick to my guns and win.

VigilantInfidel,115,,175,166xrh,,632,"I was writing this tale as a response to [this question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/163f0q/do_you_ever_get_mistaken_for_an_employee_while)

**Introduction:**  I work for a security company whose uniform is a blue polo shirt with a brightly stitched yellow badge on it and black dress slacks. After my shift, I wandered into Best Buy where they wear a similar blue polo but with tan khakis. I was looking at some tablets when this commotion arises from the front of the store; people are walking toward the front, then running up to the windows. I was about to go look anyway when a customer runs back to me and says, ""Hey! You work here, right? You need to come see this!"" He sounded genuinely concerned so I didn't bother correcting him and instead followed him out of the store. There, right on front of a gathering group of people, was car that had just caught on fire.

**Act I:**  I only wanted to look at tablets but suddenly there's this whole situation unfolding and walking away just isn't an option, especially since the actual Best Buy employees were just sorta wandering out and taking pictures of the fire on their smartphones. First thing's first: I grabbed one of the yellow-shirted Best Buy Loss Prevention employees (who was also busy snapping pictures away on her phone) and told her to call 911. [Note: in any emergency, don't assume anyone is going to call 911. If you can't do it yourself, pick one person and tell them to do it *even if* someone else *may* have already done it. 911 doesn't care how many people call in to report one emergency.]

While she starts to use her phone for something productive, I start waving people away from the area and telling people to back up. I'm tapping on car windows to get people to either get out or pick a different parking space further away, but gawkers keep coming. People tend to crowd around disasters instead of running away from them -- I have no idea why -- so establishing a perimeter is important and about 300 ft is all I can reasonably protect with the sheer amount of people trying to come see what's happening. So now I'm yelling at every moron walking up to get back to take a video (seriously, why the hell are so many people walking *toward* this thing?) and finally the Loss Prevention lady gets back to me to report that the local Fire Dept is on their way. I'm about to ask her to help me keep people from getting close but she immediately disappeared. I spend the next five minutes trying to keep moronic motorists from driving literally *right by* the blaze that has now engulfed the front third of this sedan before the FD shows up and immediately gets to work.

**Act II:**  Thinking I was essentially done, the Fire Dept then assumes that I'm a Best Buy employee and asks me to see if I can go find the owner of the van that was parked closest to the fire because even though they're fighting the fire, they need this van moved. Okay, well, I can do that. When you're a first-responder, you inherit all the responsibilities of overseeing the situation until appropriate people show up, and so far, no Best Buy manager has come outside to help.

So I go into Best Buy and try to use their PA system to call out the license plate of the van in an attempt to find the owner, but I have no clue how to work their phone system. I ask one of the employees at customer service (who probably had no idea what was happening outside) to dial me into the PA and then hand it over to me but he gives me this look of *Seriously? You don't know how to do this yourself?* He does it for me, then hands me the phone and tells me to start talking when I hear the beep. Well, there's no beep. So I tell him and he gets even more of an attitude with me, giving me a look that said *How stupid are you?* He turns the phone around to me and tells me what numbers to press and I do it myself. Luckily it worked, even though there never was a beep, and I moved on to making the same announcement in every store up and down that strip mall, just in case the owner of the van had gone into a different store. I never did find the owner.

**Epilogue:**  Finally I reported back to the Fire Chief and the police officer who showed up. Everything was long under control so they didn't need me any more and I went back inside the Best Buy to resume my shopping. After a couple minutes, the same jackass employee passes me in an aisle, does a double-take and says ""Oh shit, you don't work for us do you?"" The look on his face was priceless and he felt so bad that he offered to buy me a Dasani. Hey, it wasn't much but I took it and left without buying anything because really, at that point, I wasn't interested in being there anymore.

TL;DR: Repeatedly mistaken for a Best Buy employee, I help out in a minor emergency, receive very little help from *actual* employees, and then get an attitude from an employee for not knowing how to work their intercom.

So I work in a petrol station. I'm unaware of the rules regarding mobile phone usage in other countries or in other petrol stations but at my one in particular the use of mobile phones is prohibited. I don't know why; all I know is I can't authorise a pump if someone is using a mobile phone (same goes for smoking a cigarette, a kid under 16 years old or someone who blatantly doesn't know what they're doing). The company I work for routinely does checks on this to make sure the staff are authorising pumps correctly. If you fail to authorise a pump without doing the checks the first time you get a verbal warning. Second is a written warning. Third is a second written warning and retraining. Fourth is dismissal.

So I'm working one day with an older co-worker (hereby referred to as 'D') of mine. She gets flustered easily and can't handle prickish customer very well. This guy rolls up in a BMW (hereby referred to as 'BMW'), lifts the pump and proceeds to start talking on his phone while trying to dispense fuel. D turns the pump off. BMW storms in to the shop as thus ensues:

* BMW: ""Phones don't even affect pumps.""
* D: ""You cannot use your phone while dispensing fuel.""
* BMW: ""Show me where in this place it says that.""
* D: ""It says it on all the pumps and it says it in here also. I cannot authorise a pump if you're using your mobile phone.""
* BMW: ""Listen to me, I don't have to take lectures from the likes of you people. Don't you dare chastise me.""
* D: ""I am not chastising you all I'm saying is...""
* BMW: ""Yes you are. I pay your fucking wages, people like me keep these sorts of places in business.""

He then proceeded to write D's name on a piece of paper. At this point I felt the need to chime in.

* Me: ""You wanna calm down there?""
* BMW: (He points) ""Mind your own business.""

He leaves and drives off. What appeared to be his wife was sitting in the passenger seat and she looked like she was a little embarrassed. A customer who was waiting to be served laughed at him on his way out.

By taking our names he seemed to be threatening to lodge a complaint or something. It's been a few days since this happened and no complaint has been lodged.

It seems a bit odd, trying to post a story as the horrific events in Boston unfold.  So I'd like to take a moment and say thank you to the police, firefighters, EMTs, ER nurses and doctors, race volunteers, and military personnel who all immediately responded to this horrible attack.  No panic, no hesitation, just an immediate reaction to the call for aid.  You guys and gals are the best.  To the victims and people of Boston, my thoughts are with you.  I wish you all a speedy recovery and my deepest condolences for your losses.

The store attached to our station was a fairly large one.  Several aisles of snack food and basic consumables (TP, paper plates, canned food, etc) along with your standard issue roller grill, microwave, half-a-dozen coffee pots, and a huge cooler full of soda, milk, and beer.  Lots of beer.  This IS Oregon, after all.

That beer was a thorn in my side as a cashier.  Bored rich kids thought it would be fun to try and grab-n-go with it, or use fake IDs, or get someone else to buy it for them, and it was a constant battle against them in order to keep from getting fired or possibly arrested.  Everyone in town knew I was a stickler for the rules.  This guy, however, tried anyway.

A car drives in and parks right in front of the store.  I can see out our full glass door into the car, it has two guys in front and two girls in back.  The passenger gets out, walks in, and heads straight for the beer cooler.  Great, I'm going to have to deal with this.  He gets his cell phone out, and makes a call.  I can see the driver answer HIS phone, and it's pretty obvious that they are conversing back and forth.  So the guy in the store, let's call him Sergei, comes up to the register with a half-rack of Coors Light, a six-pack of Bridgeport, and two six-packs of Mikes Hard Lemonade.  Oh, boy.

""Sir, I'm going to need to see your ID...""

He begins reaching for his wallet.

""...and the IDs for everyone in the car.""

Oregon has a shoulder-tapping law.  This means that, if you park in front of my store with multiple people in the car, and come in to get beer, I have to see EVERYONE'S ID or else I could get fined about $5,000 and potentially charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  This, of course, does not sit well with Sergei.  He first insists that they are all 21.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  He then insists that all the beer is for him.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  Then he complains that other cashiers have done it for him (yeah, right).  Doesn't matter, still need to see ID.

Now Sergei's gone from begging/joking to angry.  He starts rambling on about how he knows the owner and the owner would do it for him.  Dude, did you not hear me the last four times?  It doesn't matter, I still need to see ID.  Plus, since the owner was the one who gave the cashiers their OLCC training *because he's certified to do so,* I highly doubt it.  Finally, Sergei DEMANDS that I call the owner at home, and get him down to the station to clear this up.

No.  Just, no.  I'm not calling the owner, a very nice man who respected his employees and treated them well, at 9pm, just to interrupt his family time, have him drive 20 minutes down to the station, just so he call tell you you're an idiot and kick you out.  I like the owner.  And before you ask, no, I'm not calling the general manager or any of the assistant managers.  I'm in charge right now, and before I sell you this I. Need. To. See. ID.

But Sergei's heels are firmly dug into the ground like a cartoon donkey.  He's gone into the ""repeat the same thing over and over again"" bit, telling me to call the owner.  Alright, I've had enough of this.  I intercomm one of the other employees to come in and cover the register, and tell Sergei I'm going to make a call.  ""FINALLY, JUST DO WHAT I ASK!"" he bellows.  Oh, my friend, that's not quite the case.

Yes, there was a phone next to the register.  But to be honest, I wanted this to be a surprise, so I went into the back room.  Instead of calling the owner, I called, you guessed it, the local constabulary.  Would you be so kind as to send over one of your fine officers to deal with a young rapscallion who's attempting to purchase intoxicating beverages with the intent to distribute them to potential minors?  You would?  Oh, marvelous, see you soon!

I come back out of the stock room and tell Sergei that someone will be here soon, just wait around for a few minutes.  He throws his hands in the air in disgust, walks outside, and lights up a cigarette.  Sadly, he was facing away from me when the police car rolled up and parked behind his car, so I couldn't see his facial expression.  More's the pity, I'm sure it was priceless.

The officer steps out, greets, Sergei, and asks the driver and two girls to step out.  He then ushers all four of them inside.  The girls look nervous, the driver looks pissed, and Sergei looks in shock.  I manage to keep a victory grin from spreading across my face.  An effort of will that was, let me tell you.

The officer then asks why he got called down here on a complaint that someone was trying to buy beer without showing ID.  Sergei counters saying he DID show me ID.  The officer then looks at me.  ""No, he never actually did.  And he never got ID for the people in the car.""  Sergei denies being in the car.  ""I saw your car park, you get out of the passenger's seat, come inside, and call the driver, sir.  You definitely came in the car.""  Sergei then gets angry, calls me a liar, and was probably thinking of trying to come over the counter at me when the officer calls it all to a halt.  ""How about this, ladies and gentlemen.  Let me see everyone's ID.""

They all very reluctantly pull out IDs.  Sergei is 24.  The driver is 23.  Girl #1 is 17.  Girl #2 is 16.  Uh-oh.

So the entire troupe is herded back outside, and another couple of units arrive.  The first officer asks if I can call the assistant manager that only lives a few blocks away, so that they can look at surveillance footage.  No problem, that AM is the one I'm in classes with, he'd love to help out an investigation.  I give him a quick call, and he's at the station within 2 minutes.  He and the officer go into the back room and watch the tape.  The beer is slowly getting warm on the counter.  I'm getting bored.

The officer comes back out, shakes my hand, and thanks me for calling this in.  He then goes outside, and promptly arrests both Sergei and the driver.  Neither are very happy about it, but don't put up any sort of fight, just shouting and vague threats towards me and the station.

The girls were the icing on the justice cake.  The officer made them call their parents so they could be picked up, and then made them explain exactly WHY they had been called late at night to a gas station with police officers there.  Nothing deters future criminal activity like the ""I'm very disappointed in you"" speech.  That victory grin was now next to impossible to suppress.

Finally, it's all over.  My AM wrote out a note for the GM to review the tapes in the morning, thanked me for giving him something to do that evening, and left.  The next day, I had a $100 gas card and a nice little note in my employee file.  Never heard from Sergei or his friend again.

Inceptagon,107,,152,1guebv,,621,"In my fastfood job, I get quite a few customers who try to rip me off or get stuff for free. Usually they're subtle or at least halfway-reasonable about the ""misunderstandings,"" like exploiting coupons, so it surprises me when I get someone this inane and nonsensical about it. 

I was working on a drive-thru shift today, and we get this older lady (not quite ""elderly"" but certainly in her early fifties or so) who orders about $12 worth of food. She gets to the window and she's like ""Oh dear, I forgot my purse,"" and then she looks at me expectantly like she wants me to give her something. I respond, ""I'm sorry about that, ma'am! Would you like us to hold your food for you? Just let us know that you're back and we'll have it ready for you. We'll make sure it's hot!""

She looks at me for a moment and then says ""Oh, yeah, thanks. That's very thoughtful of you,"" in a way that sounded quite sarcastic, making me very confused. She then drove away. I shrugged and told them to cancel the order so we could wait until she came back to make it fresh.

Fast forward about twenty-five minutes, and she returns. She pulls up to the speaker box and says ""Yeah, I came through here earlier and I didn't have my purse, now I'm back,"" and I reply ""Alright ma'am, please pull around to the window!""

When I take her money, I can tell she's really pissed, and I don't understand why. I figured it was frustration and embarrassment at having not brought her money. Turns out I was kinda right.

When she gets all of her food, hot and fresh like we promised, she proceeds to unload on me.

She says, ""Do I get anything for the trouble?""

I say, ""I'm sorry, ma'am? What was that?""

She says very forcibly, ""I'm an old lady and you made me drive all the way back home for my money! The least you could do is give me a free drink or a discount or something. But it looks like you don't even care.""

I wear a baffled look on my face for a moment as I try to imagine what she's getting at, and finally I say ""I'm sorry, I can't give you anything for free.""

She frowns and says ""Do you have any idea how much of an inconvenience that was to me? Terrible customer service, just terrible. Terrible."" She says this as she looks away from me and shakes her head disapprovingly.

I try to apologize again, but she cuts me off and says ""You know what? Forget it, just..."" and drives away.

With these kinds of people, I almost wish I could ask them what planet they're from. NASA needs to know about it.

RedHeadedBug,89,,143,1nyphx,,629,"Well, as I have mentioned before, I work at a pet supply store. This means that we sell all manner of dead animal parts for dogs to chew on. We have a lot of people come in looking for something for their teething puppies to chew on.

When the customer seems like they are really interested in rawhide for their puppies, I try to steer them away from rawhide and towards bully sticks. They are pretty easily digestible and generally don't cause the impaction problems that rawhide can especially in puppies who tend to swallow larger pieces than they should. For anyone who might not know, bully sticks are made of ""beef pizzle"" which is really just a hilarious was of saying it's bull penis.

I had a customer in yesterday whom I helped and sent him on his way with a braided bully stick for his 6 month old lab mix puppy. I of course warned him to make sure the pup wasn't trying to swallow huge pieces of it he might choke on. I thought he left pretty happy.

I was wrong. I got in for my ""truck shift"" at seven this evening and lo and behold this guy has been waiting for me for the last half hour and had apparently called to speak to me several times today. He had refused to speak to the three managers we had in tonight and said he would only speak to me. He looked seriously pissed off and I had no clue as to why. 

Angry Customer: Why the hell didn't you tell me what was in this?! (as he is waving the slightly chewed braid in my face)

Me: I'm sorry sir! Does your dog have an allergy to beef? I thought it would be alright since you said you had given him beef rawhide in the past.

AC: NO! That isn't it at all! I went home and looked up these ""bully sticks"" and they are PENIS!!

Me: Yes sir. I'm sorry I didn't know that it would be a problem. I can return it for you and get you your money back.

AC: I don't want my money back! You don't understand! When I got home last night I didn't have enough hands to open my door and hold the dog so I put the damned thing in my mouth! I put a bully penis in my mouth! How am I suppose deal with this? It's indecent to sell these things without telling customers what they are made of!

At this point I'm trying not to laugh while I'm apologizing and seem sympathetic but I'm having a really hard time. I accidentally let a little snort out while trying to breath without laughing. The guy huffs loudly at me, claims that I have been no help to him at all and storms out of the store with the bully stick in hand.

I have had tons of funny reactions from people finding out what bully sticks are but this is by far the funniest. Also as a side note, am I the only one who thinks that ""beef pizzle"" sounds like Snoop Dogg (he wont even be ""Snoop Lion"" to me) wrote the ingredients list?

kudrew12,80,,108,1hcmos,,624,"I was recently promoted to Customer Service in early June and I've been bracing myself for some /r/TalesFromRetail worthy stories. Hopefully this one is up to standard.

I was working the closing shift at my local grocery store. It was the first night that I would be doing this without somebody training me. So far, so good. The phones had been silent for about 15 minutes and there weren't many customers coming up to the counter which made the night go slowly.

It's about 8pm and the phone rings. I answer with the typical ""how can I help you"" intro expecting a wide variety of things. Except for this. The caller responds to me, ""Hi, I'm in your store right now and need some assistance.""

""Oh, you're actually here?""

""Yes, I'm by the meat counter and I'm having a hard time finding the 12 packs of Diet Rite. Can you help me?""

""Yessir. Those will be in aisle 7 with all the other sodas. It should be located toward the middle of the aisle.""

""And what was your name again?""

""It's kudrew12.""

""Alright, kudrew12, I want you to come find me and show me exactly where they are because I can't find the fucking things.""

""Oh, okay... I'll send someone over.""

""No! I want you, kudrew12. You seem to know where they are and nobody else can find them. I've got a big beard and a hunting vest on. I should be easy to find.""

*CLICK*

I called my manager over and told them what was up. They told me to stay behind the counter because I was the only person working Customer Service that night and that they would go find the customer instead. My manager told me beforehand that we might be out of Diet Rite and they would be able to check the inventory easier than I would.

A few minutes later, the customer comes up to the customer service counter with my manager following behind. The customer starts with, ""I want to file a complaint.""

""Okay. What is it about?"" I'm beginning to reach for the complaint forms when he responds.

""Nobody in this store listens to directions. I specifically asked for you because I thought you were smart enough to know where a 12 pack of Diet Rite would be and could help me find it. I guess I was wrong. I didn't want this other guy cause he's telling me you're out! I bought some here yesterday! There's no way those are out of stock!""

""Well, sir, it is on sale and I can write a rain check for you. Those won't expire and we should have some Diet Rite in stock again tomorrow morning when the vendors come in."" My manager nods and confirms that we can do this for the customer.

""I don't have time for a fucking rain check. I came in here for Diet Rite and I'm not happy with the way you all run your store. Are you (pointing at me) so privileged that you can't come out from behind the fucking counter?""

My manager replies, ""At the moment, yes. He's the only one here tonight and I needed him to stay and answer the phone for crazy people like you. He's not here to cater to your command over a phone call, *within the store*. Just come back tomorrow for your Diet Rite or take your commands to (*insert competitor here*).""

The customer tried to say something in return, but decided to stop and walk out. On the way out, he shouted at some other customer while pointing in our direction, ""THESE PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WHAT I WANT!""

This actually happened last night. As you can tell by my title, I'm not in America. I work at a Canadian Hardware Store. We do accept Amex though, as many people out here have it. Here in Canada - we use Chip/Pin for most cards now.

These two customers come to my till with a flatbed cart that has patio sets and accessories on it. I scan through their items and I give then their total. 

The man tells me Amex so I tell him to insert the chip or swipe. 

Man: ""Oh sweetie (I hate being called sweetie, it's patronizing and stupid), we're from the USA. We don't use chip cards there.

I'm thinking: Oh well that's great, you can just swipe your card and go on your way.

Me: ""Alright then swipe your card, stripe towards the inside.""

So he swipes his card and it's declined. I notify him and he loses his shit. 

Man: ""TRY IT AGAIN. I HAVE MONEY ON THE CARD.""

Okay, if you say so. We try again and it's declined. His wife then decides that her card should work. So we try that too. Nope. Declined.

Man: ""CAN'T YOU KEY IN MY CARD?! WHY WON'T YOU ACCEPT MY AMEX?""

Me: ""Unfortunately I cannot key cards, only customer service can.""

Man: ""I'M NOT WAITING IN THAT LINE UP THERE.""

Me: ""Ookay.. Do you have another card to try?""

Man: ""NO. I HAVE THIS ONE. YOU BETTER CALL SOMEONE TO FIX IT.""

So I call my manager, tell him the customers are upset because their US cards aren't working. As I'm explaining this to my manager, the man gets a call from Amex. We all hang up and my manager comes up. 

Man: *to manager* ""Your cashier is declining my card, but I just got a call from Amex because I'm travelling. It better work now."" *to me* ""What are you waiting for?! Set up the machine!""

His card goes through now, okay whatever. His wife has this smug look on her face.

Wife: ""I told you we should have called!""

Man: ""I shouldn't have to!! They should expect me to travel! I'm an important man! Are they communists?!""

They continue this argument out to our parking lot. All I can think is that I never believed that US customers were truly like that (after seeing some TFR stories I assumed they were made up).

endersp,141,,232,1q8pnz,,617,"I used to work at a big blue box store known it's ""low prices"", was there for three years. By the time I left I had become a bitter asshole (side effect of being in retail too long for some people),  but when I started I was the nicest six foot five behemoth you would ever meet. Now I am an atheist living smack dab in the middle of the heavily Christian area of my state, never had much of a problem keeping to my self about my beliefs or lack thereof however you want to put it and I did my best to never get in anyone's face about their preaching.
  Now it's been a month since I started and I'm at the point where I'm super bored during every break, so I read a lot, probably three books a month, the book I'm reading at the time is Letter to a Christian Nation by Sam Harris, and I'm minding my own business, reading my book when one of the older cashiers walks by and sees my book and starts screeming at me how I shouldn't brink that Satanist trash to work and I need to put it away, I attempt to explain how she is mistaken (never works, older me wouldn't have even tried) and she screams that I'm creating a hostile work environment for believers by having that book. She walks out and I assume we're done with this.

Now at this point I would like to point out that our break room had a community book shelf in it. There were probably fifty books on it at the time around 20 of which were either heavily Christian themed or falt out religious books and texts, there were three copies of the bible for fuck sakes. Associates forced to work Sundays could be heard praying loud enough to hear and a few times some of the older gals played a local church's broadcast of their sermon! All of this is important too know for the ruthlessness that happened when I got off my break.
  
 As I clock in to resume work I get a prompt from the time clock to report to the store manager's office. Seeing as how I'm newer I freak out and practically sprint to the front of the store to the office, knock on the door and am greeted by the man himself, he smiles and asks me to come in and take a seat. I do and see the shift manager is there too, nothing is said for a solid minute before the store manager breaks the silence and asks me about the book. 
B = store manager J= shift 
 
B: so Ender, we had a report that you were reading some offensive material in the break room today
 
 Me: I want reading anything offensive, it was a book that I kept to myself and read silently during my lunch

 J: someone sad that the book you were reading offended them and they asked you to put it away, it's against company policy to disturb the break room. And we're going to have to give you a coaching and send you home for the day
Me: for reading a book!?

 B: for having an offensive book at work and causing a seen

 Me: really!? Because last time I checked there's bibles on the book shelf, employees play church sermons every Sunday and more offensive to an athiest than me reading a book! The break room might as well be a church! And if you write me up your going to have to do so to about 15 other people cause I will lodge a complaint as well!

B and J look at each other and cringe knowing that I stopped just short of saying I would call corporate as well

B: we... we're not aware of this and because of this we're not going to write you up and we will evaluate the policy of the break room, we would still like to send you home but you will be paid for your full shift.

satanicwaffles,56,,126,1k7nwe,,622,"**BACKGROUND**

I work in the auto parts portion of a large Canadian department store, which also has a auto service department. We will often get people who will buy a headlight or a replacement belt, then ask me to install it for me. I am an 18 year old guy, so I am used to older people disregarding what I say and trying to gently bully me into doing things for them with the thret that they will call my boss. My boss is a cool guy and doesn't put up with their bullshit.

Anyways, I always politely tell them that I am not a mechanic, and that if they want something installed, they should shuffle a few feet around the corner and talk to the service desk who will be more than happy to schedule them in. Most people understand that I can't go work on their car on their due to liability issues, but some people just don't get it and will storm off in a huff complaining about poor customer service.

Sometimes they go to install it themselves, and we do have a few screwdrivers that we will lend for this exact thing. Unfortunately for customers, some cars now use Torx screws instead of Philips or Robertson heads. 

**EVENT**

The other day we had an older lady (probably around 63-70) who, after trying to get me to install it for her, borrow a screwdriver and went at it herself. She comes storming back in saying that I need to get her the screwdriver ""with the funny star point.""

*Me:* I'm sorry ma'am, we don't have any Torx screwdrivers to lend. We have them for sale is Aisle 39 for $1.99 a piece.

*Her:* Well what the hell do you people do when someone come into the shop to get a bulb changed?!

*Me:* The mechanics use their own tools

*Her:* Well go get me one of them to install it!

*Me:* I cannot do that ma'am. Those are their own tools which they have purchased with their own money and with which they make their livelyhood. All of our mechanics have a strict no-lending policy. Also, they are not independant mechanics. If they are working for us, they cannot do work for free.

*Her:* You don't know that! Go ask them! I'm sure they would all love to help a lovely little old lady like me!

Up until that point, she was just an annoying customer like hundreds before her. Now she was an entitled bitch who though she could make people do things for her. I politely tell her I will go ask one of the mechanics. I quickly run through the situation, and one of the mechanics gleefully volunteers to ""help"" this lady. He comes up to desk and says:

*Mechanic*: You were looking to get a bulb installed ma'am? If you make an appointment with service I can get right on your work order?

*Her:* Well I was hoping a kind young man (the mechanic is 50+ and looks it) would love to help a little old lady in a bind.

*Mechanic:* Do you have cookies or beer?

*Her:* Ummm, excuse me?

*Mechanic:* I will do work for free for two things. Cookies and beer. If you don't have any, please stop wasting my time. If you do, bring your car around to the back of the shop. Actually, come to think of it, I will work on a car for free for a third thing, but it would be disturbing to get that third thing from you.

Well, when he said that last bit, her face turned redder than a cooked lobster. She turned around and walked out without saying another word.

**TL;DR: Mechanics like cookies and beer, not sex with women older than their Mom.**

fireball03,111,,138,1c5h8j,,616,"Background: I work in an amusement park selling personalized souvenirs. When this story took place, I had worked there for five years and was a supervisor, and was the female member of management. Our office is directly behind the sales counter.


It was the hottest part of the summer, and we were in full swing. During my shift we were having a management meeting with all 5 supervisors, senior supervisor, assistant manager, regional director, and the district manager. Since it was my shift, I had been keeping a partial ear open in case there were any emergencies. 

There is a tone, that when you've worked sales for a while, will recognize immediately, it signals warning. It is before the yelling starts, but has the same terseness that a girl will use when their guy is in hot water. I heard this tone coming through the wall, but since a lead (lowest management level) was there I didn't go rushing out. Almost immediately an employee pops their head in the door and says, ""fireball03, we need you out here, NOW"" 

It was the look on their face that made me race to the counter. When I got there I saw her. She was obese, wearing a minuscule bikini top and cut off jean shorts with the top button undone. She had spent most of the day in the sun and her body was so sunburned that there were spots that were turning purple. With her were 3 young girls between 5-9 equally as large all holding their own funnel cake and souvenir cups. They were doing what all kids do when they are hot and tired, whining. The lady, you could tell, had an awful day.

I went up with my friendliest smile to try and figure out the situation. Whenever I have an angry guest I introduce myself and inform them of my position so that they know I am in a position to help. Having seen her situation I was ready to fix anything I could to hopefully make her day a little better. Instead AG (angry guest) said this.

Me: Hi, im firball03, im a supervisor here, let's figure out what's going on ( i hadn't been told the issue at this point)

AG: You work here?

Me: Yes I do

AG: You can't help me, I want a man to help me. What about him? ( pointing to the lead)

Me: Well I am his boss, so I would be able to better fix the issue (at this point the leads face was one of terror, he had only been promoted the week before and hadn't had to deal with an angry guest)

AG: No, he will help me!

I turned to the lead and gave him an encouraging nod and took a step back. After a little back and forth it turns out that she didn't like the product. She had already seen the product before she bought it. Since these are personalized we can't do returns without supervisor authorization.

Lead: (to me) am I allowed to do that?

AG: Why are you asking her, you're a man

Lead: She's my boss and I can't do returns

At this time the management meeting was over and they were all coming out. The walls are paper thin so they heard everything.

AG:(to the group) Can one of you help me?

DM: Sorry fireball03 is in charge you'll have to ask her

Me: I'm sorry, unfortunately we cannot return these products and all sales are final, I am so sorry I wasn't able to help you, have a wonderful day! (Still with my super friendly smile and a slightly apologetic look on my face)

Had she not decided that a man would be able to help her better, she would have walked away with at least a partial refund and a fixed product. My bosses were cracking up. And the great thing was that there was nothing I did that I could have gotten in trouble for.

ResultsVary,99,,173,1lwy9e,,618,"So I work for a massive electronics company. I'm also a manager. I am strictly on the floor, responsible for sales. I approach a woman who obviously looks pissed. I have been in retail for about 10 years, and so I know how to deal with customers.

Anywho. My company has penny deals on some of the things we sell in our stores. In the ad it clearly says ""while supplies last"". Currently it was a little pencil sharpener. She approaches me.

She was older... probably in her 60s. Let's just, for the sake of the story called her OW. 

OW: Do you have any more of these? -points at the penny pencil sharpener-

Me: I apologize, ma'am. We are out of those. 

OW: What do you mean you're out?

Me: Well, when we run these sorts of deals, we only get a limited amount in. 

OW: Well. How many did you get in?

Me: -pulls out handheld and begins counting-

OW: What are you doing? 

Me: I'm counting how many we got in.

OW: I don't care. You know? I've been around for awhile and I remember back when things were done with a smile and a handshake and companies actually stocked things.

Me: I apologize ma'am, but we only get sent a limited amount.

OW: I need to speak to a manager.

Me: I am a manager. 

OW: Well. I need to speak your company head then. Where is he?

Me: Uhm. Well. I can give you a 1-800 number to call customer service, or give you the e-mail to reach our higher ups. 

OW: No. I want to write a letter. What's his home address?

Me: I don't have that kind of information. 

OW: Ungh. -storms off.-

I roll my eyes and go back to doing what I was doing, before hearing over my radio that I need to come up to customer service asap. I get up there, and lo and behold there's OW there raising hell.

She had grabbed a 5 pack of pink erasers and pulled one out of the package and was trying to buy it for 1/5 of the package price. 

I explained to her that unfortunately we only sell those particular erasers in either 5 packs or 3 packs. She begins a rant about the olden times where you could get what you wanted in a store. I nodded to the cashier and walked away. Only a little, because I knew that I would be needed again.

She decided to buy the 5 pack and sure enough, I get called over 5 minutes later. When I approached the register again, she was cursing and storming off. 

I asked the cashier (who is terrified that with every angry customer, we'll fire him. he doesn't understand retail.) what happened. She had given him a 5, and he in turn gave her the change. After he closed the drawer, she dug back into her purse and pulled out the exact change. She was demanding the cashier open the drawer and give her back exact bills.

In most stores nowadays the registers are locked and only managers can open them. She had told the cashier when he explained that to her that ""In the olden days you could just reopen the register.""

McKernanx32,71,,121,1bnss8,,616,"I'm sorry if this is a little long, but i find it to be a fairly entertaining story to tell, so i thought some of you would enjoy it....

I used to work a tech support desk at a big electronics retailer. Part of our job there was to handle service plan claims, which involved testing the item, and then shipping it to the service center. We would always warn people that if the item came back with a no fault found diagnosis, the customer then had to pay $25 to get the item back. We even had said customers sign a disclaimer to this effect. Still, every time an item came back NFF, we would get a large argument. This is why we insisted on testing EVERY SINGLE ITEM thoroughly before sending it out, that way we could verify that yes, indeed there was a problem. Most of the time, however, when we couldn't verify the problem, the customer would still insist that we send it out.

On top of the normal daily arguments we would get, this one particular instance sticks out in my mind, mainly because i walked away with a injury and ended up sending a guy to prison for it. This particular customer, i will call him Bob from here on out, had dropped off his DVD/VCR combo about a week before, claiming that it did not work. At the counter it was tested, but the Bob wouldn't even describe a problem, just saying that it didn't work over and over. We plugged it in, played both disks and VHS tapes, and even recorded to VHS for him, just to prove that it did, in fact, work. With no additional details given, though, he still insisted that it didn't work and that we needed to send it out. So we did, in fact, send it out for him, sighting the issue as ""client states unit does not function. Could not verify issue at store."" and we made him sign a disclaimer saying exactly that, and spent the better part of 20 minutes explaining to him that if/when the item comes back NFF, he would have to pay the fee to pick it up. Of course, Bob agreed verbally and in writing, so i though that we were at least relatively safe.

Fast forward one week. The DVD/VCR had been received that morning, and Bob had been called to come pick it up and reminded that he would, in fact, need to pay the $25 to pick the item up, as they could not find a single problem with the device in question. This night it was myself and one other associate (we shall call him Dave), who happened to be working the counter when Bob walked in. Dave greeted Bob fairly nicely and took his receipt and went and found the device. He then informed Bob, yet again, that the item came back with NFF and is, in fact, working exactly as it is supposed to. He even offered to test it again for Bob to show him. He then reminded Bob about the $25 NFF fee that had to be paid for us to release the item. Of course, Bob was appalled. ""What $25???? I'm not paying that shit! You fixed it, and now you want to claim that it was never broke just to get my money!"" Dave went back and forth with him for a few minutes, and then walked away from the counter to call a manager. Unfortunately, he left the DVD/VCR sitting on the counter, well with in the customers reach.

I spotted this, and i also spotted Bob reach out, put his hands on the unit, and peer in to see if we were watching. I quickly reacted, walked over and put my hands on the item, hoping i had caught it before Bob had fully formed the idea to run. I greeted Bob nicely, and then tried to diffuse the situation, explaining the $25 again, and also reminding him that i was the one that tested the item for him originally, and it clearly worked here at the counter. Unfortunately, he was not going to back down on this issue. Bob starts to yell that he wants his unit, and that i cant keep it from him. He yells that i cant keep his product from him. He also yells lots of obscenities at me. While this was going on, i move to pick up the unit and move it off the front counter, out of Bob's reach. Unfortunately for me, i was a little too slow. Bob's ninja like hands dart out and grab hold of the other end of the device, attempting to pull it from my grip. I refuse to let go, telling him that as of this moment, that device is the property of The store, and that i cant release it to him. He yells to give it to him, and i tell him again that i would be happy to if he would simply pay the $25 fee. Bob did not like this, and decided that i was serious about not letting go, so his hands quickly let go of the unit.

Unfortunately, after letting go, Bob was left with a boiling anger, and a lack of something to do with his hands. So of course he did the only logical thing with them that he could think of and reached out for my neck. Here i am, being strangled over a counter by a 6 foot tall 50 something man, and all i could do was yell out. Luckily the guy working at the LP desk was close enough to run over and tackle old Bob to the ground.

You can guess the next few bits, what with the management, the cops, the reports, court, etc. The best part was before the police would take him out of the store, they dragged him over to the counter and made him pay the $25! Turns out that Bob was out on parole for assault, and obviously had just violated. Just another fun time at the service desk!

TL;DR: Don't leave things alone on a counter where a customer can grab it if there is a dispute!

FredFltStn,115,,193,1qn3fi,,617,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**OFFER:**  Thank you, thank you, and thank you, to everyone that’s taken the time to read and comment on my [stories](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/). I’m looking forward to sharing more of the craziness as I gear up for the coming New Year’s Eve. I know it’s not even Thanksgiving yet, but as you can imagine, I get a LOT busier the closer we get to NYE.

I know that we’re all big fans of reddit. I’m particularly impressed with some of the great things that go on here, like /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, /r/Loans, /r/Assistance, /r/SantasLittleHelpers/, and /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/, to name only a few.

I know money is tight for a lot of people right now, but reading some of the stories on /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ always chokes me up. Thankfully, I have a great job, good friends, and I’m able to provide for my family. I can’t even begin to imagine how hard it is for those parents that are struggling to provide a Christmas for their kids.

Since I started posting my stores and pictures, I’ve received several comments and PM’s from people asking to buy our company shirts. We don’t actually sell them to the public, since they’re kind of a badge of honor for those who’ve lived and worked the craziness first hand. 

Now I’m a big believer in Karma, and I wanted to do something that would encourage all of us to help out our fellow redditors AND kick start the holidays. I think I’ve come up with an idea. You help out a fellow redditor from the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ or /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ subs, and I’ll send you a **FREE PYROSPOT T-SHIRT**. 

**- HERE’S THE DEAL -**

* Spend at least $10 to purchase a gift for a child from the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ sub or the /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ sub. Make sure to read and follow the directions posted in the sub on how to do it.

* Post a comment to the requestor and let them know that you’ve played Santa. Please don’t mention me or my company in your post, because that’s not what playing Santa is about.  

* PM me the same proof of participation that you send to the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ sub or the /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ sub moderators, as well as the shirt size and a mailing address where you would like me to send the shirt.

* Bask in the knowledge that you’ve helped a fellow redditor out AND gotten a free shirt for doing it.

It’s that easy. Buy a gift for a kid, get a free T-Shirt. Since I don’t usually keep that many on hand, I’m actually going to have more printed up just for this. You can check out the shirts [here](http://imgur.com/a/NYx2C). The shirt is available in safety green or white. I’ll pay for the shirt and the shipping (continental US only). Would someone please call my accountant and tell him that this is all a valid tax deduction. 

**- RULES -**

* Limit 1 shirt or offer per person. I’m trying to spread the love, not outfit your baseball team. Sizes are Small, Medium, Large, XL, 2XL, 3XL. These are standard Classic Fit Adult T-Shirts, so order size accordingly.

* Continental US only. Sorry my international reddit friends, but I’m afraid the shipping would bankrupt me.

* Limited to the first 100 or so people who participate. I’ve seen how this reddit thing works, if I didn’t say this, I’d be printing up 30,000 shirts. It’s going to take several weeks to get the shirts in the mail, but I hope to have them all shipped and delivered before Christmas.

* If you try and scam me, I will post your mailing address in my next story. I should also remind you that I own a company that deals in explosives. Just sayin (kidding of course). 

* I get to change the rules or make up new rules if I see that they’re needed. That’s the joy of being the boss.

* Josh is not eligible for this promotion. 

The other thing I'm going to ask is for all of you to help spread the word. I would love for as many people as possible to know about this offer. Feel free to Facebook, tweet, or use smoke signals to let people know. Nothing would make me happier than if we ran out of kids who needed Christmas presents. 

Merry Christmas! Now go buy a kid some presents.

**UPDATED 11/22**

Thank you to everyone who's jumped in to help. We have about 38 participants so far. **We have plenty of shirts left!** Help us spread the word.

Thank you to redditor Thelittlestelf13 for starting a list of all of the families who have received little to no help so far. It shows the requestor username, number of kids and how many gifts each child has received. the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas goal is to reach 5 gifts per child!

Rubychan11,205,,251,1n0m19,,607,"CONTEXT: I work at everyone's favorite ""casual fast food"" burrito place in an outdoor mall.

Okay, so maybe this is petty, and I may get downvoted to hell for this, but I HATE it when customers get soda when they ask for a water cup. They are the sole reason that certain places have the fountain behind the register which, let's just be honest, is a huge inconvenience for everyone involved. Especially people like me, who like to mix 1/2 sprite, 1/4 orange hi-c, and 1/4 fruitopia... people just can't seem to wrap their heads around the proportions, and I feel like a bitch to ask, especially if they're busy. 

So anyway, right after asking one of my coworkers what I should do if this very situation arises, in walks Entitled Navy Douche (END). My town has two military bases in very very close proximity, and 90% of this military population are 18-21 year olds who flash their military ID to get out of speeding tickets and haven't known a day of REAL service (my boyfriend's father who is like a father to me just got bac from Afghanistan... the sotries he's told us would knock some decency into almost anyone).

After making a stink at the register because we're corporate and don't have a military discount (we don't have ANY discount, not even for other mall workers), saying shit like ""jeez, I protect the country and you can't even give me a free soda?"" he proceeds to get a water cup. In my head listening to this I'm thinking... dude. You look like you haven't even gone to basic. What are you, 18? 19? Like hell you protect the country. I bet you got that Navy sweatshirt from your JROTC commander.

I'm out in the lobby, cleaning tables and whatnot, and he's over at the drink machine. I kid you not, he glances RIGHT at me, then starts putting iced tea in the cup, obviously thinking I won't say anything. Nope. Instead, I walk over to him and very quietly so as not to embarrass him or make a scene, I say ""I'm sorry, sir, that's a water cup""

END, with a fake confused look, deliberately not looking at me: ""Oh, really?"" he looks at the side of the cup where it says ""water"" 4 different ways.

Me: ""Yep, it is, did you buy a drink and they gave you the wrong cup, maybe?""

END, still not looking at me: ""Well no... I just.. well I mean always get tea.""

I sit there staring at him for a good ten seconds until he looks at me furtively, then very, very slowly, he starts to pour the inch of tea out.

THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

(Bring on the military defenders and their downvotes! I have no fear--no karma for self-posts!)

Also, we're not talking like shitty ass Brisk or something that just comes from a syrup. We actually brew our own iced tea and everything, so the fact that this guy ""always"" rips us off really pissed me off.

The incident repeated itself a few moments later as she returned the tray to the kitchen window, but Jess ignored him again. The customer, seeming to realize that his attempt at flirting (?) was futile, went up to pay. 

Jess didn't want any of the servers to have to put up with this guy and went to cash him out herself. He pulled a 100 dollar bill from his wallet, despite having lower denominations in which to pay for his meal. Jess, per policy, held the bill up to the light. The customer huffed, ""That's offensive!""  Jess popped the drawer open, placed his change on the counter and stared him straight in the face before responding, ""So are you.""

SpyPies,22,,160,1nvv0c,,607,"For context I work at a chain cards/stationary/gift store. This occurred last winter. The winter holiday season is our busiest time of the year. But when the holidays were over, the stress and the stampeding crowds were not through with us yet, for it was time for the after-holiday sale!

Twas a day or so after christmas and the store was bedecked, bedazzled and befuddled with the after-holiday sales. Dust was shaken off old boxes of inventory and were dragged up from the basement, and excitable sale signs were generously distributed in abundance. Everything from halloween knickknacks to easter toys were put on display in hopes of starting the new year with a fresh(er) inventory. 

The deals, oh my the deals to be had.  

Enter a middle aged couple, nice looking folk. Just two of a few dozen or so shoppers pursuing our crazy miss-mosh of random this and thats. They come up to the easter display and see we're selling these big stuffed rabbits that were marked down to the gob-stopping price of something in the range of $2.50 a piece. 

""Do you have more of these in the back?"" They ask me. We were only able to cram 3 or so of those suckers on the table without reducing the whole display into a pile of fluffy goodness.

""We sure do."" I reply ""How many more would you like?""

""If it's possible, could you bring us all you have?""

They ended up purchasing about 4 or 5 giant bags of stuffed animals. Keep in mind, we had no shopping bags big enough to accommodate their purchase, we resorted to using these giant clear recycling bags (not those funky-smelly black fellas rest assured). They looked like they cleaned out a carnival. 

Curious, I asked them ""What are you guys going to do with all those toys?"" 

""Oh, we were going to [name redacted] hospital after this. Every year we try to give as many toys as we can afford to the children's ward.""

Thinkalil,86,,123,1hvf93,,606,"NOTE: I am black. 

I work at this fairly well known amusement park a couple miles from my hometown. I'm a ride operator so part of my job is to put the wristbands on the kids after we've checked their height. This normally takes the hassle out of getting your child's height checked at every ride that they go to. It's a great idea for those who don't want to wait in line for two hours and find out their kid is too short to ride. One of the rides I work at requires you to be 54 inches to ride - no less. 

So this white woman and her two small girls come walking up to my stand to get wristbands. The two girls both have HIGH HEELS on because they know that they are not going to be tall enough for the rides they want to get on so they're trying to cheat the system. I measure one of the girls with her heels on because she fell into the 48 inch range with or without the heels on. The other girl was about 50 inches without her heels on but was 54 with them on. So I tell her to take her shoes off so that I can't measure her without them. 

Me: ""Alright, darling, do you mind taking your shoes off so that I can measure you?""

The mother looks at her daughter and then looks at me. The daughter looks like she's about to cry because she knows that she's not going to be tall enough without them. 

Mother: ""Yeah, I think you're being really racist right now.""

I am shocked because I have never been called racist before and I'm thinking what kind of sheltered life do you live that anything a black person does to you that doesn't seem fair is racist. She says she wants to speak to my manager and I say I can call him for you and she just storms off to talk to the manager from the places that takes photos of people in the park. He literally has nothing to do with this situation but tells me to give her the 54 inch wrist band anyway. He kept looking at me the entire time like I was the one in the wrong and agreeing with all her BS about how I was being racist. I think he may have been trying to get her to leave but even so - I still don't see how I did anything wrong. 

These wristbands are for your kids safety. Not because we want to be mean. My ride has a strict 54 inch requirement because the harness around you has to be able to lock around your body. It does not have a floor to it so it makes the requirement necessary. I just can't believe the people that get upset over this kind of thing.

 She came up to me telling me they're out. I'm just said alright and your telling me why? She gets pissed saying ""I'm telling the manager"" and left as I responded ""that's nice?"".

She ended up dragging a manager over (I really do mean almost dragging, she was pulling on his sleeve) and pointed at me saying i was a rude, belligerent and useless employee. I just responded ""wtf are you talking about? I don't even work here"".

Bravesfan417,265,,293,1o2o5m,,606,"Hey everybody! Another story coming from my view as a customer while eating in a restaurant. This happened over the weekend, so I thought that I'd share with everybody and hopefully give you all a smile! Enjoy!

**Background:** I'm a 20 year old male, who hadn't shaved in a little while, so I looked near 23 or 24, while my date who I was out with is 19, but she looked to be about 14 or 15 with her makeup and her hair up the way she had it.

We walk into an Italian restaurant that's known for its unlimited breadsticks and salads (God I love this place...) Anyways, we walk in, I give them my name for the reservation, and we're taken back to our table.

Our waiter takes our drink order, and goes off while we talk and are having a great time. We're sitting across from each other, laughing like morons at the stories that we have to tell each other, and just in general having a great time. Our drinks are brought out and we order our food, again, no problems whatsoever. Our waiter is extremely nice and courteous, and even had a story to tell us even on a busy night like Saturday was.

We're about halfway through our meal, when an older lady walks up and this is how our conversation went.

Old Lady (OL): Awww... I think it's adorable that you take your younger sister out to dinner. Aren't you just the sweetest?

Me: Actually, this is Lindsay (name retracted), my date.

OL: Your... date? How old are you?

Me: I'm 20.

OL: That is absolutely DESPICABLE!!

Me: What do you mean, I'm only 20 and she's --

OL: You think that you can take out a girl this young and get away with it? Do you know what we call people like you??? You're a PEDOPHILE! You pedophile! Do you get off on going out to eat with girls 6 years younger than you??

At this time, everybody in our section is just looking at us. Lindsay is bright red, and on the verge of tears.

Me: Listen, I'm on a date, and while I don't mean to sound rude, and it's probably going to come out like that... Leave us the fuck alone. We're on a date.

The old lady walks out with her little cane-gang and our waiter comes over and apologizes for the incident.

Me: It's not a problem. But in case you're wondering, I'm only 20, and she's 19. I'm not a pedophile.

Waiter: I didn't think you were. Again, I'm sorry about that, and if you need anything at all let me know.

He walks out, and I keep getting death stares from other patrons as we continue our meal. Our conversations were a bit more subdued, no more laughing like two 10 year olds hopped up on sugar and soda.

We order some dessert, and I look up, and two cops are walking my way with this old lady at their heels.

Me: Son of a bitch....

Cop: Sir, we received a complaint that you're out to eat with a girl substantially younger than you are and we just want to make sure that nobody is going to get hurt.

Me: You have got to be fucking kidding me... Right? Let me guess... That older lady over there told you that I'm what... 23? 24? Something along those lines at that my date is what.... 15 or 16? I'm 20 freaking years old and she's 19. Now please, let us continue our date without anymore interruptions.

Cop: Son, if you can't be compliant then I'm gonna have to take you downtown to question you.

Me: Do you have any reason to detain me? Have I done anything wrong whatsoever? I'm sitting here, eating my food with my date, and y'all barge in like you own the place. Waiter... Can I get a check and some to go boxes please? I really don't feel like dealing with them tonight.

Cop: Sir... I'm gonna need you to calm down. Or you're going to go downtown.

Me: All you've done since you got here is threaten to take me in without asking for any evidence at all. Let alone asking me for an ID to figure this out quietly and discreetly you come in and make a big scene. I'm a loud guy, I don't get bothered by having everybody's eyes on me or being the center of attention. See my date? See how she's hiding her head? Yeah, she's the quiet shy girl. She doesn't like attention.

Cop: Let me see your ID.

Me: Fine.

I start to reach for my [wallet](http://cache14.indulgy.net/h8/92/t/fossilb0046h8tk6.jpg) which is kept in my front pocket and as I'm reaching for it (no quick or jerky movements mind you), he pulls his taser on me and tells me to stop what I'm doing.

Me: What the fuck!?!? You asked for my wallet, I'm getting it for you!

The cop reaches over and reaches into my pocket and grabs my wallet out for me.

Cop: Ma'am, can I see your ID please?

Lindsay reaches into her purse and grabs her wallet and shows the cop her ID.

Cop: Well... Would you look at that... He was telling the truth. I guess we can go.

OL: What?? You're going to let a pedophile go? This is an outrage!!

Me: Ummm... Officer? Can I get your name and badge number? You pulled your taser on me while I was trying to comply with what you did.

Cop: What are you gonna use it for?

Me: To complain to your superior officer. This was completely out of line. I did nothing to warrant this whatsoever. Your name and your badge number?

I copied down his name and badge number, we got out to-go boxes, I tried to pay the ticket but the waiter said that the manager had comped the ticket because of the trouble that we went through.

I left that waiter a $50 tip, and we went on our way. We went out to go play mini-golf, and once we got to the course, she started to not be so quiet and reserved, and she opened up again.

However, I got a text on Monday saying, ""Bravesfan417, I like you, I really do. I just don't want to go through what we went through on Saturday night again. Maybe if I start to look a little older than we can try again. I really am sorry!""

So... I'm not sure whether she was using that as an out to get out of us talking and possibly pursuing a relationship or whether that is a true reason as to why she doesn't want us to go out again and we might try later. I can definitely say that she looked quite sad on Monday in class and she still looked quite downtrodden today in class.

I really don't know what to say to her, but I hope that you all enjoy the story!

**EDIT:** I seem to be getting a lot of two different replies to this thread, so I'll answer them here to avoid having to answer them all seperately.

1. The way that the confrontation went down with the police is NOT why we did not go on a 2nd date. I texted her and asked and she told me that she still likes me, and that while I may not have handled that situation the best, again it is NOT why we're not going out on a 2nd date.

2. If you believe that my stories are not true or genuine, then you don't need to comment. I have no way of proving to all of you here at TFR that my stories are true. If you don't believe they are, you can leave me a downvote, and move on. I gain no comment by posting here.

Jozee378,81,,128,1h87uf,,607,"Okay, I posted yesterday but my power just went off so it reminded me of a story, wanna fight about it?

I worked at a beauty store when I was 18 ( 22 years now), and I thought it would be great! I loved makeup and I figured everything would be gumdrops and lollipops. No... Noooooo boy was I ever wrong.

People in my area are just plain moody and nasty. You get your usual happy go lucky type, but they are rare. It's gotten to the point where I didn't even try to make small talk anymore.

One fine Friday evening we had a severe summer storm. I was working the registers and the registers froze/shut off. we explained to our customers that if they wanted to wait for a few minutues they could, but if they had to run, we would hold their items for a day or two. 

Okay, most people handed their items to another cashier to hold them for an extra day. A few decided to look around, but bitchy bride to be and her posse of bridesmaids looked at us like "" are you fucking kidding me?""  I tell her the two options and she responds with "" Its always something with this store"" and I just tell her that I was sorry for the inconvience, but its a fucking storm. 

She then procides to tell me I better fix this and ring her up because she needs the makeup for the next day.  Um wtf am I supposed to do?  I just glare at her for a bit and tell her she's welcome to stand and wait.

Here's the great part, the storm wasn't letting up and I had 10 mins left. My mom decided to pick me up and came in the store to let me know she was there. I walked in the back to punch out and get my coat and when I walked back out my mom was talking to bitchy bride and bitchy bride saw me and started saying stuff she really shouldn't have. 

My mom ( who is a clinical director/ prof at a college)flagged me to come over and introduced me as her daughter, and bitchy bride as one of her students. 

Bitchy bride went pale. Mumbled sorry and walked out with her bridesmaids in tow.

thedictatorscut,91,,131,17c6wr,,609,"So as I've mentioned before, I work in a big shoe store in NYC's East Village. We get lots of tourist traffic in addition to our regulars. Today a woman comes up to my register who is clearly from out of town - very white, very Southern, looks kind of like Honey Boo Boo's mom. She hands me a shoebox and says ""These are scuffed, so I talked to the manager and they said y'all could take 25% off."" 

I'm immediately suspicious, because 10% is the most we'll ever give for a damage discount (if it's worth taking any more off, we'll just write it off as a damage and won't sell it). I look at the shoes and there's a tiny bit of wear on the bottom. Otherwise the ""scuffs"" are nonexistent. I say, ""Well, let me just call my manager over so that he can double-check it, okay? It'll just take a second.""

She starts to get huffy and goes, ""I already talked to your manager! They said it was *fine*! Y'all are trying to cheat me out of my money!"" I make up some BS about how I can't authorize the discount myself, the manager has to do it, and she seems to calm down for a second, until the MOD arrives. Now, the MOD today happened to be a guy we'll call Carlos, who could best be described as Stefon from SNL with a thick Queens accent. He's one of my favorite managers and everyone loves him, myself included, but he's the type of gay man I think half the country believes only exists in chick flicks and Ryan Murphy shows. Anyway, he shows up and asks what's going on, and I ask if he authorized a discount for the shoes. He says no, and looks at the nonexistent scuff marks before diplomatically asking the woman what the manager she supposedly talked to looks like. ""A white lady, brown hair,"" says the customer, and Carlos and I exchange a look. That describes exactly *one* of our managers, who has been out for the past week with the superflu. Finally, Carlos says that he can't give a discount for merchandise that isn't visibly damaged, and the lady loses her shit, yelling ""I DON'T CARE! Y'ALL ARE TRYING TO CHEAT ME! I WANT TO SEE THE MANAGER I TALKED TO, NOT THIS FAGGOT!""

And the chill that swept the cash wrap could have frozen the entire northeast.

Carlos, very quietly, told her to leave the store, and she threw the box on the floor and went on her way, ranting under her breath about how we need Jesus. And it was fucking glorious.

JacOfAllTrades,98,,142,17siae,,604,"My store has two notorious shoplift-then-returners, and today one wandered in with her husband and five-year-old child. I’ve watched this woman shove a duvet into her baby’s backpack, she has no shame. Because everyone working was involved, we’ll say Larry and Moe were the cashiers, Curly was the manager, Abbott (who is that cliché effeminate gay guy) and I were working on displays, and Costello was stock. On to the story!

The second Sticky Hands walked into the store, she shouted at Abbott and I, “Ay! One uh you gonna help me or what!?” I recognized her immediately. I walked over to her as she destroyed a bed display. She asked how much a duvet was, then the quilt, then the sheets, every sham, and threw each item into a pile in the middle of the bed as she “inquired” about it. After the bed was completely stripped, she asked where the sale bedding was, and I told her the back of the store. I was waiting until she was out of ear shot to warn the guys in the back, but Larry recognized her also, and was quicker on the walkie talkie.

Larry: Hey Moe and Curly, there’s a woman in a blue jumpsuit with a hat on and her belly hanging all out (yes, really) walking back toward you guys. She has her husband and kid with her, but you watch her like a hawk. She’s a thief.

Larry was actually supposed to be off the clock at that time, so she clocked out, then went to the back of the store to watch Sticky Hands. At first Moe and Curly just did the normal overly-helpful thing one does with shoplifters, but after about thirty minutes, Curly was getting annoyed. Moe had been doing a good job of not getting distracted. She was using the walkie to call for everything from stock to price checks, and never took her eyes off the woman. Curly came over the walkies and said, “This is ridiculous! She obviously isn’t buying anything, and she’s wasting all of our time!”

Oh Curly, you just don’t understand yet.

Me: Curly, it’s not what she’s going to buy, it’s what she’s not going to pay for, then return. She’s done at least $1300 worth of fraudulent returns that I know of. Do not leave that section. In fact, if everyone can be in that section, all the better.

Apparently Larry told him the same thing.

Abbott and Curly then decided the only displays that needed to be worked on were those in bedding, and Costello went over to “help Moe more quickly.” Basically (if anyone has seen a shoplifter, you will know exactly what I’m talking about), Sticky was asking bullshit questions about the bedding, and saying things like, “Go check in the back for this. Go in the back and check the price.” etc etc. Once all four were in the back, anything she asked, they all answered with different answers.

Sticky: Does this come in a queen?

Moe: Full/Queen.

Costello: No.

Abbott: I’m a queen! (Also, yes, really.)

Curly: They’re right behind you.

Every now and then Moe would call over the headset, “Hey, JacOfAllTrades, can you price check [item].” I told her $500 no matter what she asked. She made up random numbers.

This went on for about thirty minutes before Sticky finally admitted defeat and bought a sale duvet. This should be the end of the story, but it’s not.

Sticky and the rest of the Hands family went out the “back” door, and as they were walking back toward the front door in the mall hallway, I could hear her telling him off for not distracting us enough. He was useless, and they couldn’t get anything because he was so worthless. She then walked in the front door and directly up to my counter. She wanted to do a return. -.- Fine.

As I’m returning her item, I took the bag and threw it in the trash, and she immediately yells at me, “No! I want to keep the bag!”

Me: Sorry, ma’am, I can’t allow you to have a bag if you don’t have paid merchandise.

Sticky: That’s racist!

Me: No, ma’am, it would be racist for me to let you do it and nobody else.

Sticky: That’s bullshit! What if I need that bag!?

Me: For what?

Sticky: Other stores!

Me: I’m pretty sure other stores also have bags.

Sticky: This is the dumbest bullshit I’ve ever heard! Give me that bag back now! You're telling me the most bullshit!

Me: More bullshit than returning something less than five minutes after buying it?

Sticky: What the hell are you trying to say!?

Me: You know exactly what I’m saying.

Sticky: This is bullshit! You racist! I’m never coming back!

I finished processing her return as she thought of a hundred and one ways to tell me she was never coming back, because clearly a lack of retort meant I couldn’t hear her. By the time I handed her the return receipt, everyone but Moe had migrated to the front of the store and was watching this. Curly whispered over the walkie, “Say anything you want to her, we’ll all back you up.” Oh god. Don’t give me that kind of permission!

Sticky put the receipt in her pocket, and once again yelled at me, “I’m never coming back!”

Me: Okay, well then I have to ask, what do you do with the merch cards?

Sticky: What?

Me: I would think there would be an end point unless you could get cash for them. But if you get cash for them, I would think you could buy clothes that fit.

Sticky: What’s that supposed to mean!?

Abbott: *singing* You need to cover your belly! It’s disgusting!

Sticky: I want a manager!

Curly: I’m right here. *big smile*

ELTepes,86,,146,1kx8z8,,608,"Not entirely sure if this fits, but I've always found it to be a good story.

This is my first story here so I feel like I should preface it with a bit of information.  For ten years I worked a job that I made a lot of money at.  Working six months could easily cover the other six. There were occasions where I would go months without work. In order not to dip into savings and to save myself from boredom. I worked at a few places that didn't pay as well, but gave me cash to spend as living expenses were taken care of. Knowing that, you'll understand that I didn't care that much when someone decided to be a jerk to me. I would push back if it happened. I was never fired, which was amazing, but I never cared if I was or not.

One of these jobs was at a chain hotel franchise.  It was a horrible place to work. The owners were rude, meddling, and racist. The manager was a harpy, the long term employees were jerks and completely selfish, and because the chains members felt entitled to everything.

One particular instance happened during an Outage at the local nuclear plant. I'll save the first day of that for another story. Needless to say, it was a horrible month long event. I had been the recipient of multiple complaints for things that were in no way my fault (again I'll tell this one later). None of the complaint were considered formal though. To have a formal complaint, one had to be a member and call the member helpline for the hotel chain.

One particular customer came to the front desk on the second day of the Outage. At first his complaint seemed somewhat reasonable but then he got out of hand.

Man: I need a new mattress for my room. The one you have in there right now is bad for my back.

Me: I'm sorry, but I don't have any extra mattresses and they're all the same. I can talk to the manager, but she wont be in until Monday (she refused to work weekends).

Man: Just bring me another mattress from a different room.

Me: (somewhat surprised by this turn of events) Unfortunately, I'm the only one here so I can't leave the front desk for that long and as I said, they're exactly the same mattress, bought in bulk at the same time.

Man: I need a different mattress. I have a bad back.

Me: (by this point I no longer cared because I understood where all of this was going) I understand that. I think where we're getting hung up is you not understanding that I have no other mattresses. That's what I have, so you can take it or you could sleep on the floor.

Man: (visibly angry now, red face and everything) I don't have to take this! I can go stay somewhere else!

INTERJECTION
This threat was incredibly weak and we both knew it. There wasn't a hotel room available for an hours drive in any direction. The second he checked out, his room would be filled. He also had not paid for his room. It was paid for through whatever company he had come in with. They would not have paid for a second hotel room for him.
END INTERJECTION

Me: If you're not satisfied, your welcome to do that.

He then proceeds to huff and walk away. I go back to reading whatever book I brought that night because a full hotel meant most of my job for the night was done.

About twenty minutes later the phone rings.

Lady: This is REDACTED from REDACTED membership services and we've had a member complain that he needs a different mattress for his room.

Me: (I'm now in pissed off mode) Yes I remember. As I told him, there's nothing I can do.

Lady: You don't have any extras?

Me: In fact I do, but I'm currently using them to build a fort.

Lady: I'm sorry what was that?

I wasn't sure if she didn't hear me or if the phone cut out. I decided not to press my luck.

Me: No I do not have any extra mattresses.

Lady: Are you sure?

Me: (I'm starting to twitch from the stupidity of this) Yes, I'm sure I'm not secreting away imaginary spare mattresses.

Lady: Can you transfer one from another room?

Me: (getting a bit louder because I was about to pop) They're all the same. They were bought in bulk. I assume that's how most hotels do business, but apparently it's a foreign concept.

I hear a click at this point.

Lady: Oh well it seems that the customer hung up. I guess he'd heard that before.

Me: So are we done here?

Lady: Well because we were unable to resolve the issue I'll have to put a formal complaint in your file.

Me: So was I suppose to leave the building and go buy him a new mattress with the barely-above-minimum wage your company pays me?

Lady: Do you want to dispute the complaint?

Me: No, I think I'll leave it in there as a badge of honor.

Lady: You have a good day then.

Me: (finally calming down) You too.

DeathByCarousel,36,,117,1k085j,,603,"I did three years of retail. I am glad I am out of it. This is a little long and I am a little drunk, so sorry about this.

My story begins when I started working for that telecomm company. 

I was hired as an operations specialist, pretty much meaning that I handled the back office paperwork from the sales team, was in charge of the sales quota, among other things. Besides me, there were about 6-8 sales people and a manager, all hired under a contractor, meaning we were not directly hired by Big Telecomm. 

The story deals with the manager, who I will address to as Bill. Bill was a man that was full of tall tales, had a real bad temper and had horrible work ethics. The only part of his job that I remember was setting the schedule, arriving late and leaving early on most of his shifts, taking conference calls in which he'd be so angry about ""our numbers"" that he'd slam his fist on the desk or throw his pens around, and announcing that there were customers in the store. I'm serious, he went from ""Customer, customer"", to ""Consumer, consumer"", to ""Guest, guest"", whenever someone was in the store.

Fucking sad, really.

One of the things about my job that I hated was dealing with money. We never dealt with money, unless a client wanted to buy a modem or router from us, and usually that would be on card, not cash. In the extremely rare event that we took cash, I'd just fill out a form, put the cash in an envelope and hand it to the armored truck guy.

Here's where things went downhill. Bill got hired as an employee of Big Telecomm, meaning that he was a manager of the store but not in charge of us. This is good and bad. 

At one point, the powers that be decided that they will be running a promotion in which they'll be handing out free remotes for any customers that received an invitation. This could be a very simple transaction: Customer has a free remote voucher, they get a free remote and go home.

Bill somehow made a rule that every remote that was sent out should cost a penny because ""by law we shouldn't be giving stuff out for free"". So the sales people were literally charging a penny for a free remote, and if the customer didn't have it? No problem! We could throw in our own.

This became a problem because we started to pile up on pennies, and giving the armored guy that took the deposits a shitload of pennies in an envelope just didn't cut it. So Bill decided that we should just leave the pennies in the deposit box that was sitting next to our desks, no big deal, just a bunch of pennies in a box and no one would notice.

After a year and a half and a bunch of accumulated PTO, I was told that I need to take time off or I would lose all the PTO, so I took a week off. I was enjoying my time off at home, when one of my coworkers who was also one of my best friends called me and told me, ""Bill is trying to get you fired"".

I asked her why, and she told me that the district manager of our store stopped by to do a random inspection, and saw that there were a shitload of pennies on the safe that were not deposited. Even though I handled the deposits to the armored man, Bill's responsibility was to make sure that all deposits were sent in, and he was the one that told me that the pennies should not be deposited and just left in the safe considering how many there were.

I was not there to defend myself, so Bill threw the whole ""pennies"" idea on me along with the fact that they were not deposited. Along with that, I had been given the task of handling set top box returns, and our closet was full to the brim because we were not getting enough boxes in to send them out, and Bill's job was to order those boxes, which he virtually never did.

When I return back to work, everything was going fine. I was setting up the quota for the month, checking for work order errors, just doing my thing. The managers for the contractors, Mike, comes in and makes small talk with me and out of nowhere, he throws ""So DeathByCarousel, I really need another rep at our kiosk in this location, I really think you should take the position...""

Now mind you, I'm the ops guy. I do sales every now and then but only when it's so busy that the sales people need help. So I tell Mike to go out and have a smoke with me and talk about this.

We go out, light up, and he tells me that Bill is trying to get me fired, that he spoke to his bosses about getting me fired, but since I was a contractor, he couldn't fire me directly. Technically, Mike was there to fire me, but he told me that Bill was using me as a scapegoat for his incompetence and he was giving me the only two choices I had, which was to transfer to another place and work as a salesman. Or be fired.

Again, I had no choice. I thanked Mike for his kindness and told him I'd rather keep a job than not have a job at all so I'd transfer within a couple days. Mind you, I didn't tell anyone that I was transferring except for that coworker that I considered one of my best friends.

Bill comes up right next to me and asks ""Are the rumors true? That you're transferring?"". I was so pissed off, because I didn't say anything to anyone and apparently ""rumors"" were flying out already. I confirmed his ""rumors"" and he said he would miss me along with everyone else, that they would all miss me.

So I leave.

Now for the good part.

____________________________________________________

Not two weeks after I am doing my thing at the new place, selling like a madman and killing my quota, Mike stops by and asks me to come out for a smoke.

He tells me that there are four or five employees, along with himself that are trying to get Bill out of the other store. He asks me if I would be willing to have an interview with the Big Red higher ups about Bill's incompetence.

Of course I agree.

The day comes and I'm sitting in front of Bill's bosses. I tell them about Bill's anger issues when it comes to conference calls or when the numbers are just a little too low. I tell them about how Bill made a comment about how he got a gun and he could easily kill everyone in our team without emptying the chamber. I tell them about how when one of the sales reps fell asleep on the back after closing time, Bill was proud enough to bring said gun into the store because ""he was concerned to what he would do"". I told them about Bill's early leave, and late arrival, use of profanity with all the reps, inappropriate comments, and how I was used as the scapegoat for the clusterfuck with the safe and the returns. So many things that I don't even remember it all.

They thanked me for my time, apologized for the inconvenience and sent me my way.

Two days later, I heard that Bill came walking into the store, late as usual, yelling on his phone, and as soon as he walked in, he was pulled into the office to resign his badge and that he was done, and not to come back since he was banned from the store.

Serves you right, Bill.

Thanks for reading.

**Edit: Edited some typos.**

**Little epilogue:**

I had quit working at the new store about a year and a half after joining in due to lack of foot traffic, which meant decreased sales to the point in which we were on the red. Instead of getting reprimanded, I gave my two weeks and went to work at a call center for a competitor.

I get hired, go through orientation, and they introduce us to the team.

""Hello team, this is DeathByCarousel, who's joining us from Big Telecomm ""

""Hey DeathByCarousel, you're the second person that we have from Big Telecomm! Do you happen to know a man named Bill?""

My heart froze.

Bill worked there now. I don't know if he was aware that I was a big part of the reason why he got let go. Thankfully, Bill was on vacation when I arrived, and thankfully, he never came back. I did check the employee directory just to check that it was that Bill, and there he was.

A customer brought in two broken vacuum bags, said they were broken, and asked to exchange them for a new sealed pack of **5** bags. When I pointed out that tiny detail, he tore the new package open, slid 3 of the new ones and the two broken ones across the counter towards me, clutched the 2 new ones to his chest, and smugly smiled, ""Are we good here?""

To get the bags back from him I pointed out that the bags he got may not be the same ones as the one he had and asked if I could check for him to make sure he got the right ones. Unbelievably, he handed them right over. And the rest went like this:

MickCJ,67,,119,1eudiv,,600,"I've worked at the same store for 3 years. It's a small mom and pop store and besides the owners, I've worked there the longest of any employee they've hired. 

Two weeks ago the owners (my boss) hired a new kid. Normally this doesn't bother me but this kid has an attitude, you can just tell that he doesn't want to be there (not that people like to work, but he's blatantly lazy). For instance, my boss asked me to teach him the lottery machine (which, if any of you work with one, is pretty complicated). As soon as my boss walks away the kid goes, ""dude just do it for me."" 

We work together on Friday's. He tends to stock shelves and I run register because it's so busy. This is because he doesn't know he the register very well and because I have seniority over him. 

So it's a Friday and it's busy and I hear him yell from the back, ""MickCJ!"" I'm thinking he broke a bottle (it's a liquor store) which isn't a big deal. I get back there and he says, ""Can you help me put up these cases?"" I looked and he had 5 cases of wine to stock, which is nothing. I told him it's not that bad and I have to run register. Then it comes, ""you don't fucking do anything around here,"" he says. I turned around, ""excuse me?"" He responds, ""you heard me."" ""I've been here for 3 years. I've stocked shelves for 3 years. I've been where you are,"" I said. He comes back, ""all you've done is run register, I've done all the hard work!"" ""You're right,"" I said, ""I've been bored behind the register. And you know, when you're not here, I'm the one who stocks the shelves. You work one day a week. You need to learn your place or fuck off."" I just walked away after that. He yells from the back, ""fuck you!"" Now I'm not the type of guy to get angry a lot but this prick was pissing me off. 

Needed to get this story off my chest. I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about it. I don't want to tattle but this kid is just lazy and a bad employee.

StinkyMcPoopiePants,72,,148,1lrftn,,596,"Ok, so I spent 10+ years in retail, mainly in the back of house at a large housewares store. I didn't interact with customers much on the sales floor, though I was the stockroom manager so I did have a little authority.

I was closing one night, and while I was at dinner, my floor manager told me about this jerk that had just parked his big van in our customer pickup area, and even worse, he parked so that it took up both spots (and the rest of the mall parking lot was always a zoo, so we had to fight to protect these two spots). She had been letting another employee out the back door when this guy pulled in, and she asked if he was picking something up. He said he wasn't, he was doing some shopping, and she told him the parking spots were for customers picking up only. He then told her it wasn't his problem, and walked away.

When I got off my break, I took a look and he was still parked there, and must have stayed there for at least an hour. Any time another customer would come to pick something up, they had to park out in the middle of the parking lane, and block traffic, so it was a hassle. I thought about calling security, but it wasn't a really busy night, so I just kept a watch for the guy but didn't worry much.

In the meantime, a security guard came over and wrote him up. We didn't call him, as it turns out, he was flirting with one of the girls that worked at my store, so he was always looking for an excuse to hang around, in this case it was just dumb luck that he noticed the guy's van and wrote him up. Our mall security really didn't have any authority, so it wasn't really a ticket, more of a 'don't park like a douchebag' ticket.

Well, pretty soon this guy comes back to his van, after having parked there for probably 1 1/2 hours, sees the ticket, crumples it up and throws it on the ground. Instead of getting in his car, he walks towards our store entrance, cursing under his breath (I saw all this from the loading dock nearby where I was throwing the trash out). I quickly ran inside because I knew what was coming.

Yep, as I got onto the sales floor, this guy was laying into the night manager, telling her that he was pissed that she called security, that he wasn't paying any bullshit ticket, and that he was never shopping there again. His wife, meanwhile, looked like she wanted to crawl away and hide. The thing about guys like this, is that they do this all the time. They push the rules, or outright ignore them, then get mad when somebody calls them on it. By this time there were about 4-5 other employees around, as well as a couple of customers. The night manager was a sweet lady that didn't like confrontation, so she was trying to be nice, telling him that she didn't call security on him. He kept saying, ""This is bullshit!!!"", and that's when I stepped in.

""Sir, you need to stop. She did not call security, and I know that for a fact, nobody here did. And even if she had, she had already warned you that you couldn't park there and you did anyway""

""Who are you?"" he said, ""You don't know anything about this, so stay out of it"". 

""I'm the manager, and I do know, because she told me all about you parking there. I know that she warned you not to park there, and I know that the security guards roam around and keep a close eye on our back door pickup spot. I also know that it's not ok for you to come in here and curse at employees and abuse them, so you need to leave right now or I'll call the police!""

He got so mad at that, he turned brighter red than he already was, and then he tried pulling out his trump card, ""What's your manager's name? I'm going to call them tomorrow"" I told him her name, and that she was love to hear from him. I told him I would talk to her tonight and let her know to expect his call. He quickly turned around and stormed out, with his wife trailing meekly behind him.

I went back into the stockroom and was instantly surrounded by 5-6 employees all cheering at me, telling me how awesome that was. This wasn't like me at all, however. Like the title said, in over 10 years this was the only time I kicked someone out of the store, but it felt good. So good.

The employees consist of myself, another dude, and the owner runs all of the deliveries. That's it! Because there are only two of us, either I work open to close or he works open to close; that way we each get some days off for some relaxation. And since there is only one person at the restaurant, our jobs consist of; answering the phone to take down delivery orders, calling up the owner to tell him where the order is going, go back in the kitchen and cook/bag up the order, call owner to tell him you're done, go back to Reddit.

I called back to complain and I spoke with your morning manager. She said to bring the food back and she would replace all of the items free of charge. So I went up there and gave her the nasty ass food I was delivered but we had shit to do today so I asked if we could just get our replacement order later tonight and he said it was okay. So now I'm calling to get my food.

Me: Sir what time did all of this take place?

SC: Around 11 o'clock this morning. 

I knew his story was bullshit from the beginning but I couldn't tell him I was alone in the restaurant. The last thing I needed was for him to come down and rob me or something crazy. He had just given me another reason to call him out and deny him service.

I used to work graveyard at a convenience store. In Portland, Oregon where beer hour was 2:30 am. This incident happened around 3:15 am. I was 24 when the incident occurred.

At that time of the night I would empty and clean the coffee pots in back because the service industry workers would have come and gone, the workout warriors wouldn't start trickling in for another half hour and the cabbies wouldn't start filtering in until four. Few people came around then so I left the door open, the back was next to the front door I could easily pop out when I heard the bell. 

On this particular night I was engaged in some heavy scrubbing of one pot in particular which had a great deal of grim in it's nether regions. The bell rings and I yell 'Just a sec!' set the brush down and take a moment to dry off and such. I figured it was just someone looking to buy smokes or a street walker looking for condoms or ho-hos (yeah, they do actually buy those).

Directly across from the door to the back, all the way on the far wall, is the wine rack. I exit the back and see some kid, no more than 16, shoving bottles of wine down his pants whose cuffs are tucked into his socks. Just shoving them down there one after another. Outside his two friends are in what I assume is a parent's car laughing their asses off. None of them has seen me. I just stand and watch this kid fill his pants up.

The kid gets all he can carry, turns to the window that looks into the parking lot and he raises his hands in triumph. I see his two buddies in the car do the same. Smiles all around. Good teenage tomfoolery accomplished.

As he turns to go he sees me. He smiles some and calmly asks “Oh, hey. Can I get a pack of Camel Lights?” Shit eating grin and all. 

Then he starts walking to the counter. 

&lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt;

“Put the wine on the counter.” I say.

“I don't have any wine.” his confidence is starting to erode. 

I walk to the front door and lock it. Reach around the lipstick display and lottery machine and grab the phone.

Kid starts to freak out. “Ohm mmgawd nuw! Here!” He starts fishing out all of the wine from his pants. I look out the window and see his friends freaking out in the car.

All the wine is on the counter. Kid shakes his pants to show me he's clean.

“You got anything else of ours in your pants?” I ask.

“No sir.” he looks down sheepishly.

His friends outside are talking amongst themselves hurriedly. I assume they are debating whether or not to abandon their friend. I should have called the cops- we had a number of patrol officers personal numbers for these sorts of situations, no need to bug 911 and better response time- but for some reason I was feeling lenient.

“Get out of here and don't come back.” I unlocked the door.

Kid took two steps and stopped. “Uh, well...could I still get those Camel Lights?”

GNPunk,51,,148,1i45tr,,591,"Most of my adult life has been spent working in some form of customer service, sales, or retail hell.  My story today comes from my first year working in a ""Big Box Retail"" store that carries all sorts of electronics.  I no longer work there, but in the five years combined that I worked in this store, I have amassed many stories involving employee hilarity after hours, manager douchebaggery, but the best of all:  Stupid customers.

This story is easily my favorite.

**Black Friday, 2005
Location:  Car Audio Department**

I've been employed part time for roughly six months.  I knew absolutely nothing about Car Audio other than the major brands were Pioneer and Alpine for head units.  Over that time, I became more familiar with amplifiers, 1/2 or 1 farad capacitors, installation of subwoofers, speakers, and many other things.  However, our department was still mainly for the basics:  Head units that could handle the ridiculous boom of iPod users wanting to listen to their playlists in their car.

Black Friday in retail....I wasn't prepared for it.  Even in the afternoon, people were nothing short of insane.  After dealing with six of them, I will never go back.  On this day, though, a little blonde female college student gave me all the reason to stay in retail with her sheer stupidity.  The conversation went like this:

**Me**:  How can I help you today, Miss?

*Her*:  I need a new car radio for my 2002 Honda Civic!

(Sidenote, the area I live in is near one of the largest Honda plants in the country, so Honda pretty much dominates the demographc)

**Me**:  Alright, well you can pretty much pick whatever you want, but what do you need it for specifically?

*Her*:  Well, I have an iPod, and I want to be able to play it through my radio.

**Me**:  No problem.  Most of the decks in the mid to high price range have two options for iPods.  You can either buy an Apple Interface Cable (They went for about 100 bucks at the time....ridiculous, when you think about it) and it will power and charge the iPod.  The second option is to get one that uses the AUX slot in the front.  It doesn't charge it, but it's quick access and cheaper so you just plug it in the front.

*Her*:  Oh okay!  Like this?


Now...I'd like to think that most people have good common sense.  However, there is an occasional person out there that I run into which makes me lose faith in humanity.

This girl takes her iPod out of her purse and, as I point at one of the radios that has the AUX port, completely ignores that and attempts to put the iPod into the CD slot sideways.  After a couple of failed attempts, I blankly stare at her and finally respond.

**Me**:  Miss...you don't put it in like that...""

*Her*: Oh!  Like this?

She then turns it length-wise....and tries to do it again.

At this point, I have to laugh, but I stifle it and tell her I will be right back, going to the front of the department and grabbing one of the other guys, who watches her CONTINUE TO TRY AND PUT IT IN THE CD SLOT.  He takes over and I go to the warehouse....and proceed to lose it.  The Inventory Manager, who never smiled unless he had a beer in his hand, hears the story, and responds with the simplest, yet funniest thing I've heard him say.

Although I wasn’t a cashier, often times I would fill in when the cashier would go on lunch or for smoke breaks. The part of Brooklyn I worked in was colorful to say the least and I had to deal with my fair share of crazies, but one man in particular stands out to me.  I shall refer to him as “CD”, short for crazy dude.

So CD comes up to the register and asks for a pack of cigarettes, which I get out and then proceed to ask him if he will be paying with cash or credit. “Credit”, CD says. Ok cool, easy enough, right? Oh no! CD hands me one of those plastic credit cards you get in the mail with promotions from the bank that say “Your name here” and have a numbers like “1234567890” and are just obviously not really a credit card.  I look down at the card and know this is going to be a rough time. 

“Sir” I said, I cant accept this as payment.
“Why”? CD asked defensively
“Because this is not a real credit, it’s a card you get in a mailing asking you to sign up for a credit card, it doesn’t even have a magnetic strip for the machine to read”
“No, it’s real” CD says in an annoyed tone. “Just swipe it”

So I swipe this damn card, obviously to no avail. CD is getting increasingly agitated that the machine is not taking his “credit card”. 

“I’m sorry sir, this card doesn’t work, it’s not a real card” I say again. I even try to reason with him and explain why his card cannot be used for payment and that  maybe he got confused and took the wrong on out of his wallet. I ask if he has cash or a different card on him, he doesn’t.

“Run the numbers” he demands. I oblige, obviously this is never going to work. I call over my manager who sees the absolute stupidity of the situation and also tries to explain to him why we can’t take his “card”, this insanity continues for about fifteen minutes.

Finally, the cashier comes in and sees what is going on, and in a streak of genius he offers to the guy that our competitor down the block has better prices on cigarettes and they for sure will be able to take his credit card as payment because obviously our machine must be broken.

yessircapntightpants,69,,110,1qk546,,587,"I used to work for a video store, which is this thing that used to exist that was kinda like Netflix, except a Netflix you could walk inside.  I was a Shift Leader (one step below assistant manager) and was working with my coworker, whom we'll call Dave, on a very busy Friday night.  Dave was the sweetest, most mild-mannered person I ever met.  Chipper and mellow and genuinely happy to be doing his menial, thankless job.  

Friday nights at the video store were always a chaotic mess from about 6:00pm to 10:00pm.  Huge lines of people wanting movies for their weekend viewing pleasure, and a very limited number of cash registers and employees to ring them up. The store I worked at had a fantastic Store Manager, and as a result, incredibly low turnover. Everyone there knew what they were doing, and we moved the crowds out fast, provided no customer insisted on being difficult and taking up a register for ten minutes while they tried to figure out what phone number or name they put their account under or something like that. 

So one particularly crazy Friday Dave and I are working the registers up front, doing our usual hustle to get through the hordes of movie-renters, when in walks The Horrible Bitch (THB from here on out).  She had the sort of tan that one can only achieve by laying around and barking orders at the pool boy all day, every day.  Her bleach blonde hair was teased to near-Jersey Shore levels, and her acid-wash skinny capris screamed, ""I regret becoming an adult and am actively attempting to revert to my teenage years, despite clearly pushing 40.""  The dead, yet somehow angry, look in her eyes was both haunting and repulsive.  She had three boys with her, ranging in age from roughly four to nine-years-old, and she gave the impression that motherhood was the worst decision she ever made.

She didn't bother us while picking out movies, and while she was curt and generally shitty to Dave while he rang her up, she wasn't an exceptionally bad customer. Dave was his usual sweet self, and managed to get her rentals in order while she alternated between rolling her eyes at him, making heavy sighing noises before answering questions, and screaming at her kids to PUTTHATCANDYBACKRIGHTNOW!  

If you work retail, you know that these sorts of customers barely phase you.  Sure, they're unpleasant, but if they're not actively yelling at you and causing a scene, you just kinda assume they had a bad day and try not to make it any worse.  Dave handed her the movies she rented and wished her a pleasant evening as she left, and then went back to ring up the next customer in the incredibly huge line. 

Less than thirty seconds later THB angrily storms back in, clearly looking for something.  Dave sees her and asks if she forgot something, and she snaps that she left her keys on the counter.  Dave checks the counter, and also the space behind his register and around the cash-wrap, but doesn't see any keys. While still ringing up other customers, he asks me and the other people working that night if any of us have seen a set of keys.  No one has.  A couple of helpful, generally nice people waiting in line even hear this and do us a solid by looking around the front area (since we can't really come around when there's a huge line of customers).  No one sees any keys. 

Dave is trying to helpful, but he has other, less horrible customers who need his attention, so THB winds up storming around the cash-wrap area, searching for her keys amongst the display cases that line the registers. This wouldn't be a problem, except that she's searching by pulling all the product down from its neatly organized POP space and just leaving it in piles on the floor or the counter. We're busy, and she's clearly ready to explode, so we don't even try to stop her.  We both know it'll be easier to just clean up her mess than it would be to try and reason with her.  

After tearing our cash-wrap displays apart, she starts loudly accusing us of hiding her keys out of spite.  Maybe she's seen Clerks, and maybe she's fully aware that she's an unpleasant bitch to the Plebians that ring up her purchases, but she's become absolutely certain that we threw her keys in the trash. She demands that we dig through the trash RIGHTTHISSECOND and give her back her keys. We explain that we haven't seen her keys, and we certainly didn't throw them away. Dave even takes a moment away from his register to show her the small trash bin we keep up front, which is almost empty and clearly doesn't contain any keys. 

THB is not satisfied.  She wants us to check the big, outdoor trash can by the door.  Despite the fact that her truck is parked right in front of the store, and that no one could have thrown her keys away in that can without her seeing them, she is insistent that we drop everything and go pick through the garbage. Honestly, if it were a slow time and there weren't any other customers waiting, one of us probably would have thrown on some gloves and just done it. Years of retail make you highly likely to do something you know is stupid, because it's always easier than trying to convince a customer that their request is, in fact, stupid.  It's Friday night though, and there's no way we're closing a register to placate her obvious personality disorder. 

She storms out again, and Dave looks out the window a minute later and informs me that she has dumped out our outside garbage, right in the middle of the sidewalk, and is forcing her children to dig through it.  Nothing like adding a little child-labor to your harassment of innocent retail clerks to really take things up a notch.  He mentions that she's probably going to leave that mess there, and he's not wrong.  THB gets a cab or a ride home from someone, so the next time we look outside she's gone, leaving only a pile of video store garbage and her shiny new truck in her wake. 

Later that night, after close, we're doing our standard restocking and straightening of the concessions out front, when Dave yells for me.  I look up and he's pulling a set of keys out one of the candy bins.  The same candy bin that THB's child had been digging through before she started screaming at him like a volatile harpee. Now, I don't know if said child just happened to drop the keys and forget, or if it was purposeful revenge for the screaming, or if he realized that he'd dropped them but was too terrified of his psychotic mother to speak up, but either way, her keys had been there the whole time.  

Without a word Dave took the keys and walked out to the parking lot, where THB's shiny new red truck was still stranded.  Because Dave was such a nice guy, I assumed he was going to toss them in the back and maybe throw a note on the windshield or something.  Instead, I watched him hold the keys in his hand and slowly gouge a scratch from the back of the tailgate to the front headlight, and then throw those keys in the same trashcan that THB has upended during her rage.  

He walked back in, saw me staring and said, ""Bitch made me pick up garbage. Fuck her and her keys."" And with that he quietly resumed his closing duties.

Man on Phone: ""Oh, hi, yes, um, I have a question...""

Me:  ""Sure, what can I do for you?""

MOP: ""Um, well, I was wondering if I could come in and purchase a, um, dress... for... myself.  I was wondering if, um, I could try them on.""
*Our store had no set policy on letting men shop in the store for themselves, but we always welcomed any customer, because hey, their money is just as green as anyone elses!*
Me: ""Of course, my best advice is to come by this morning or tomorrow morning while we don't have many customers in the store.  If there IS another woman using the fitting rooms we will have to ask you to wait until she's finished, but otherwise it's not a problem.""
*We had a back room where our fitting rooms were, with 5 smaller ones and a larger handicapped room towards the end of the hall*

I told him my name, and that to ask for me if he'd like to come into the store and shop.  He thanked me and our conversation was over.
I didn't think anything of it, as we get phone calls from men who cross dress, but very few acutally come IN to the store to try things on.  They usually ordered online, or bought some items and returned the ones that didn't work.  Because we were a plus sized store, our clothes were obviously bigger and longer which would fit more men, than having them shop in a clothing store that had smaller sizes.  I continued to organize various things as we were very slow in the mornings.
About 30 minutes later an older gentleman with bright white hair, in a large windbreaker and khakis comes strolling in.  I greet him as I usually would any customer, and he quietly aproached me.

MOP: ""Are you... Cassiethesassy?""

Me: ""Yes, I am!  Did you call earlier?""

MOP:  ""Yes, I did... I was hoping you'd help me pick out a dress.  I like to wear them around the house.""

Me:  ""Not a problem, was there something certain you had in mind?""

We continued to talk about what he was looking for.  He was on a budget, and our full priced merchandise was a bit more pricey than a discount retailer, averaging about $70-100 for a new dress.  So, I escorted him to our clearance section and decided he would fit best in a 1X size.  He picked out a few that he liked and asked if he could try them on.  I obliged as we had no other customers in the store.  I unlocked the farthest fitting room (just in case we did get another customer), and as I let him in with the items he said: ""Will you stick around and give me your opinion?""

Me: ""Sure, just let me know when you're ready.""

I let him get settled and when I heard my name I knew he had the first dress on.  
He had picked some rather, LOUD patterns (as many plus sized clothing makers insist on making), but as he tried them on I gave him my honest opinion.  Between dresses he would drop down to his undergarments in front of me.  When I say *undergarments* I mean he had a red, stuffed bra on and matching red panties.  Everything was covered, but needless to say, I learned a pretty good poker face that day!
He tried on about 4 different dresses and decided on a green, satiny number with a black swirly pattern across it.  As he was changing back into his clothes, he looks at me, hands me a $10 bill and says: **""Wow, I wish I had a girlfriend as nice as you.""**

Needless to say, it was a very sweet compliment, but a bit out of the usual for myself.
He paid for the dress, thanked me again and went about his way.  Amazing what a little understanding and kindness can do for someone's day, plus, hey!  $10!!

**TL;DR: Cross dressing man tipped me $10 for helping him try on dresses during my shift at a woman's plus sized clothing store.**

I ask if I can help him find anything.
Guy: ""Yeah, you got any rope?""

""No, sorry we don't carry any.  But Ace down the st-""

""Really?  No rope?""

""No, we do not carry any rope""

""None at all?""

""Sir ... we do not carry any rope products.  Our larger store in &lt;nearby city&gt; does, otherwise you will have to check elsewhere.  There is an Ace Hardware right down the street.  They might have something you are looking for""

I'm already sick of him asking the same fucking question until he gets the answer he's magically looking for.  ""Oh jee willikers, I just pulled some magic rope out of my fucking Mary Poppin's ass!  Here, have some!  On the house!"".

I guess repeating the hardware store's name three times finally worked, because he asks me where it is.  I gesture in the direction, ""down this street, on the right""

""Where at?""

""You go down this street ...""

""Okay but WHERE""

... ""You see this building outside?  On the other side of that.  Right hand side of the street""

At this point, he ends up pointing up a completely different street, 90* from where I'm directing him, and says ""Up the street, right side?""

avdotya_zharkov,179,,179,1krlzp,,590,"Hello TFR! I recently started lurking and decided to put up some of my own retail stories. Here goes!

**Preface:** I have been working at a movie theater for almost a year now and I don't have one particular position in the theater. So, depending on how my managers set the schedule, I can go between being in the box office for one shift, concessions for my shift the next day, and being an usher for my shift at the end of the week.  

Now, as far as my theater is concerned, we have very specific rules for rated R movies. To see a rated R movie, an individual has to be 17 years old with a valid ID OR have a parent/guardian that is 21 years or older with a valid ID to let multiple people in on the movie. That parent/guardian then must watch the movie with the people they brought in, or else the underage people in the theater will be kicked out without a refund. 

**Storytime:** For this certain event, my shift has me up in box office, where I help guests buy their tickets and card people if I need to. I was quickly going through the long line of guests we had for a particular rated R movie.

Then three guests come up to my register: a rude mother, who we'll call RM, her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend. 

**Me:** Hi, what movie are you guys here to see? 

**RM:** I'd like two tickets for *rated R movie*.

**Me:** Alrighty! Who's going to see the movie with you today? 

**RM:** Actually, I'm just buying the tickets for my daughter and her boyfriend. 

**Me:** Unfortunately, ma'am, I will have to check their IDs or you will have to buy a ticket for yourself and watch the movie with them because the movie is rated R. 

Her daughter take out her ID and hands it me so I can check it. Meanwhile, her daughter's boyfriend is having no luck in finding his ID in any of his pockets. 

**Me:** I'm sorry, but I can't allow him in because he doesn't have his ID.

**RM:** WHAT!? What if -I- buy his ticket for him? 

**Me:** You would still have to sit in with him to watch the movie  because he doesn't have his ID on him. I have no way of making sure that he is 17 or older so he can watch the movie by himself.

**RM:** THIS IS **FUCKING** RIDICULOUS, DOES HE LOOK UNDER 17 TO YOU?!

**Me:** Yes, he does, ma'am. We are required to card anyone who looks under 25 for any rated R movie. If you were to watch the movie with them, that wouldn't be a problem at all. 

**RM:** I don't want to watch the fucking movie! I've NEVER had to deal with this at another movie theater! I want to see your manager! 

**Me:** Actually, he's standing right next to me. 

I look at my supervisor, who has seen the entire ordeal because he is helping us with the line, and have him repeat our entire policy to her.

She then says she going to another movie theater in the area because ""they don't card for rated R movies,"" and storms out of the theater. 

**TL;DR:** Mother tries to buy rated R movie tickets for her daughter and daughter's boyfriend, doesn't work, mother flips out on me, nearby supervisor repeats what I said, mother walks out. ",Sorry that your daughter's boyfriend needs an ID to prove he's 17 or older...,769,talesFromRetail

I had a visit from one of my regular clients two days ago, and it's still on my mind.  Our stylist/client relationships are more personal than some other fields, these things affect us.  Those of us with any sense of compassion, anyway.

She's in her late sixties, early seventies maybe.  It's her third round with cancer, the leukemia has returned after 11 years of remission.  She calmly tells me during her blow-dry that her doctor has stopped her chemo.  She calls it a ""super-bug"" - the chemo is no longer treating it, only killing the rest of her cells.  There are no other options available.  She might have three years, she might have three weeks.  She doesn't know.

I remain silent while she speaks.

She tells me that she wants four years, to make it to her 50th wedding anniversary.  She's spending time with her family, taking each day as it comes, *living*.  All of this in a calm, collected voice, as if she's talking about the weather.  She's made her peace with it.

I don't know how she does it, really.  Having never been in her situation, I can't say how I would react, not that she expects a reaction, pity, anything.  It's a fact of her life now.  She thanks me, pays her (discounted, because she really is one of my favourite clients) bill, and leaves with her husband.

I walk into the back room, out the back door, and stand in the rain.  I don't know if I should cry, or scream, or curse someone or something.  It's not fair.  She's a good person, shse doesn't deserve this.  Then again, who does?

The rest of the day is a blur of clients and services.  When I am alone, closing the store at the end of the day, the phone rings.  It's her.  She has a favour to ask of me.

She wants me to style her hair for her funeral, when the time comes.  If the funeral home will allow it, of course.  Would I be able to do something like that?  If not, she understands.  It's not an easy task, she says.

The tears are running down my face in torrents now, like the rain on the front windows.  I struggle to keep my voice from shaking, to not let her know this is hurting me terribly.

Of course I will.  If the funeral home allows it.  She thanks me, bids goodbye, and hangs up.  I sit there at the desk, still crying and staring out the window at nothing.

After a long string of horrible customers, I began working with an elderly customer.  She told me that it was her granddaughter's birthday and that she wanted to send her a card.  The granddaughter did *alot* of texting and she wanted the card to be special.  She showed me the message she wanted for the card but wanted it to be in texting lingo and she didn't know any. 

I worked with the woman for about 15 minutes crafting the letter and explaining where things like, ""Let's replace this 'Lots of Laughter' with LOL and change the 'you are special'  'URSpshl'.  It was the most relaxed, care free, and creative, I had been in a long time.

McFeely_Smackup,55,,122,1hkn4r,,588,"The software/game store I used to manage was across the street, a busy 4 lane one, from a place that sold everything from appliances to software.

One time on my lunch break I went over to this place because I was looking for a new kitchen stove, and the store manager approached me and asked if I worked at the store across the street. I thought we were about to have a moment of retail management camaraderie and so said yes, I was the manager over there. He then accused me of ""sneaking"" into his store and writing down their prices so we could undercut them. I tried to explain I had nothing to write anything down on or with, and was looking at kitchen appliances not software, but he was adamant and told me if I returned to his store I'd be trespassing.

Well unfortunately for them, they had a price matching policy of not just matching, but beating other prices by 10%. So from that day on, any time they called for a price check (that was their way to verify prices at the time), I'd tell them our price was like half of what it really was. The guys who worked at my store would buy everything from them because they'd get a better deal even than their employee discount.

One time they called to ask about a US Robotics modem and I gave some ridiculously low price and the guy was like ""OH COME ON!"" knowing he was being scammed, but also having a customer standing in front of him smiling smugly. Seconds later I see a guy dashing across 4 lanes of traffic from there, dodging cars with horns blaring, coming to check the price. It was the same dude who had threatened to have me arrested. I met him at the door and told him that per our previous conversation, I had not returned to his store and he was not welcome in mine. 

He had to dodge cars back across the street and I concentrated and focused my will, attempting to telekenetically trip him under a bus, but it didn't work. I don't know if he sold the modem at 60% off or not.

millondefloss,99,,135,1n7hn4,,588,"An unexpected side-effect of selling mobile phones has been a lessening of my tolerance for people using their phone at inappropriate times. Crossing the road? Eyes off your phone! Driving a car? Put the phone down, you tool! But what absolutely infuriates me are people who pay more attention to their phone than to their toddler. Here are a few instore examples that had me seething for hours.

1. This one happened at store front. About a meter from the door, I could see a child of approximately three years old, crying his heart out and screaming for his mum. I make a beeline over - and I can't spot anyone looking for him in the near vicinity. I start to panic, and consider bringing the kid into the store. Then I see her - pushing her buggy, engrossed in her phone, 20 METERS AWAY. I stand near the child to make sure he isn't at risk. She halts, looks at the phone for another twenty seconds, and ONLY THEN does she take a look around for her child. She spots him and strides over, grabs him by the arm and starts pulling him down the road, telling him what a bad boy he was to frighten her like that. Mother of the fucking year, right there.

2. It's a busy day, and there's a bit of a queue. I briefly spot as father and his little girl come in, but it doesn't properly register. After a few minutes, out of the corner of my eye I see the girl attempting to shin her way up one of the chairs. The chairs aren't bolted to the ground, they are very wobbly, and above all, they are really heavy. I spring away from my till mid sentence, and get there just in time, managing to grab the chair before it landed on the little girl, who had taken a tumble. She wasn't crying, and I helped her up, told her that she shouldn't play on the chairs because she could hurt herself, and that she should go and stand with her dad. She nods, and toddles off. I look over - the father has completely missed the entire incident as he was too engrossed in his iPhone to keep an eye on his daughter. Luckily, she was ok, but how many people agree that if she HAD got hurt, the father would have blamed the store?

3. My own personal favourite. My colleague was dealing with a couple who had come in with their two kids. As soon as my friend started processing the upgrades, the couple left the kids to entertain themselves. I think they assumed the older one would look after the little girl, who couldn't have been more than two. Only two issues with this. The older child was six, and we have iPads. I fielded that little girl as she ran out the door onto a busy main street 4 times. Did they at any point notice what was happening? No, of course they bloody didn't. The prospect of a new smartphone was far more enticing than making sure their child wasn't at risk! As I trailed back into the store for the final time, her cheese puff stained little hand in mine (shudder), they turned round and looked at me as though I was doing something wrong. In the end, I took her over to them and this time made sure they had a proper hold on her. The mother turned round and shouted at the six year old for not keeping an eye on her.

**A**: Doing what on purpose?

**C**: Not running the lift because of the weather!

**A**: Uhmm No. These are restrictions from the manufacturer. We dont make them, we cant change them for security reasons. It would be quite stupid from us to close the lift even though we could still run it, dont you think? I mean we make money from people using the lifts!

---

I came to the US when I was 9 years old with my parents from the former USSR, and hence speak fluent Russian, however you would never know from speaking to me since my accent is practically nonexistent thanks in part to my being so young when we moved. 

When I was 17 I got my first (official) job as a cashier at ShopRite. For those not on the east coast of the US, ShopRite is a supermarket chain here. 

So, it's a particularly non eventful day of normal cashier work. People get on my line, I scan their shit, I bag their shit, I tell them how much money they spent, and they give me money to stuff the register. 

At some point this Russian woman and her 20ish year old son get in my lane. I finish ringing up the customer before them and the following conversation ensues.

&gt; *Me: (To previous customer) Have a nice day.*

&gt; *Me: (To Russian woman) Do you have a ShopRite card?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

&gt; *Me: Do you have any coupons or rain checks?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

I then begin scanning her groceries. Note that as far as she's concerned, it has been established that I speak flawless English.

&gt; *Woman: (to her son) Посмотри что этот идиот делает. (Translation: Look at what this idiot is doing)*

I glance up trying to find the idiot she is talking about. Perhaps something funny is going on?

&gt; *Woman: Почему он здесь работать? Бог Я ненавижу идиотов. (Translation: Why is he even working here? God I hate idiots.)*

At this point I realize she is talking about me. Mind you, all I am doing at this point is taking her groceries, waving them over the scanner, and putting them aside to bag later. I'm not banging them or taking a long time or anything. I was doing a pretty decent job of it actually. 

I begin to run the situation in my head and decide that it's best to just continue working and ignore the woman... for now. So I put on my best smile and keep scanning her shit.

&gt; *Woman: Сколько это еше займет? (Translation: How long is this going to take?)*

I finish ringing up all her stuff, punch up her total and begin bagging. Normally I would have asked how she would like to pay at this point, but I decided I would let her throw in a few more insults first.

&gt; *Woman: Он даже не знает как правильно упаковать. Ой, какой идиот. (Translation: He doesnt even know how to pack correctly. Oh, what an idiot.)*

She managed to throw in a few more insults my way, calling me some very colorful things in Russian. I made sure to pack all of her things away with a smile, and then replied:

&gt; *Me: Как вы будете за это платить? (Translation: How will you be paying for this?)*

The woman stops dead in her tracks, her eyes open wide in a moment of horror and for a brief moment our eyes lock. I smile an even bigger smile, as gentle as I can possibly muster, under the circumstances. Her son even took a step back. After what must have felt like an eternity for her, she hung her head in shame and handed me her credit card. I rang her up, handed her the credit card back, and handed her son the remaining groceries. Both of them are completely red in the face at this point and both refuse to say anything. Their eyes are firmly locked on to the floor. As they leave, I smile at them again and say:

&gt; *Me: Большое спасибо. Пожалуйста, приходите еще. (Translation: Thank you very much. Please come again.)*

Now the cherry on the icing happened almost 6 months after the incident. The son happened to get on my line with whom I assume was his father. They were speaking Russian to each other and didn't pay much attention to me. But I recognized the son. After I was done scanning their things, I pause, put on my smile again and say to the son:

&gt; *Me: Я вас помню. Как вы поживаете? (Translation: I remember you. How are you doing?)*

The best part wasn't the son's look of terror when he realized I was the same cashier that caught his mother being a cunt. It was the same look on the FATHER'S face, and the subsequent look of shame and insistence on looking at his shoes and not speaking. Obviously the story of his wife's antics reached his ears at some point, and they all remembered even 6 months after the fact.",Being bi-lingual sometimes has unexpected benefits.,651,talesFromRetail
namepoc,43,,117,1mymox,,582,"I remember this incident from about two years ago; it amazes me to this day how some people act. 

I was working the till in my shop, it wasn't too busy about three or four customers and just after lunch time. 
An oldish lady walks in and comes up to the desk ""Hats, I need a hat."" I thought it was quite rude how she asked but I still pointed them out to her. 

She then decides to wander over to the DVD's, not sure why but knocks a woman over getting through the small gap by the rail of clothes. She then pushes another woman to the right to see the DVD's without politely asking her to move. I noticed the customers were getting aggravated; especially when she knocked a child's dress off the rail and says to the customer; ""Pick that up!"" I was shocked and went over and asked her if there was something I could help her with.

She says to me ""I need a mirror to see the hat, where is your mirror."" I said to her that our mirror was in the changing room but she'll have to wait as there is someone in there trying something on. 

I walked back to the counter to serve a customer who seemed eager to buy and get out, I apologised to the customer, when suddenly I hear a gasp. 

I look up and the elderly woman had pulled open the fitting room curtain to reveal a customer who was practically naked and was saying to her ""I need to see the mirror!"" I went over to quickly close the curtain. Took the hat off the woman and banned her from the shop. The customer getting changed was very shocked about what had happened; I felt so bad as I am sure some of the other customers had seen her nearly nude. I let her have discount off the clothes she wanted. ",Thinks she is royalty,699,talesFromRetail
EmilyamI,121,,77,1gjbz4,,587,"A guy came through my line a few days ago with a cart of junk food and kids toys and socks. He had a young daughter with him - probably five or six. I ring up all the items and it comes to something like fifty dollars. 

He slides his card and it's declined. I invite him to try it again, since sometimes it's a fluke. He slides again, declined again.

""Okay, Sir, it does look like the card was declined again. Did you have an alternate method of payment today?""

""No, just... just take off everything except for this."" He hands me a bundle of socks.

So I void out the transaction and ring up just the socks while he leaves his kid at my register and pushes the cart (complete with junk food and toys) over to a random corner for no reason that I could fathom. His total comes up to something like three bucks and his card goes through.

I bag his socks and pass them to him over the counter and say ""Have a nice day."" 

His daughter looks up at him and says ""Daddy, what about my toys? What about the chips and the cookies? Where is the soda?""

And the bastard points at me and says ""This lady says you can't have any.""

Kid looked up at me, burst into tears, and told me I was a mean lady and she really wanted that Minnie Mouse doll. She was crying so hard he had to carry her out.

1piperpiping,91,,115,1hzopc,,581,"So this is a story from when I worked in a supermarket as my first job as a teenager many moons ago.

I was working the Tuesday or Wednesday closing shift (store closed at 10 weekdays), it was about 9:30.  Guy comes running into the store, and runs down one of the aisles.  He's about 5'6"", skinny, looks 30ish but balding, and is actually wearing a pocket protector (only time I've seen this happen in person not as part of a costume).  Pretty much the stereotype of a nerdy engineer/programmer.

There's me and one other cashier working, registers next to each other so we can chat of course.  Guy comes sprinting up to the other cashiers line, so I go over to bag.

""NOIdon'tneedabagthankyou"" He yells hurriedly.  Ok, whatever, no bag.

I then look and see what this man had so desperately needed.  Three items.  Diet Root Beer, 12 pack of condoms, big tube of lube.  Cashier rings it up, gets the total, it's $17 and change.  Guy throws a 20 on the counter and runs out of the store, without his change.

""Have a good night"" My coworker yells (we had to, it's company policy).

Guy hesitates near the door and looks back, with a huge ass grin on his face. ""Oh, *I will!* He says with a smile and a wink as he heads out the door.

Supervisor on duty walks over (she's in her 40s, has a 16/17 year old son who works in the store), looks at the door.  ""Lucky guy.  He's getting **some** tonight!""

One of my favorite pleasant customer stories.  Supervisor held on to the extra change and used it to even out people's tills who were off so they wouldn't get written up.

I run a small manufacturing business and we are releasing a much anticipated product to a single retailer on Thursday.  Knowing that the retailer was planning a lot of promotion for the product launch, I emailed them.

Me:
&gt;Hi [retail manager], I would like to start promoting our product launch on our Facebook and Twitter pages, and wanted to check with you before I did so I don't conflict with anything you're planning.  Are you okay with me announcing it online?

The reply:
&gt;Yes, please promote it!

And so I do, updating my social media to say that the much anticipated product will be available at [store] starting Thursday afternoon!

Within minutes I had a call from the retail manager:

&gt;Can you please remove the new posts?  I didn't want them up until we were ready to sell.  I'm getting calls from people looking for the product, and they're angry that it isn't available yet.

Why?  Why did he not read that I was going to promote the product launch?  Why did the customers not read to the end of the two sentences to where it stated the launch was Thursday afternoon?  I love the retailer, and I'm thrilled people are so excited to buy, but why can't everyone just make it easier on themselves and read?

reallysuchalady,83,,154,1rby8t,,579,"there's a woman that comes into my store every once in awhile that will will proclaim to all the associates and customers about her life as a surgeon. (she is more like a mental patient that they just let out) she will spend hours and hours in the store shopping, and talking non-stop. 

today after she is done with her shopping, she comes up to my register. she has about 10 pairs of shoe laces, a pair of pants and asks me to get some of the stuff she put on hold. the stuff she put on hold the day prior was not properly put away and went back on the sales floor. she proceeds to have an absolute fit and starts speaking under her breath in another language. 

the next thing she does is whip out her cell phone, which i mind you did not ring (she always pretends to talk on her phone as on an official call) and she answers, ""This is Dr. So-and-So WHAT DO YOU WANT? NO. I TOLD YOU ALREADY. IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST, YOU'RE NOT GETTING SURGERY.""

at this point, i can barely even hold back my laughter. she spends the next 15 minutes upset and trying to figure out what pairs of shoe laces she wants and ends up buying them all.

TLDR: woman who pretends she is a surgeon picks up her non-ringing phone and says if you're not on the list, you're not getting surgery and hangs up.

Inceptagon,113,,112,1eb5ex,,576,"This is my first post, so just let me know if I'm doing anything wrong!

I work as a kitchen grunt at a fast food place. My favorite station is drive-thru because we are a bit of an upper-class place and our menu items border on ridiculously complicated, so I enjoy just sitting back to take orders and letting everyone else do the work of making the stuff. Still, there is the occasional customer who makes me want to tear my hair out.

Late one night, I get a guy who talks on the speaker in a low, passive-aggressive tone, as though he's being forced to order food against his will. He orders about seventy dollars worth of food, and says that he wants his food in ""separate bags,"" which is fine. We get that a lot. So I listen as he lists what goes in the first bag, then the second bag. Then he makes some modifications to the first bag. Then he asks to change something in the second bag. Then he asks to remove some items from the first bag and put them in the second bag. This starts to get on my nerves, but I seem to be following along just fine, and I go with it. Finally, when he's all done, he says ""So what's the total on the first order?""

Oh *snap*. It dawns on me that he wanted separate *orders*, not just bags. And I learn he didn't just want two, but three separate checks. And that's a bit terrifying, because our point-of-sale software is very badly designed and it's a nightmare to split arbitrary items onto a separate check. So I tell him to pull around to the window (there were no other cars in the lane at the time) and I'd tell him his total there. 

When he gets to the window, he looks seriously pissed, but I try to ignore it and I calmly tell him, ""I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't quite catch that you wanted your check split into different orders, I thought you just wanted separate bags. So I'm going to go through everything one more time just to make sure I have them on the correct checks.""

And I do. I meticulously list every single item he ordered, one at a time, and wait until he gives a ""mm-hmm"" or a ""yes"" or some sort of confirmation before continuing. It takes about fifteen minutes, no joke. But I walk him through each check, and I give him his total for a check and swipe his card before moving onto the next. This is my typical problem resolution strategy when I'm not entirely sure what the customer ordered.

But to my horror, as soon as I give him his third and final credit card receipt, he stares at it for a moment, and he gives me an odd look. I ask, ""Is something the matter?"" and he says ""Wait, this is all wrong. These are all on the wrong checks.""

It's at this point that I nearly explode, thinking, *I just spent fifteen freaking minutes double-checking every single item him... and he waits until AFTER I run all three of his cards through to realize everything's wrong?!! DID HE THINK I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF?!!*

When I went to get the manager to conduct the post-adjust, I explained (more like ranted about) the situation, and I asked her to finish the transaction for me because I couldn't hold my composure in front of the guy anymore.

Whenever I train someone on drive-thru, I warn them that the hardest part isn't learning our menu, or learning our glitchy and aptly-named POS software interface. That's only the beginning. The real challenge is dealing with customers who have communication issues.

Some background.  I worked at a local convenience store for the better part of 6 years.  My store in particular, being a small neighborhood store, closed at 1:00 AM.  This store also had a full service deli with a steam table that we would serve soup, hot sandwich items, and hot sides from.  At 11:00 PM we would disassemble the steam table for cleaning.  The below customer, which I will refer to as AC, came in at 12:45.


AC  :  Yea, can I get a meatball sandwich?

Me  :  I am sorry miss but we have already cleaned up the hot foods for the night.  Can I get you a cold sandwich or something? (As an aside, this already annoyed me because we had cleaned up everything and put it away) 

AC  :  Nah, how about some Mac and Cheese?

Me  :  As I said, no hot foods.  Sorry about that.

AC  :  Do you have any chicken noodle soup left?

I was working the drive thru yesterday and we were swamped with people and low on staff. I answer the drive thru and this man answers with ""lkjasdufoaskn"". I had no idea what he said so I said ""I'm sorry sir, could you repeat that?"" Again I get garbled response. I look to my coworkers who are also wearing headsets and hear his response. Everyone was very confused. I asked one more time as politely as possible. And he screams his order which makes it much more difficult to hear but I believe he orders two sandwiches and a coffee. 

When he gets up to the window, I charge him for his order and pass out the order. He immediately starts cussing at me. His face is a violent shade of red and is just screaming about how I can't do my damn job right and how he only ordered one sandwich. My manager is standing next to me and offers to take over. The man then throws the extra sandwich at my manager and demands a refund. Manager gives him his refund and then tells him he must leave and if he ever treats his staff like that again, he will be banned from this store. He screams a few more cusses at manager to which his response is ""And have a nice day."" and waves good bye.

The car immediately behind him apologizes for what I have to put up with and tips me $10. How do people get to the point where they think that behavior is okay?

ResultsVary,117,,144,1nahw7,,573,"Hello, friends from TFR. I come with more glad tidings and hilarity from &lt;Insert Office Supply Company Here&gt;.

So. A little background. My company (like most) does have a return policy up to 14 days. We'll return any item (provided it hasn't been opened) within the first 14 days. After that, tough titties. Also, if the product is open, I AM going to search said product to make sure everything is in there that is supposed to be. If a piece is missing? Tough Titties. If all parts are accounted for, I will return it with a restocking fee of 20%. Don't want the restocking fee? Nothing I can do about it.

Anyways. Now that little piece of policy is out of the way, we can move on. 

Fast forward to tonight. I'm the closing MOD (Manager on Duty) and I was in the cash office trying to fix one of our little palm pilot computers when I hear a knock at my door. It's our only cashier at the moment. He has a couple returning an office chair. Not a big thing.

But of course... there is always a complication. Not only is said chair an online order (which we're not supposed to return in the first place) but it has been partially assembled. We're talking literally half put together. Half put together wrong. 

I sigh, not wanting to tell someone ""oops. can't return it. my bad."" and get them all pissed off. I tell the cashier to tell them there will be a 20% restocking fee on the chair. 

I get another knock at the door, and it's the cashier telling me they want to speak to me. Here we go.

For the sake of it... I'm going to call the woman CW and the guy CM. 

Me: Hey folks! What seem's to be wrong with the chair?

CW: Nothing. It just didn't fit.

Me: Well. As &lt;Cashier&gt; stated, We can return it, but there'll be a 20% restocking fee.

CW and CM: EXPLAIN WHY. (literally in unison. they practiced.)

Me: Well. For one, per our return policy, I shouldn't even be returning online orders. You have to go through the company for that. For two, since I am returning it, and the chair isn't in it's original packaging, I have to charge a restocking fee.

CM: That's bullshit. No one ever told us that.

Me: Sir, our salesmen on the floor don't go over every piece of the return policy.

CW: Well. I don't see it placed anywhere. How are we supposed to know what your return policy is?!

Me: -taps the gigantic fucking mat with massive print ""RETURN POLICY"" in front of them.- This is placed at every register so that customers can see what the policy is on whatever item they are purchasing. 

CM: Come on! Like I'm supposed to remember all of that. it's not printed anywhere else for us to see!

Me: -Turns their receipt over.- It's also printed here. Several times.

CM: Well the salesmen should have told us! We wouldn't have bought the chair! The reason we're returning it is because it took us 2 hours to assemble and it was too big! You guys should build chairs for your customers for free!

At this point... I keep my mouth shut. I have personally built the chair in question in under 15 minutes. It's actually one of the easiest chairs we have to build.

Me: I apologize for the time it took, but I have to stand by my store's policy. I'm happy to return it with a 20% restocking fee. 

CM: YOU ARE VIOLATING MY RIGHTS AS AN AMERICAN!

Me: ... wut?

CM: YOU ARE BREAKING &lt;Midwest State&gt; LAW BY CHARGING ME FOR RETURNING.

Me: I'm pretty sure &lt;Midwest State&gt; doesn't have a law stating that... 

CW: Honey. Calm down.

CM: NO. I'M GOING TO THE BACK TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THE RETURN POLICY STATED BY THE CHAIRS. ALSO, I'M CALLING MY LAWYER.

Me: Uh... Okay?

CW: I'm Sorry. But still. We're not paying the restocking fee. Do you guys really expect us to put everything back in the box?

Me: We're actually not supposed to return it at all if it's an order. That's why there's no return code at the bottom of the receipt. I'm returning it as a kindness.

CW: Well. I've seen you guys sell chairs off your floor. Do you charge an extra 20%?! 

Me: ... No. If one of the chairs is discontinued and the display is our last one, we'll sell it 10% off. 

CW: EXACTLY. SO WHY CHARGE 20%?!

Me: Because, ma'am, this is a business. I will now have 2 displays of the same chair. And I'll eventually have to sell the one you returned at 10% off. 

CW: UNGH. I need to speak to your manager. 

Me: I am the manager, ma'am. 

CW: No. Your REAL manager. You're far too young and stupid to be running a place like this.

Me: Well. I'm the only manager here, the other one will be in tomorrow morning, and because you've insulted me now I'm going to definitely going to charge you the restocking fee. 

It keeps going. This entire thing took like 20 minutes. Stick with me, TFR, it's almost done.

CM comes back up, red in the face, and vein protruding from his neck and forehead. 

CM: OUR LAWYER IS AN IDIOT! AND NOWHERE BACK THERE IS YOUR RETURN POLICY OUTLINED.

Me: Sir, We can't post our return policy on every single item or place. That's why it's on the back of the receipt as well as at the register. As I told your wife just now, you can come back tomorrow morning and talk to another manager if you are not happy with what I'm telling you.

CM: WE WILL. AND I'LL FIND THE LAW YOU'RE BREAKING. YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

CW: We'll be back tomorrow. 

And with that. They grab their chair, receipt, and remains of their dignity and left. &lt;Cashier&gt; looked terrified. I shrugged and went back to doing what I was doing. I texted the manager who would be in the next morning and told him the story. He vowed to stand up to my decision. 

Honestly. If you're going to buy an item, why not know the return policy? I mean I deal with at least 10 returns a day where the person doesn't understand that if a product is opened we have to charge a restocking fee in order to deter people who will ""rent"" items.

**TL;DR: Apparently I'm violating the constitution and my states laws by charging a restocking fee for a half constructed chair out of it's package.**


**UPDATE:** Boss just text me back. Apparently the couple came back right at open. As in they waited outside the doors for 30 minutes until we opened. He told me that they gave him the same schpeel and how I was an idiot and breaking the law by charging them 20%. My boss said he actually laughed, told them that because they insulted me they lost all chance to bargain and that he wouldn't even return it with a restocking fee. Because, per store policy, he didn't have to.

So today's is one of my favorite tales of catching a liar in an act.  This is the tale of **Dig Dug**. Throughout the story, please insert your own shoveling noises with each lie, to accompany the image of this girl digging herself deeper.  Or if you are a RvB fan, just pretend she made shoveling noises with her mouth. Anyways....



So it's another day at GDNickels.  My partner Stacy is on the cameras, when she alerts me to a case.  On her screen is a young latina woman, pushing a baby stroller, and accompanied by a younger girl who looks maybe 10 or so.  Stacy had already seen then place some fashion jewelry on top of the hood of the baby basket, and then cover them with some shirts they selected. So while its concealment, its one of those situations where it doesn't mean they are going to steal the items.  We see people place items there all the time. Sometimes as convenience and sometimes as a way to steal.  Either way it warrants watching. We knew we had a real case on our hands when they folded the hood up, pretending to coo at the baby inside.  Now all the items were concealed inside the stroller.  The two girls walked around, before finding a corner of the store where they quickly reach into the folded hood of the stroller, and shoved the clothes into a baby bag. They then proceeded to head to the exit of the store.  

Stacy and I met them at the exit, did the regular LP steps, and led them to the LP office to process them. Now the older girl was already in trouble.  But, like most shoplifters, she tried to lie her way out of it.  What makes this story different is the amount of lies fed to us, and the sheer stupidity of them.  So we will call this girl Dig Dug, or DD for short.

So we are in the office, and I'm searching the baby bag and stroller while DD and the younger girl are sitting on the bench.  Stacy is questioning them. DD says she has no ID but that her name is yolanda and she is 16 years old.  The younger girl says she is 12.  Inside the baby bag I find baby items, our merchandise, and several pairs or shirts and jeans from other stores, all without a receipt.  Now in the bag is one of those plastic containers containing baby wipes.  I open it up and taped to the inside is DD's license.  And sure enough, her name is not ""Yolanda"".  So I turn to the younger girl and ask how she knows ""Miranda"".  The little girl replies that she is her aunt.  

Me: Ok. And what was her name again?

LG: Miranda

Me: But she said it was Yolanda

DD: Miranda's a nickname.

M: I see. Then who is [Insert Real Name from license here]?

DD: Never heard of her.

M: Well thats funny cuz there is a drivers license hidden in the baby wipes with your picture and that name.

DD:  I've never seen that in my life. You planted it there.

Me and Stacy shared a glance and started to laugh

M: So I planted a fully ready license with your picture and false info, never having met, or even seen you before 5 minutes ago when you were stealing our stuff?  I also supposed you are really 16 and not 19 like this license says?  ::Shoveling Noises::

DD: I bought those clothes.

M: I'm sure you bought all these other clothes in this bag from the other stores too?

DD: Yea we were returning them.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Listen, you're already in a lot of trouble for stealing with two children in your presence.  Lying isn't gonna help.  Is this your real name?

DD:  Yes. 

M: That wasn't so hard.  Now is this girl really your niece?

DD: Yes.

M: Well we don't have any way of verifying that until the cops show up.

DD, panicked, yells ""WHY ARE THE COPS COMING?"" while standing up. quickly. Stacy forces her to sit back down, and tells her to stay seated unless she wants to get cuffed. Stacy then explained that the cops are coming because she stole clothes.

DD: But they just fell in there!   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: We have you on camera.

DD: So then you can see they just fell in there.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: So you want us to believe, despite what our eyes, camera footage, and common sense tells us, that the clothes and jewelry somehow fell into your baby bag. Despite the fact that they are in different parts of the store. Despite the fact that the bag was closed, and despite the fact that the bag was underneath your stroller?

DD:.....

M: Listen, we aren't idiots.  And even if we were, those lies just are so bad that you aren't doing anything but making an ass of yourself.

DD: DON'T SWEAR IN FRONT OF MY BABY AND NIECE!

M: DON'T STEAL IN FRONT OF YOUR BABY AND NIECE!

At this point the baby started crying, so we allowed DD to take care of him, and feed him while we waited and did our processing.

While we were waiting, I decided to continue to ask her about the other clothes.

M: These other clothes from these other stores, did they fall in the bag too?

DD: No we bought them early.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Well why are they in your baby bag and not in a store bag? And wheres the receipt?

DD: We spilt soda.  [OK FUCK THE SHOVELS. WE ARE GONNA NEED A BACK HOE UP IN HERE. Catepillar bitches!]

M: Umm.....oooook.  Spilt soda. And....?

DD: Yea so we had to throw the bag and receipt out.

M: Because the soda ruined them?

DD: Yes.  I promise

M:  Then why are the shirts neither wet nor stained?

DD:  We got them out in time.

M:  Why are you lying?

DD: I swear. If I stole them I'd have removed the store tags off of them.

M: You didn't remove the tags off of our shirts...

DD: Well I didn't steal them.

M: Listen, here's the deal.  When the cops come they are gonna ask you the same thing. If you can't prove you bought these, they are going to bring you, in handcuffs to the stores, and ask if they saw your purchase these. If they didn't, you'll be charged there as well. But if you tell me now, we will just return them to the store and save you the extra charges.

DD: I stole them.

Now in truth most stores have a policy that once its out the door, they can't do anything. And smaller stores can't accuse you of stealing it if they cant remember you buying them. The sheer amount of customers they get plus different cashiers makes it impossible.  I just wanted to put her down a few pegs.

M: Ok do you have anyone who can come get your niece and son?

DD:Why it's only like $100 worth of stuff, they'll just release me.  I've been through this before.

M: I'm sure you have, and yes it's only $100. But you're also look at two felony counts.

DD: FOR WHAT?

M: Child Endangerment.

DD: Bullshit.

M: STOP SWEARING IN FRONT OF YOUR NIECE AND SON!

DD: [Glares at me]

M: Listen I'm not trying be an ass here. You're not just gonna walk away.  You used two children to steal.  That's Child Endangerment.  That's a felony.  Someone is gonna have to come get these kids.  

DD: Nah you're lying. I'll be fine

M: I'm not lying. Listen I know you've been a pain in the ass and we've been harsh back but we are tryna help you here.  Would you rather someone grab them here or at the police station while you're locked up?

DD: Stop playing.  I'll be fine.

Eventually me and Stacy gave up tryna convince her and we sat in silence until the cops arrived. They did what they needed to do, laughed at the tales of stupidity we had to share, and asked DD if there was anyone she could call. 

DD: Why?

Cop: To come get the kids?

DD: What? Why?

M: I already tried to explain.

DD: Explain what?

Cop: Well someone needs to come get the kids.

DD: WHY?

Cop: Because you're going to jail for the weekend?

DD: WHAT? WHY?

Cop: Seriously?

The cop explained the child endangerment charges and how it was Saturday so she'd have to wait till Monday to be arraigned. DD was not happy about it. She was also shocked that I, upstanding young man that I am, wasn't lying.

DD: They don't have anyone else. I'm the only one.

Cop: Well then how come the Little Girl has a different address then you.

DD:  Tax Reasons.  [WELP NOW FUCK THE BACK HOE! CAN WE GET THAT GIANT DRILL MACHINE THEY HAD IN ARMAGEDDON?  MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE]

Cop: Tax Reasons?

DD: Yea it helps with Taxes. But she doesn't live there.

Cop: So you're telling me you're also committing tax fraud?


DD: Ummm.....No.  She lives with her mom.

Eventually the Little Girl told us her moms name and number, and she was going to meet them at the station to pick her up and DD's son.  From what I heard after, DD was bought dinner while at the station from MCdonalds. She made her meal choice, then promptly had an ""allergic reaction"" the second she bit into her meal. You know, the one she chose. The officer on duty decided an ambulance wouldn't get there in time so took out an epipen and told her to hold still so he could stab it into her heart to save her.  She promptly announced that she was fine, and it was ""just gas"".

lumpiestprincess,31,,139,1l0bgd,,573,"This is a tale from quite a few years back I'd mostly forgotten about, but decided to share.

I work at a largish independent store that sells reading material. We don't have a huge staff and usually work in pairs most days. When I first started the person I usually worked with was my age and hired a few months before me and therefor had minor seniority over me, and I did show him the respect he deserved. At first.

Not too long after I started he decided to return to school while still working part time. We were both in our early 20s, so that's fairly normal. He was going for chemical engineering and I definitely thought that was awesome of him. A lot of hard work ahead, but awesome.

Soon after he's back at school his work slips, his attitude slips, he's not doing things he's asked to do. He confides in me that he's staying up until 4 or 5 in the morning every day to do homework and assignments, going to school and then work and repeat. Poor guy is sleeping only a couple hours a day and I feel so terrible for him that I am happy to handle all the customers plus additional work like stocking when we work together so he can get some rest, even if it's while at work. Not that he was sleeping, but just getting more down time. I was doing the work of 2 people for him, and again, felt so bad for him that I was happy to do it.

This went on for at least 5 months when finally he slips up. He asks if I don't mind if he leaves early by a few minutes while I close up alone. Again, happy to, but inquire why. ""Oh I have a raid starting in 20 minutes and I can't be late.""

""Okay"" I say, then ponder ""I thought you quit WoW when you went back to school""

Nope, turns out the staying up until 4 or 5 in the morning was  him doing homework after his raids. He's start a raid at 10 or 11 at night, raid until the wee hours of the morning, THEN do his homework. At that moment I was absolutely livid. I was working my tits off because he was too busy playing WoW to live slightly responsibly. Not long after he was fired for stealing and god damn, I was both happy to see him gone but even madder because I was doing all that work so he could play WoW AND steal? Fuck him.

beemill,117,,112,18zz4w,,572,"So, I work at a store that sells tea (obviously won't give the name away) and this story happened to a co-worker of mine one day.

At our store we make drinks in addition to selling tea. My co-worker (let's call her Tiffany) was the only one on the floor and was trying to help two people at once. She was making a latte for one woman and then a second customer comes up and asks for a $25 giftcard. So, Tiffany tells the giftcard woman to just wait by the register and she'll help her as soon as she's done making the other customer's drink. 

Giftcard lady starts to walk away and Tiffany tells the woman ordering the drink her total. ""That will be $5.25"". All while making eye contact with this drink order customer. Tiffany walks over to the register and the giftcard woman looks at her and hands her $5.25. At this point Tiffany is puzzled and says to the woman, ""Oh you want a $5.25 gift card now?"" And this woman loses her shit. ""YOU SAID IT WAS $5.25!"" Obviously Tiffany is laughing inside at the stupidity of this lady and she goes, ""Ma'am, I'd be happy to sell you a $25 gift card like you originally asked, but that will cost you the whole $25."" This woman wasn't having it. She started yelling some more, ""YOU TOLD ME OVER THERE IT WAS $5.25! THAT'S WHAT I'M PAYING!"" ""I'd be happy to give you a giftcard, but the amount you're giving me is only for the total of $5.25. When I said that I was speaking to the other woman who ordered the drink."" ""NO YOU WEREN'T!"" That's when this crazy woman's daughter walks in to the store and asks what's the matter. When informed she just looks at her mother and says, ""Are you stupid?"" Of course, after that the giftcard mom realized how much of an idiot she really was and paid the proper amount.

sneakerpimp87,60,,136,1fnlw0,,571,"So this happened yesterday:

""I'm here to pick some food up for my neighbour's cats. She called you to let you know?""

""Yes, I have it here for her.""

""She has cancer.""

""Oh no, will she be ok?""

""No, it's all over her body and the doctors say she only has a few days left to live.""

""Oh my God! Is someone taking care of her? I hope she's not in pain...(and other variations of 'holy shit I can't believe it she seemed ok last I saw her oh no oh no...)""

""The nurse comes by once a day. So, you'll definitely be losing a customer! Haha!""

I'll definitely be losing a customer? I'LL DEFINITELY BE LOSING A CUSTOMER? WHO SAYS THAT? Yes, because that was CLEARLY my first thought. It wasn't how I hoped that poor woman had someone taking care of her, it wasn't how I hoped she wasn't in pain, it wasn't how I hoped she wasn't scared...it was that I was going to be losing a customer.

And then he kicked up a fuss because she didn't give him enough money for the food because there was a coupon I was honouring past its expiration date (I knew she had been in the hospital and it was a store coupon so it wasn't a problem, plus she had always been nice to me), but he didn't bring it with him. So he goes on and on about how she's on pain medication and keeps forgetting things. So he drives back to get the coupon. And he's STILL missing 4.30$ because she didn't add it up right. He insists I add everything up on the calculator first, and is like...""Ok, and now you take off the 7$..."" like I don't know how to add and subtract. He keeps muttering about the coupon and her forgetfulness and finally I said ""What's your point?"" 

And it comes up to 4.30$ more than what she gave him. So he asks me to do it again. My employee goes 

""There aren't 25 000 ways of adding it up. You're still short 4.30$. Do you have the money yourself? She'll pay you back, I'm sure. You can call her from here if you want."" 

And he flips his shit and says how he's only doing this to help out an old neighbour, how he was being so nice by running some errands for her, how her pain medication makes her forget things all the time, and how he doesn't lend money to anybody. He then storms out. Honestly, if I hadn't been in shock I would have gotten out my wallet and paid the difference myself to make him feel like an asshole for stressing out a woman who is dying over FOUR FUCKING DOLLARS. He comes back half an hour later with the money and pays it, while my employee and I are just giving him stink eye the entire time.

amildpikachu,95,,182,1gwvhd,,570,"I apologize for the wall of text, it was a looooooong night of Hell.

I work at a local hibachi restaurant as a serve since January. Now, one of the chefs and the management are completely inexperienced in the food service industry, so it gets ridiculous. 

For example, last night: 

I have two tables of my own to take care of, and another one (Table A) is set shortly after my larger one. The larger of my tables wants to wait a few minutes for one of the guy's wife to show up. After 20 minutes, they order and I put their ticket in the back for the next chef. The timing of it all led to where Table A, which came in after my table, was ahead of mine in waiting for a chef. No big deal, right? It wasn't my fault. The people at my table were genuinely sad because they thought they dropped the ball. Nope. After I go back to enter in some drinks in the POS, my manager comes in and starts chewing me out for purposefully holding the order so I could score the better chef. This goes on for awhile, but I'm speechless and just leave my station flabbergasted. 

During the rush, the other waiter and I couldn't find time to bus the tables which have already left. The manager comes in, fed up with the mess, and busses it. After I finally get a break to rest, she chews me and the other waiter out for being so slow and irresponsible. ""I like the other waiter better! He actually cleans his tables! Now, you guys owe me money. Pay me for cleaning your tables, because it's not my job to do it!""  

Fast forward to 9PM, I'm waiting for any late tables, which does happen from time to time. In walks one lady, sad that she wasn't going to be sat with anyone else. I tell her that I and another waiter will gladly sit with her if it helps her feel comfortable. She agrees, and sits down. In run the manager, the boss' wife and the dining room server. The boss' wife guides who through the menu, while, at the same time, the server shows her all the drinks in drink menu, and while the manager is asking her for her beverage order. Hectic and unnecessary. 

I walk over, apologize for the chaos and, since I'm up on rotation, I take her order as she's ready to eat. My manager yells from the station that it's (The boss' wife) Ashley's table. I shrug it off and continue. I run into the back to give the chef the ticket. As soon as I do that, out comes my manager. ""Amildpikachu! That's not your table! It's Ashley's! You, go clock out!"" I walk out with the manager following me, she's still telling me it's not mine to have. I finally snap and go off. ""Listen, I'm up. It's my rotation, it's my table. Not her's. She doesn't get to fucking pick and choose which tables she gets! It's bullshit! She's fucked me over on one table today, and it isn't happening again! Got it?! Good!"" She finally walked off, waving her hands, her mouth agape at what I had just said. 

To shorten up the next hour, I scored free food thanks to that last customer, got to sit down and rest, and got a $50 tip from her on a $42 bill. When my manager and Ashley saw, they weren't too pleased that I ""robbed Ashley of her tip"". 

Fuck them. Fuck this place.

Hesprit,43,,124,1coica,,564,"In my five years at this store, the most part of the job I was most ambivalent about was doing carry-outs.  Someone buys more than they can carry and I have to help them lug it to their car.  Sometimes it was great, I get to chat to a friendly customer as we walk in the nice weather to her car, and often I got tips.  Sometimes it was horrible, and the actual worst was a woman I have named ""Gertie Goodlife"".  

This woman has real entitlement issues.  The last time she was in the store three months ago, she had six huge bags of stuff, and was offended that she had to carry one of them, I took five.  We walk in the pissing down rain, her under her umbrella, me getting soaked.  When I need to put down her bags on a bench for a moment to regrip because of wet hands, she bitches at me.  When we finally reach her SUV, she drops her bag at the back, pushes a button on her fob to open the hatch, and demands that I quickly put the bags in because she's in a hurry.  She climbs into the drivers seat, beside her 20 yr old son who's playing with his phone. In the 45 seconds it took me to settle the six bags in the back I heard ""Come on!"" three times.  No tip, no thank you. Fuck her.

Jump to liquidation.  The Chief Liquidator tells me I'm not to do carry outs any more, but allows, when I ask, that I can use my break time to accommodate some of our favourite customers (really, I like most of our customers).  And you know what? The bugger does time me when I do carry outs.

Now this morning.  First I see one of my most favourite customers, a little old lady, maybe 189 years old (I swear to god, she looks ancient) but who is spry, with it, pleasant and a joy to serve. Let's call her Nanny Nice.  She practically has tears in her eyes looking at the bankruptcy signs.  I go over and say hello, she actually gives me a hug (never happened before) and tells me how sorry she is and asks if I have a new job yet, actually concerned for me as a person.  We chat for a minute, then I tell her I have to do other things, but I'm sure our regular sales folks will be more than happy to help her find what she needs (Everybody loves Nanny Nice, and I knew she'd be taken care of).  Then I go back to disassembling empty fixtures.  That's when I see Gerty Goodlife is in the store, full cart and all.  Don't care.

After half an hour, a coworker asks if I'll do a carry out for Nanny Nice.  I go to the chief liquidator, tell him I'm taking a five minute break to do a carry out, and grab Nanny's bags.  I put them in her car and she hands me a fifty!  I tell her it's too much (usually it's two or five).  She laughs at me and tells me ""I just bought two thousand dollars worth of crap I don't really need so I can certainly give a nice boy like you $50"" (Nice boy, btw, I'm mid-late 40's) I smile, hug her again and go back to the store.

There's Gerty at the door with six bags looking pissy and tells me ""You need to carry these to my car.""  The biggest shit eating grin spreads across my face:

""I'm sorry, we aren't doing carry outs anymore under the liquidation.  I need to get back to work.""

""I just saw you do a carry out!"" she screeches.

""Actually, I just took some of my break time to do a favour for a nice lady I consider to be a friend.  You aren't nice, you aren't my friend.  If you have a problem, go talk to the Chief Liquidator, he's right there."" I say pointing.  Then I go back to work disassembling fixtures, listening to the screeching coming from the front of the store for the next half hour as the chief liquidator tells her to drive her car close to the front doors and load her own damn car.

CondescendingMartian,129,,160,19az29,,570,"**TL;DR** Sought a Crayola Crayon Maker and buried myself alive. 


So, given how the tale of the Shitscalator utterly disgusted people, I felt that I should share one my stories on the other side of the spectrum. 

Two Seasons ago, I had traded out my coupon-shilling masters to work at a dreaded company involving a giraffe, toys, and toy's occasional quantum status as people. You might say that we were them, even. However, despite the fearsome reputation the company has as a place to work for, I was quite enjoying it. My boss didn't mind if I fucked around in a Spider-man mask on occasion, and the HR guy let me do toy demos once a month. Any job where I get paid to play with remote controlled helicopters for four hours is a fantastic job in my book.

Also I was back-of-house now and didn't have to come within a mile of customer service, which really did wonders for my disposition. 

On this particular December morn, however, we had more back-of-house guys than we needed and, as the least experienced member of our illustrious minimum-wage association, I was booted out to suffer on the sales floor. Given that Yule loomed over the end of the week like Santa over a plate of confectioneries, we were packed. 

A fair matron rushed up to me, reeking of cigarettes and bad life decisions. ""Sir,"" spake she, ""I absolutely need a Crayola Crayon Maker or my daughter's Christmas will be ruined.""

Now as an aside, I absolutely hate being guilted about this shit. My family is not exactly descended from Croesus, understand, and whenever people make me out to be their kid's last hope to receive the  one gift that would make-up for being mentally traumatized by their parents I remember my mother taking out two jobs when I was a brat so my sister and I could have half the stuff we wanted. I don't want to feel responsible for people's holiday not playing out like a Disney movie. God dammit, don't put that on me. I think I'll give Mom a hug when I get home tonight.

So, she wanted a Crayola Crayon Maker. Needed one. The world would end without one. And so, by my obligations as a knight, and the fact that I was getting paid to do this sort of thing, I told her that I would quest into the fabled ""Back"" for her. 

I immediately rushed to the greatest of Sages, the store inventory count, to acquire the knowledge I needed to reach my prize. It bent down under the weight of its knowledge, and I was bathed in the illuminating electric glow. We had exactly two in the store, and both were on the sales floor. Flying fucking shit dammit. 

But how could I call myself a knight if I surrendered at the first sign of resistance? My noble ancestors would be ashamed of me! After freaking out about how they were alive in a world that they didn't understand, sure, but ashamed nonetheless!

(Though worst come to worst I could probably distract them with indoor plumbing for a good month.)

I asked the font of knowledge where my prizes were last stored. I received a few bays, where they had been scanned out weeks ago. Damn. I ran and did a cursory check nonetheless, but both the standard bays and the TZ single item bays were bereft of crayons, and the makes thereof. 

I returned to the matron with a heavy heart, and informed her of the trials that loomed before me. If she was willing to wait, I told her, I would search until I found them. If they were still in the store, they would be mine. This I swore on my honor. Then I remembered how I stole my sister's dessert the night before and swore on the holiday season itself. Mentally of course, since I don't actually talk like that out loud.

Surprise of all surprises, she said that she would wait. Usually when I say that I have no idea how long it would take me to find an item, if it even remains in the store, the customer departs in a huff. But she remained, determined to wait out my efforts, and my previous coldness regarding her cause melted away. I resolved to do my absolute best to find a Crayola Crayon Maker for her.

I journeyed to the faraway hills of the re-shop carts. My prize dwelt not among the people there. I climbed the fabled cliffs of overstock bays, but my quarry remained elusive. 

It was then that I knew where I must go. The mountains of shit that got unloaded from the truck last night. While technically in the back, they weren't scanned into any bays. My heart sank and for a moment I despaired. 

But no! I did not come this far to be defeated by a tower of cardboard boxes! (Seriously, it probably broke a few safety regulations.) I would climb to its peaks or perish in the attempt!

Reaching the loading dock, I beheld my enemy. Somewhere, deep within the heart of the mountain, lay a box of Crayola Crayon Makers, sweeter than any gem ever unearthed by mortal men. It had to be. It *had* to be!

I spent twenty minutes crawling around and on top of the pile. It was nowhere in sight. I excavated several tunnels into the depths, but I found it not. My heart began to wrestle with the possibility of failure. 

Suddenly, something caught my eye! In the very back of the pile, just barely visible thanks to my digging efforts, a box with the ""Crayola"" brand emblazoned upon it peeked out of the gloom. I strained to see if it was followed the the word ""crayon"", which would hopefully bring the word ""maker"" along with it, but I could not make anything else out.

Hope was kindled. 

I carefully crafted a tunnel through the heart of the mountain, probably breaking even more safety regulations. I gingerly crawled through an opening supported by some hot wheels and a box of Iron Man masks. On my hands and knees, I inched towards the box. My fingertip could just barely brush it. Then I managed to get an index finger around the corner. I strained, and strained, and managed to get half of my palm on the box. This gave me enough leverage to pull it towards me.

I felt like the event should have been accompanied by sunbursts and the choir invisible. As it was I read the words ""Crayola Crayon Maker"" celebrated only by a cloud of dust and spider poop. Still, though, never did I know a sweeter triumph. I hollered, a tribute to my conquest, and raised my fist in victory.

As I did so I accidentally punched the roof of my tunnel and collapsed it onto myself. I was trapped. Entombed, before my time.

Fortunately my compatriots had heard my yodel of triumph and came to investigate. A few minutes later I was free of my premature grave, though not without more than a bit of teasing, and striding towards the matron with my head held high.

She received her crayon maker, I received a commendation, and Christmas was saved for everyone forever.

IronyJudge,61,,135,1q54dq,,564,"Back before I was the store's know-it-all guy I was a lowly cashier. I took pretty quickly to dealing with our archaic system and found out many of the system's rather unfortunate quirks. The system will block you out if you're at a certain screen. If you hit the wrong button at a particular time it'll discard data and make angry noises. One of the more unfortunate problems is how there is a screen of no return. Once you reach it it is impossible to go back no matter how much you try.

I was still pretty new so I was in the panicked ""They're going to fire me for doing something wrong"" state. Any time a customer made a complaint I'd shit myself in fear, until one fateful night. I've previously stated my store occasionally serves people who inhabit the most notorious snob suburb in the metro area.

One rather nice old lady comes up with a few cans of one particular brand of dog food. I start scanning the cans, then the customer behind her in line starts screaming.

PR Lady (decision for the initials to be revealed later): THOSE ARE MINE.  
Me: Sorry, they were the same brand as her's. 

I then remove the two cans I scanned from the first customer's bill then close out the transaction. She pleasantly thanked me and went on her merry way. PR Lady was now at bat and she plopped a bag of dog food face down (UPC up) on the counter. I scan her 3 cans of dog food then the bag of food, ask her for her rewards card information, announce the price total. She swipes her credit card willingly, then I hit the button that brings you to the screen of no return. It's the screen to sign for the purchase.

PRL: ""Did it give me my dollar off?""  
Me: ""I'm not entirely sure, but we're past the point of no return. Once you sign and the receipt prints out I'll see and if it didn't I'd gladly fix it if it didn't.""  
PRL: ""I'm not signing for it.""  
Me: ""The transaction can easily be fixed. If you sign and there is a problem we'll simply cancel it out and do it again.""  
PRL: ""Just go back and tell me if the dollar came off.""  
Me: ""I can't do that. You can't go back from this screen.""  
PRL: ""YES YOU CAN. GO BACK AND TELL ME IF MY DOLLAR CAME OFF.""  

I'd been working there for a few months by that point, mostly on register, and she knew the system better than me apparently.

Me: ""Once the receipt prints out I'll be able to tell you. If you could just sign really quick, and if it's wrong we'll be able to fix it.""  
PRL: ""NO.""  

Here's where I make the fatal mistake. I reach over to the credit pad, and hit the cancel button. This has the effect of immediately time-outing the machine and popping out both the receipt, and a little paper slip for the customer to sign.

PRL: ""YOU JUST SIGNED FOR ME. WHAT THE HELL. YOU LITTLE BRAT. THIS IS FRAUD!.""  
Me: "".... manager to register one. Backup cashier.""  
PRL: ""I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR THIS. YOU ARE GETTING FIRED TONIGHT YOU PUNK."" 

Manager then arrives. In the few months I'd worked she's proven herself to be among the most level-headed in the store. She also has the poker face of a champion.

AGM: ""What seems to be the problem.""  
Me: ""She was unsure if the sale price ran...""  
PRL: ""There was a coupon on the front of the bag, he didn't ring it up. I refused to sign for the purchase, then he signed my name. This is fraud. This is legally fraud!""

I had no knowledge of this coupon. She put the bag face down on the register. There was no way I could have seen it.

Me: ""I hit the cancel button to make the mach...""  
PRL: ""YOU SIGNED FOR ME.""
AGM: ""I'm sorry about that. I will cancel out the transaction and I will personally ring it up and make sure the coupon gets in.""

The customer behind PRL pipes up and says to me ""You did nothing wrong. This lady is just crazy."" That made me happy, and PRL just kept on with any possible insult towards me she could. AGM finally finishes the transaction with the coupon applied, PRL signs, then walks out the door.

I go back to ringing the nice lady who called PRL crazy. The customer behind her also gave words of consolation. The other cashier (now a manager) told me that was one of the worst she's seen.

Then AGM comes up behind me, gets on the PA and calls another cashier up.

AGM: ""She wants you to apologize.""

I turn around and PRL is standing at the front of the store, still fuming. The other cashier gets there and I walk over to issue my formal apology. 

PRL: ""You high school punk. I want you to apologize for committing fraud!""

I will admit, I look about 6 years younger than I am. It's reasonable for her to think I'm in high school by appearances, but at that time I was cracking open LSAT study books. I also decided to whip out my big-boy vocabulary.

Me: [""I do most solemnly apologize for any transgressions. If you could kindly enumerate every one of them so I may appropriately respond to my failures.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7mIy97_rlo&amp;noredirect=1)  
PRL: *rants on for two minutes without realizing just how much my apology was dripping with sarcasm* 

I tune her out. I don't care. I'm going to let her yell, and when she stops yelling for a few seconds I'll give her a canned response.

PRL: *stops yelling*  
Me: ""I understand your concerns. My intent was not to defraud you, but to make the machine print out a receipt to see if your dollar had been properly removed. I fully apologize for the misunderstanding and wish to assure you it was in good faith.""  
PRL: ""YOU BETTER APOLOGIZE. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD ANYWHERE I'VE GONE. I'M THE HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AT A MAJOR BANK. I KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE LIKE.""

And what a good job at PR for your bank you've been doing. All of the banks headquartered in town are reviled nationwide. 

Me: ""I assure you these mistakes will not be repeated.""

PRL then starts shouting for another couple minutes at me, which I again tuned out. AGM finally steps in and tells her she'll take care of it. PRL smacks into the door, and gets pissed until I open it for her. 

Once I get back inside AGM motions me to go to the office. At this point I'm shaking freaking out that I'm about to be fired. We get into the office and she instructs me to sit down. She sits casually on one of the tables and starts laughing her head off.

AGM: ""What a goddamn bitch! I didn't stop her because I was stunned at just how wretched of a human being she was. Sorry, but oh my god I've never seen anything like that before.""  
Me: "".... so I'm not in trouble?""  
AGM: ""I'll pay for some therapy if you need me to.""

And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

It was a loop. 

It was a loop of anger and death as I died for what seems like the 100th time in Volgarr the Viking. My phone rang as I died one more time, by that stupid bee.

Welcoming the break to my endless hell, I did not expect a text from my boss as this was my day-off. Dreading an emergency ""get yo' ass here this minute"" text, I tapped on it. 

""Check your FB. I sent you a link.Someone's pretending to be [The mother's name from Birthday Girl]"". the text read.

I closed the game and went to my Facebook, thinking somebody is reaping in the real life Karma for something that they shouldn't deserve. I was right and much more. It pissed me off. 

Mrs. B has a daughter that games and just had a birthday, but she isn't the Birthday Girl. I never saw Mrs. B in the shop, ever and I was pissed of by what she is doing. She was claiming that she and her daughter are in the story and ""was happy someone wrote about her."" People who was happy about their ""deeds"" and her daughter has been given toys, games and even a new PS3.

I wrote on the comments that I was the OP of the story and I will link this thread to the comments.

GreenEyedDemon,107,,177,1qtb0s,,563,"I've been lurking here for a while, and decided to post a story from my minimum wage slave job. I'm a cashier at a gas station just off a highway that runs through my state, so I get assholes from all walks of life. From the man who's impatient because I'm not counting his $5.07 in pennies for cigarettes fast enough, to the woman who demands I pump her gas for her because it's a bit windy out. This story happened about a month ago.

It was myself and a new-ish guy alone for the 4-12 shift. This guy was new enough to require some supervision for certain things (money orders, prepaid cards, phone cards, etc.) but there long enough to be capable of being alone for five minutes while I do my chores. Well, I'm outside doing trash and there's a few people in line inside but not enough for me to have to run in. I'm happily picking up peoples refuse from the overfilled bins, when I hear a regular customer yell my name out the door and say ""Green, (new guy) needs you"". I drop my stuff and go in and there's about 3-4 people in line behind a guy wanting a pre-paid card specific to the gas brand we sell (rhymes with hell). These take a minute to do, so I ask him to wait and open my register and get all the other customers out the door. After, I motion him to my register and he asks for a $50 station card.

I grab one and I'm getting ready to activate it, but I tell him I need to see the cash before I activate the card (as is our store policy). He says ""I'm not paying cash, do it as credit"" and puts his credit card on the counter. Oh boy, I know where this is going.

Me: Sorry sir, but I can't use credit or debit cards for purchasing a prepaid card.

Him: Are you kidding me? I've done this hundreds of times at different stations.

Me: Sorry sir, our store policy is cash only for prepaid cards.

Him: This is bullshit! I've been waiting for fifteen fucking minutes (closer to five) and you won't sell it to me?! I'm going somewhere else, you lost my business!

Me: Sorry, have a nice day.

He leaves, and I'm telling my coworker (this was his first experience with a mean customer) to ignore the assholes, the regulars make it worth it. I look down and what else do I see but the douchebags credit card. I look out and see he's just now leaving his pump. Normally, I'd run out and give it to them, but oh no, it appears I need to hang this card back on the rack and by the time I've made sure it's nice and straight, he's left. It's a company card, so I know he'll be back.

Hours later, near the end of my shift he walks back in, looking much more sheepish than earlier.

Him: Hi, uh, I was in here earlier and tried to use my card to pay for a gift card, did I leave it here?

Me: Yes sir, you did. Here you go! (I hand it to him with a nice smile).

Him: Sorry about going off the handle about that, I know it's not in your power to change the policy. I'll be going, thank you for holding it.

Me: No problem, have a great day!

I work at a small town discount store. It's a really nice place compared to our other locations, with a substantial clothing section, and a very large variety of groceries. 

One of the things we have to watch out for is return fraud. Generally we prefer that you have a receipt when returning something, but you can return a limited number of things per year without a receipt. People will sometimes lift things from the shelf and then return it for in store credit.

So this lady comes to my checkout with a her arms **full** of clothing, like at least 20 articles. 

Lady: ""Excuse me, I'd like to return these.""

I am not looking forward to this. This will take forever and we're busy, all the checkout are running.

Me: ""Is anything defective and do you have a receipt?""

Lady: ""No, I lost the receipt and none of it fits.""

Me: ""We do have several fitting rooms in the rear of the store, did you not try them on before purchasing?"" 

Lady: ""No, of course not, (insert paranoia logic here)""

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, I cannot do returns on all the items, as we have a limit of 5 no receipt returns per year.""

She gets visibly angry and starts making a scene.

Lady: ""Well, what do you want me to do here? I can't keep all this clothing if it doesn't fit!""

Me: ""I can call a manager if you like, she might be able to help you..""

Lady: ""NO! Do your job properly and return my things RIGHT NOW!""

Me: ""Ma'am, I need you to calm down or I'll have to call the owner to the front.""

Lady: ""NEVERMIND THEN!""

She throws the clothes down on the counter, storms out of the store. All the cashiers are looking at me, since this lady was super loud.

Next week, every store got an email with her picture in a security photo since she managed to pull it off in several other locations.

epiphanize,138,,137,1jfaeh,,559,"I finally have another story.

I work in a large store that sells groceries and accepts EBT (food stamps). On weekday nights it is usually fairly busy, but I am a fast checker, so it's usually not a problem. Last night I was working an express lane (20 or less), and a woman comes up with about 40 items. I'm not too picky, so I let her come up. 

Immediately, I knew that was a mistake. The first words out of her mouth were ""this is EBT, and I only have a hundred dollars. I know this is probably over, but you can take things off, right?""

Me: Of course, or I can keep a running total for you and you can say when to stop.

Customer: Let's just ring it all up and see how much it is first...

Me: Okayyyy..... (Insert beeps) your total is about $115.00.

Customer: I knew I couldn't get it all...

Me: What do you want me to take off?

Customer: All of it. I still have to go to Aldi and get stuff.

So I called a manager, and they abort the transaction.
Just as I'm asking her if she would like us to take care of her cart, she puts about half the items back up.

Me: Do you want to go ahead and get these?

Customer: I don't know... Lets see how much it is.

This time it was about $30.00.

Once again she says its too much and asks to cancel it. Different manager aborts.

We repeat this process about five times. When we finally get back to the original manager, she tells the customer she has to decide or leave the store. This encounter has lasted about an hour as she tries to decide what to get each time, and its killing my productivity report. 

Customer: But I'm poor! Can't we just do this one more time? I need this stuff!

Manager: Yes, we can cancel it one more time. And then you can leave. I can't have you wasting my cashier's time and the time of the people in line behind you.

The woman left the store in tears, and I honestly felt bad for her. But seriously, if money is that much of a problem for you, you should probably PLAN what your going to buy.","Can we cancel it, just one more time?",696,talesFromRetail
MajikToastsLady,82,,144,1j92st,,564,"Recently, I have moved an hour away from home for uni. I don't really know anybody here besides my boyfriend and our roommates. I've gotten to know a couple coworkers, and I'm still familiarizing myself with a the new store. I work for a fast food chain, and I transferred stores, so things are a little different. 


Today we had some very rude people come in to my store. I guess they do this a lot, however. Anyways, while sweeping up our lobby these two boys and a girl came in. They ordered food from me, no big deal. I got their food quickly, and there were no issues. They walk away with their food all was well.


A little back story: My coworker tells me how the girl and her sister had tried to get her fired once for something completely unrelated to work. Other than somebody brought up where my coworker works in a Facebook argument, and we have a social media policy stating we can't post anything about our company. (Reason why I am not naming where I work.) And so this girl and her sister tried to use this against my coworker and it obviously didn't work.


So, a little time passes and my manager asks me to go check our lobby, and clean up whatever needs done since we're slow.... No problem. Until, I am wiping down a table that is one table away from theirs. They proceed to have a conversation rather loudly that goes a little something like this...

Boy one: *Man I'm glad I don't have to work here.*

Boy two: *Me too, then I might get fat like that girl over there.*

Boy one:  * *looks over* * *Oh my God you're right.*

Girl: * *laughs* * *Guys that's not nice.* [sarcastically, of course.]


Are you fucking kidding me? Why on earth would you say that to somebody? They weren't prizes either... For clarification, I am a size 8. Not small, but not big. Just average. Everything about me is average. Except I'm a little short.


So I walk away to go get a broom to just sweep, hoping that they either leave or something changes. Well, no, when I had to sweep the area where they are sitting, they make sure to have another loud conversation about me.


Boy one: *Oh, and she's back again.*

Boy two: *Just watch her bend over, her rolls get twice as bad.*

Girl: *I'm glad I don't have that muffin top. That's just ridiculous. Obviously she needs clothes that fit.*

Boy two: *I'm glad you're not fat.* **[This is to his ridiculously thin girlfriend.]**


So I promptly left to just clean the other side of the lobby, and had told my coworker who had expressed her issues with them being there in the first place what just happened. She told her manager, and in doing so the front line team heard. While I was getting a mop to finish the other side of our lobby, my boyfriend (we work together) asks me what's wrong. I shrugged it off, told him it was nothing and finished that part of the lobby as soon as possible. 


I empty the mop bucket and come back to the front line to take my position back over, I see my manager throw this group out. This is the first time I have ever worked with this manager. But he gave me a thumbs up from across the lobby as they left. About ten minutes later he fields a call from two different angry moms on why their children, who were threatened first, were thrown out of our establishment. He proceeded to tell them that when they (the group of teenagers) initially ordered their food nobody said anything to them besides the obvious questions for their order. And that when his employee (me) went to clean the lobby, she didn't say a word to them. He had been in the office at that time counting the safe down, and could see me on the camera system. One mom left it at that, however the other mother didn't. She tried to question his authority, and he eventually just told her that it wasn't his job to parent her children. That they should have more respect for his employees, because every time they come into our establishment, something happens, and he always gets a call from her. He said he would be glad to sit down with the owner, the group of kids, and parents and explain why he is requesting that they be banned from the property.


Now mind you, I have just started working here. I just moved, and this is my third week. I know nothing about the group that came in. And this is the very first time I have ever worked with the awesome manager who threw them out.

hungry-eyes,63,,118,1ht7c1,,559,"I work for a large pharmacy chain. This story occurs on a Sunday, when you can imagine we are pretty strapped for staff anyway and its not the regular weekday team working. Somehow we always seem to get the really difficult customers on Sundays however.

So on this particular Sunday the phone goes in the pharmacy five minutes after we've opened. The Pharmacist answers and its a customer asking where her medication is. For older customers we offer a delivery service whereby their medication is delivered to their house each month so they don't have to come into town to pick it up. This particular customer had not received her medication and we were scouring the pharmacy and the computer system to find out why.

Whilst everyone is looking, the customer loudly complains to the pharmacist over the phone about the poor service of the company and then blurts out that she's ""called the police before and I'm not afraid to do it again"".

Yes, that's right, she threatened to call the police because she hadn't received her medication yet. The pharmacist's response was something along the lines of ""mam, the police can't help you unless its an emergency"". Her reply was ""it is an emergency: I'm dying"" (clearly a gross exaggeration).

As she continued with her abuse we eventually found our delivery list and realised that we had attempted to deliver her medication the day before but she wasn't in when the driver took it to her door. So turns out it was actually really her fault anyway.

She still needed her medication (and was apparently unable to wait for it to be redelivered the next day) so we had to call a taxi and asked the driver to deliver the prescription to her house. The driver was not comfortable carrying a prescription without a member of staff so we ended up sending one of the pharmacy team in the taxi with him and we delivered it to her door. Of course, the store had to shell out for the cost of the taxi, and from what I heard, she wasn't even appreciative when we finally got the medicine to her.

I can understand she is old and needs her medication, but to threaten to call the police and then not even apologise when it turns out it was her fault is pretty darn rude, don't you think?","""I've called the police before...""",677,talesFromRetail
Cyg789,47,,100,1dm5c1,,560,"Hi everyone, 

first post, so please let me live...

This story takes place roughly 10 years ago when I was in university and worked part-time for a fast food chain. While it wasn't uncommoon for customers to be rude, insulting behaviour towards and name calling of employees wasn't tolerated. Legislation in that European country regarding so called ""offences against personal honor"" like libel and slander is strict, and calling someone an asshole might result in prosection and having to pay the person you have insulted damages. Also, this whole ""get me you manager"" attitude isn't really common there either. You deal with me and me alone, and I'll throw you out if you don't behave. Managers have better things to do with their time.

It was a Friday evening shift in town, around 9pm. Work was slow as partygoers weren't expected until 10 or later. I was the only one at the till, my manager was standing behind me, handing me whatever our customers ordered. In came those two Turkish guys, talking in Turkish about what they'd done this evening. I greeted them politely and took their orders, they wanted to eat in store. That's when one of them started telling the other one in Turkish how that blonde girl behind the till would certainly be a good f*ck, how he knew for sure I would be easy to pick up since slutty till girls like me should be grateful for his attention etc. etc. Little did Mr. Dumbass know that the one they were mocking could understand every single word they said. I turned around, looked at my manager - who was aware I knew Turkish - grinned, and whispered ""Watch this"". I put their order on a tray, let them pay, looked at the one who'd unsulted me, and with the biggest smile on my face I told him in Turkish: ""You know, I'm not so sure if my (non-existent) Turkish husband, or his family for that matter, will be happy about the way you just insulted his wife."" 

Mr. Douche got white as a sheet and started stammering. It was awesome. He and his friend basically grabbed their food and ran out of the store, never to be seen again. My manager couldn't stop laughing that evening, I got an extra break and ice cream on top.

Around 8:30am a woman comes through my line, and as I'm ringing her up someone who obviously knows her sees her and they talk a little. 

As he walks away he shouts down an aisle asking her to buy him a pack of cigarettes. She kinda brushes it off at first, it sounded like he was joking. This guy just kept pushing! Finally she said ""if you can't pay child support I can't buy you cigarettes!"" Oh god, this guy is the baby daddy. He makes some back handed comment about her new boyfriend, trying to stir shit up.  

He asks her how she's buying all this food but she can't buy him cigarettes, and she explained how she had food stamps, he starts to throw a fit, something like ""how could you do this to the father of your child all it is is a pack of cigarettes, c'mon please"" etc. He finally stops and goes to the cashier on the other side of the kiosk. At this point I'm about done ringing her up, and she gets $50 cash back out after paying for the non food items and *makes me hide it* because he came over to harass her some more. 

He finally left, she was obviously embarrassed and apologized. I told her no one had to be embarrassed but him. A grown man throwing a fit over a pack of cigarettes (they were both early 30's). Despite her situation she was a really nice person and didn't deserve that shit. I wish I wasn't clocked in for that exchange. I talked to the cashier that rang him up.

leveraction1970,39,,131,1e1lmk,,560,"Way back when, in the late 80s, early 90s, I worked night crew for a national grocery store chain. The first thing the store manager told me when he promoted me to full time, and overnights, was that the night crew was filled with mutants perverts and mental defectives. I soon found out that he was right, but he neglected to tell me how entertaining the could be. 

We used to start work at 11 P.M. the first thing we would do was break down all of the pallets and 'spot' the load in the correct aisles. We did this by making stacks of cases and then wheeling them to the correct spot, in the correct aisle, with two wheeled dollies. 

We had two guys, one named Booger and the other Snapper. Booger was named that because he looked like a gross little troll, and Snapper was a pervert that was rumored to 'snap' his carrot in the men's room if he ever saw a hot looking customer. They spent a lot of time busting on each other and playing practical jokes on each other. 

While spotting the load one day, Snapper noticed that Booger was only twenty feet or so behind him and heading in the same direction. Snapper lifted weights and was on some high protein diet that gave him farts that smelled like something had died in his colon a few years ago and was trying to escape. So Snapper lets one fly and Booger walks right through it. He gets pissed and yells a bit. About a half hour later, Booger feels a good air biscuit building so he goes and finds Snapper. He sees him go into an aisle 5 or 6 down from where he was. He jogged up and caught sight of Snapper out of the corner of his eye. He spotted Snapper at the close end of the aisle almost hidden by the large end cap display that was overflowing into the aisle. Booger moved sideways and threw a hip into Snapper to hold him there while he rips out a fart that sounded like he needed to wipe afterwards. Booger laughed and ran away before Snapper could beat the crap out of him. The only problem was that when he made it to the end of the aisle he almost ran head on into Snapper coming the other way. He took a quick look back down the aisle and spotted the shocked middle-aged lady, with the same color shirt on as Snapper, standing at the end of the aisle wondering what the hell had just happened. 

Booger went and hid, and Snapper and I had to apologize to her for what had happened as the rest of the crew searched for the 'random drunk customer' that had farted on her. We had to spend about a half hour calming her down while Booger hid in the back of the deli department. It was disgusting, but hilarious, and thankfully never got back to the store manager.

Betelgeuse2040,69,,117,1qekfj,,556,"So I used to work at a Retail store that for the purposes of this story we shall call ""Paper Clips"".  This story will take some minor setup just to describe how the store is set up.  We have one main desk that is at the front of the store and works like a customer service/checkout/Tech Support combo pack.  To the right of the Front Desk is a ""one-way"" enter door that only opens to people entering the store.  To the left side of the desk is the actual door that allows you to exit the store.  Right in front of the service desk is our selection of tablets which as you can imagine is quite popular with they young kids and sort of allows the adults to shop in peace as their kids play games.

On this particular day a Mom comes in with her 3 kids(we'll say the oldest was about 8 and the youngest 6) and starts shopping.  The oldest of course immediately goes to the tablets and starts playing games, oblivious to the rest of the world.  The mother starts to finish her shopping and warns the kids to stop playing games and get ready to leave.  The 8 year old boy of course ignores her completely absorbed in a game of Angry Birds (or whatever he was playing).  As I am checking this lady out her two youngest get ready to leave with their mom and abandon their games like good kids.  She gives the oldest two more warnings by the time I finish up her order, but he keeps playing and shrugs her off.

This is where her Epic Parenting kicks in.  She looks at me, says thank you for ringing me up takes one last direct look at her oldest kid still playing the game frowns and and then leaves the store.  I look at the oldest kid for a minute and watch her load up her bags and kids into the car.  At this point I get worried cause I really don't want her to leave the kid behind (too much paperwork).  So I turn to the kid and say ""Hey kid!  Your mom is leaving you behind.""

Now then at the same time he turns around looks for his Mom, she is actually slowly driving away in her car (essentially looking like she is leaving him behind, but not really).  Kid goes into FULL PANIC mode and runs the wrong way to our door that only opens for incoming customers and realizing it isn't opening starts trying to pry it open with his bare hands like he is about to be killed by zombies or something.  Kid also starts yelling for his mom and is almost in tears (I am too but it's because I am laughing so hard).  Now our doors aren't really heavy but for a 8 year old it would probably be like trying to pry open a steel trap.  The mom meanwhile is slowly driving away along the front of our store.  I'm in tears laughing so hard and was about to help the kid, but my Manager got there first and managed to flip the reset switch at the top of the door which made it open for the kid.  The mother sees this happen and stops the car to let her kid catch up and jump in.  I catch her gigantic smile as she drives off probably knowing he will never do something like that again.  My manager looks at me confused as hell wondering what was going on and I tell him ""she was going old school parenting on him"" which gets a nod and smile from him as he goes back to the office.

Tldr: Kid plays games and doesn't listen to mother and gets fake ""left behind"" to teach him a lesson.  laughs were had.

I'm alone in the store beyond a customer coming in every so often.

This was not something I requested or agreed to when I came into my initial shift. I expected to be relieved after my eighth hour at work. Nobody came. Calls went out, and no response.

That it was not my responsibility to cover another shift! They tell me they're going back to bed and hang up.

I work the night shift. I expect my manager in the morning. I forget that it's a Sunday. 7 AM comes and goes. I look at the schedule and I was scheduled to come in this morning at 7 AM. My manager's cellphone is off. I ask my co-workers to do me a favor and come in, but I'm only promised that someone will be in at 3 PM to relieve me.

QWOP_Sparkle,85,,105,1liz1h,,550,"Hello TRF, I have a tale of a self entitled woman who believes she can speak to us all like we're slaves because, as I quote, 'I'm paying your wages!.'

Now at the cinema I work at we very rarely ever ban anybody. In the past 5 years I've worked there, we have only ever banned a small group of 3 teenage boys and that is because the final time they were kicked out they threatened to beat up our manager and knife him. All because we wouldn't let them take a phone call in the screen. Yup.

Now let me tell you about this lady who in the past 3 months has caused nothing but hassle, and we've had enough. Most cinema chains across the UK have certain filming 'events' on each week, kids films for cheap prices, silver screenings for pensioners for a discounted price etc. This lady, who I will call the AngryOreo for this story (relevant), is a regular to our pensioner film club.

Now she isn't old, shes in her early 20s but pensioners club is open to any age with the discount price still in place, so its a bargain for anyone who has the time to come along and watch a particular film. In the past 3 months she's caused a HUGE argument over the most ridiculous stuff.

These first few moments I wasn't there for, so I will explain from what I have been told from coworkers.

**2 Years Ago**
AngryOreo decides she wants a job at the cinema. Refuses to be interviewed by a manager and only wants to be interviewed by her friend who already works there. Red flags going off.
Friend is allowed to interview (as he had previous Supervisor position) so long as assistant manager is there.
AngryOreo answers all questions correctly to her friend, except non of the questions were the right ones to be asked. She didn't get the job.

So, from then on, she waited a while before coming back. She came back with a vengeance. 

**Instance Number 1**
As a new regular for the Pensioner Films, she thinks that her family can then abide against the law.

She brings her husband and two young teenage boys around the age of 12 to watch a film.

&gt; AO - A family ticket for Kick-Ass 2 (**15**)

&gt; CoWorker - I'm sorry but I can't process family tickets as this is a 15 rated film. Do your sons have ID with them to purchase teen tickets?

&gt; AO - Well...no why should they? I'm a regular to the film club, the manager knows me, I should be allowed in without having my children ID'd!

*wut*

&gt; CW - I'm sorry miss but I need to see ID because it's the law. Regardless of wether you're a regular or not, we need to see ID before we can allow entry. There are plenty of other films available that you can watch as a family.

&gt; AO - I'm his mum, I can vouch for them, they can watch the film with me I say its ok!

&gt; CW - But we can't miss. We must see ID, as it is labeled everywhere and it is the law.

&gt; AO - So every time I come and see an age rated film they have to bring ID?! What a load of shit! *Storms out*.


**Instance 2**
For the Pensioners Film, biscuits and other snacks are available for free, with a limit of course. For a while, we tried out Oreos, but they weren't very popular. They were going out of date and the only couple that got them were AngryOreo and her husband. So we stopped providing them as it was costing money which could be spent on other snacks the rest of the regulars would enjoy.

AngryOreo wasn't pleased.

&gt; *week1*
AO- Oh? No Oreos' this week? I'll just wait until next week.

&gt; *week2*
AO - No Oreos again?! Can we have them next week please?!

&gt; *week3*
AO - Why have you stopped doing Oreo's?

&gt; CW - Well they weren't very popular with everyone else. You're welcome to bring your own Oreo's in if that is what you personally prefer.

&gt; AO - Whats the point of free snacks if you aren't giving out OUR favourite snacks for free?! I don't want a biscuits. I'm not hungry now. *storms into screen giving CW the dirtiest look ever.*

You're getting a discounted price for a film and FREE SNACKS. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ARGUE AGAINST THAT?!


**Instance3**

This actually happened to me personally. I covered for the Pensioners Film, I haven't done this for a while as I usually have those particular shifts off so I was a bit rusty on certain things and times.

So of course, Angry Oreo comes in after the adverts and trailers have finished. I inform her, from the time displayed on my monitor, that the film had been on for literally *1 minute* but she wouldn't have missed anything crucial. Well thats not good enough, now is it?!

&gt; AO - What do you mean?! It says on your website it starts in 15 minutes! (shows me the times on her phone) See! So you fucked up! What do you mean I'm a minute late whats the point of me bothering now?!

&gt; Me - I'm very sorry, the website is run off a third party holder, we aren't in charge of the times that are written on there, we merely pass our time information on and ocassionally mistakes do happen due to human error. We're very sorry for the mistake this has caused, but as I said, the film has only been on for 1 minute.

&gt; AO - What a load of fucking shit! This isn't good enough! It's ridiculous! I can't believe this! There's no point, is there really?! I mean what the hell, who the hell goes and watches a film after ITS ALREADY STARTED?!


She's raised her voice now and staring at me like its *my* fault she's missed the start of her film. I'm on my own as my other coworker is serving the snacks and the manager has gone to collect stock from the delivery driver. I can't call for back up and this woman is getting in my face about this situation. 

&gt; Me - Miss I'm sorry, I understand you're upset and I'm sorry that the times were listed wrong on the site. Sometimes the times do change bu-

&gt; AO - Well no it's not 'sorry' really, is it? I have to come here half an hour fucking early every week now, don't I? Because I can't trust this fucking website. It's not acceptable, is it? Is it?!

At this point her husband comes in with bought snacks (guessing they decided to buy their own Oreos now) and she tells them theres no point because they're 1 minute late for the film so lets go home. Saying it as loud as possible, looking at me in the eye like she wants to murder me.

20 minutes later, I relay this to the manager. He says he'll speak to her about her attitude next week, as my coworker also heard shouting from the tills but couldn't leave their station to see what the issue was.


**Instance4**
As some of you may or may not know it was bank holiday last week, this usually messes up the delivery of our printed time sheet that usually goes out on an evening for the rest of the week. So of course our time sheet was delayed by a day. AngryOreo came in this week to see the new One Direction Documentary *gag* but of course, the time she saw on the sheet were the old times and not the new ones. So she goes ballistic at my coworker.


&gt; AO - You know what?! I can't trust the website, I can't trust the time display outside, I can't trust this cinema. This is a fucking disgrace, you know I pay your wages right?

&gt; CW - Sorry miss but the times are never usually late, its just with it being bank holiday, the film starts half an hour later than what was previously listed so you won't have missed anything.

&gt; AO - Doesn't change the fact I pay your wages. You're all disgraces.

&gt; CW 2 - If the issue is bothering you this much miss I can call out the manager and he can explain it to you in person.

&gt; AO - No thanks, I'm very good friends with the general manager so I'll speak to her at the next Pensioner Screening about how disgraceful you all are.

And with that, she took her tickets and walked to the screen.

Little does she know that when she comes in this week for the Pensioner Screening, she will be banned for coming back for being disrespectful to staff members, swearing in front of guests and being a general cunt.

The best thing is? *I'll be there when it happens.*

I'll keep you all posted ;)

kajsdhf,75,,110,19z76j,,553,"So my favourite form of revenge on a really arrogant customer HAS to be when they make a fool of themselves, and we get to spell it out for them like they're 5, make them look like idiots in the politest most sycophantic way possible. Thankfully, this happens a lot where I work. Normally it's something along the lines of this:

'I want a cheeseburger, but with no cheese.'

'Sir/Ma'am, I can do that as a hamburger if you'd-'

'Did I say hamburger? Would you listen to a customer for once? I pay your wages' (etc, making the biggest deal of this possible. )

'Sir/Ma'am, the cheeseburger costs 10p extra for the cheese, and is otherwise identical to the hamburger. To make sure you get your order exactly they way you'd like it, can I just check: are you asking me to charge you 10p extra for something that you would like specifically removed from your food?'

The hidden sniggers from the other customers normally make this worth it, especially if the customer gets embarrassed enough to stick to their guns and pay that extra 10p, but yesterday we had someone embarrass themselves just that little bit more.

So there's a lot of people who like their fries really hot. Not a problem. What can become a problem, is when we're selling fries so fast that the only ones ready have literally JUST come out of the fryer, and the customer wants us to put down a basket just for them. If they were polite and willing to wait it wouldn't be so bad, but this guy yesterday just lost it, and made himself look really stupid. 

(Customer is to be read in a nice, south london accent, with just a hint of fake *thug lyfe*. Also, he looks about 12.)

The guy next to me who was serving this customer was french, and I was eavesdropping (not native but I speak it too). This customer (we'll call him RudeBoi) starts laying into him about how he 'NEEDS hot fries', and the ones he was given 'JUST WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH', and 'WHY does he have to wait? *Because everyone else was getting THEIR fries, why are HIS taking so long?*' My co-worker gets irritated and starts grumbling away to himself in french; stuff like 'Ahh this is so stupid, why doesn't he just take the fries'. RudeBoi hears him talking in french but completely mishears it / makes it all up, and starts shouting.

'Oi! I heard what you just said! You said Pu-tan!' (really shoddy attempt at putain - french expletive similar to fuck - but with a really strong english accent.) 'I know what that means, *YEAH I speak French* and I won't be talked to like that!' 

It should be noted, the co-worker didn't even use the word, or swear at all. But seeing as RudeBoi said he spoke the language, he just started explaining the situation in french for him, even prefacing it with 'well seeing as you speak it, maybe I can help and explain it better for you in french.' 

The blank look on his face when he didn't understand a thing was brilliant, and as if getting caught in the middle of a massive lie wasn't good enough, he burnt himself on his fries afterwards. The customers in the line he was holding up were laughing at him, and sweet victory was had.

SpoonPoetic,90,,99,1ev41y,,558,"This woman is literally calling my store several times a day asking to speak with the owner (who's never around, thankfully) to try and get me fired.

The story:

She drives directly up to the drive thru window, skipping the speaker, so we don't even know she's there for a minute. When my barista notices her there, she apologizes for not seeing her, and without even acknowledging her, this woman jumps right into talking down to her: ""Does a mint mocha have mint in it? Yeah? How about mocha, maybe?"" Like she's 5 and stupid. My barista says ""oh that was supposed to be a mint mocha? I'm so sorry, hold on one second.""

We whip one up for her and I head to the window with it. ""I'm really sorry for the mix up! Here's a brand new mint--"" She interrupts, absolutely screaming. ""I DON'T WANT THAT, I WANT A REFUND!""

She keeps screaming at me for several minutes, basically repeating herself (""this isn't a mint mocha, it's supposed to be a mint mocha, I want a refund, this isn't a mint mocha..."") as I'm trying to gather the pertinent information to get her refund for her. If she had listened to me for one second, she would have also received the mint mocha, for free. I can't get her to slow down or listen to me for one second so I can't even find her order to give her the refund (I kind of need more information than ""I wanted a mint mocha but didn't get it"" - what did she pay with? what time of day did she come?). Plus there's a line of customers building up behind her.

So I asked her, ""I'm really sorry about this mix up, I am doing my best to fix it for you - would you please refrain from yelling at me and I can get this sorted as soon as I have all the information I need to void the order?"" She screams even more loudly, ""I'M NOT YELLING!"" before yelling at me that she paid with a Discover card an hour ago.

(Bonus: This information lets me know that this woman in fact ordered a plain latte, I even double checked to make sure she didn't want any flavor in it - she was the first Discover card I'd seen in weeks so I happened to remember that transaction clearly. But for the sake of customer service I keep pretending it was our mistake instead of escalating it by telling her she ordered wrong.)

I thank her for the information, assure her I'd get that voided out as soon as possible, but would she please pull around to a parking space so I can get the drinks out to the customers behind her? I'd be bringing her void receipt out in just one minute. She responds to that by scoffing, and yelling to see the manager. ""Oh, I'm the manager. Don't worry, it will just be a minute, I'm really sorry about all this.""

""YOU?? YOU'RE the manager?"" ... She pauses. ""We'll see about that.""

Literally just a few seconds later I get the order voided and run the receipt out to her while my baristas take care of the line behind her. She is on the phone. She sees me there but pointedly turns to face the other direction. I'm left standing there for almost 5 minutes before she rolls down her window and looks at me. ""Here's your void receipt, again I'm really sorry for the miscommunication. If there's anything else I can do to help you please let me know! Have a great day!"" ...She doesn't even respond.

I get back into the shop only to be informed that while I was outside waiting for her to roll her window down, this woman had called the store twice, asking for the owner to complain about the manager. I later found out from the manager at our neighbor store that she had called there, too.

And now she's called several times a day for over a week, trying to reach the owner. Really?? Who has time for all that? Especially considering I was sweet, smiley, and apologetic the whole time; gave her exactly what she wanted; and was well within my rights to refuse her service because of her disrespect. Maybe that was my mistake, actually - being too nice when I should have been all, ""LISTEN HERE - show me some R-E-S-P-E-C-T, lady!!""

Also because I'm not some big burly man that people are afraid of pissing off. -sigh-

TL;DR - Lady orders wrong, wants refund, yells and screams, I ask her to stop and give me the info needed to complete the refund, she subtly threatens my job and calls several times a day since to try to get me fired, people suck.

Thornnuminous,95,,99,1p4bbc,,554,"So, I have mentioned this in comments before but people are asking me to post it as a story, so here we go.

Back when I worked at a Bookstore (part of a chain that No Longer Exists due to the owner family suing themselves into oblivion), we would get some really weird calls.

One day, I answered the phone to this:

Me: Good afternoon, this is Tiara Books, Thornnuminous speaking. How may I help you?

Dude: ""Uh...yeah...um...do you have any books about masturbation?""

Me: (in my head) oh shit, here we go.

Me: (Out loud, and brightly) ""Why, yes, Sir, we do. The computer shows that we have a copy of Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving by Betty Dodson.""

Dude: (a bit breathy, and slightly startled) ""Oh...oh...you do...could you...tell me about it?""

Me: (bright and chipper, as FAR from sexy as I could manage) ""Well, it's a self help book written by feminist Betty Dodson. She also offers classes for groups in New York.""

I sort of hoped 'feminist' would be a damper, as it sometimes is for jerks who happen to be male. No such luck.

Dude: (breathing heavier, lots of rustling noises) ""Oh...that sounds...good...um....*pant* what else?""

Me: (still brightly but getting a bit brittle) ""WELL...I haven't read it. Do you want to come to the store ((*oh god please no*)) and see the copy?""

Dude: (slight moan, soft pant) ""Um...I can't right now.""

Me: (In my head) Jesus tapdancing christ...

Me: (pause) ""Oh, I'm sorry to say that it seems the computer is wrong. We don't actually have a copy, but I know for a fact the Borders three blocks away does. Have a nice day!""

yddor,45,,113,1cr6tx,,552,"So I just found this sub and thought you'd enjoy my horrific go-to work story: 

  I used to work at a wee shop near my house when I was still at school, you know that kind that just does the basics: milk, papers, fresh rolls, groceries etc. The rolls were kept in a box to keep them fresh, but it had quite a stiff lid and, because a lot of our customers were elderly, people often had trouble opening it. 
  So, one day I saw a man standing in front of it having obvious difficulty so I walked up and asked him, 'Hey, are you okay there? Would you like a hand?', only for him to turn round with NO. FUCKING. HANDS. LIKE HE JUST HAD STUMPS. I HAVE NEVER DIED INSIDE AS MUCH AS I DID THEN.

Clasikrocker5,177,,92,14hxr1,,549,"I work at a computer store that sells Apple products.  We sell lots of iPads and a fair amount of laptops.  So, when a woman calls us with questions about getting an iPad, I'm happy to help her out so she can get the best fit for her needs.

However, she asks every question that could ever be asked about an iPad, as well as every question ever considered in regards to Wifi and 3G.  45 minutes later, I hang up, thinking I have helped her make a final decision.  She calls back 4 more times, each time with ""another quick question.""  In total, I spend 2 hours on the phone with her.

The next day, someone walks into the store.  I can tell she'll be a problem customer, so I go into the back to get some water (I've gained the ability to recognize terrible people from at least 50 feet away.)  When I come back out, she's nowhere to be seen, so I go on helping other people.  About an hour later, my coworker comes off the floor to get a manager.  As he passes me, he says ""This lady's killing me!""  She's been talking to him for an hour about iPads.  It turns out he basically had to repeat everything I had told her on the phone.  She also talks to our manager for another hour, again being told the exact same information.

At this point, she decides she wants to get a MacBook Air, because she didn't realize the iPad didn't have a physical keyboard (?!).  We get the inventory sheets and warranty stuff all set up, and are about to swipe her card when she decides that she doesn't want it because it doesn't have 3G on it.  Someone tells her she could get a mobile hotspot from her cellular carrier if that was important for her.  So she stands at the desk for an hour as she calls verizon to ask them every question ever conceived in relation to 3G mobile hotspot.  

Eventually she decides to go through with the order.  We all think she's left.  However, 20 minutes later, she storms up to the desk, as I'm in the middle of processing a huge iPad mini order, and demands to know why anyone would make a laptop with one USB port.  After lots of ridiculousness with this, she buys a USB hub, and leaves.  About 45 minutes later, we get a phone call from her.

She had read all of the fine print on the back of her receipt after she got home, and saw that we don't accept computer returns after 5 days in cases where people just decide they don't like the computer.  She says, ""Only 5 days?!  But what if there is a manufacturing defect?  What if I need it repaired a month from now?  5 days?!!!""  So I calmly explain to her what a warranty is (at the store, she had purchased applecare coverage after getting a lengthy explanation of what that entailed).  She seems satisfied and hangs up.  At the end of my shift, I bet my coworker that she'll either show up in the store first thing the next morning, or call us as soon as we open.  He laughs and says no way.

We opened at 8 this morning.  At 8:01, the phone starts ringing.  The shrill sound reverberates through the chilled emptiness that is the sales floor on a Saturday morning in December, like a Banshee's screech echoing across the moors.  Behold, it is her.  She has called to complain about the fact that Windows 7 is not the operating system on AN APPLE COMPUTER.  We tell her about parallels (Windows for Mac) and hang up.  She shall surely return.  And we will be ready.

UPDATE (5:31):  SHE JUST SHOWED UP!!!  I'm about to go 'help' her.  I'll update when she leaves.

UPDATE (5:53): So, she came back in saying that she was concerned about the processing power of the 11inch air she bought (because word processing takes up so much power).  She also wanted to know if she could put the different models in her purse to see how they were in terms of size (despite playing on a display model for an hour before she bought it yesterday).  I couldn't handle it, so I said she would have to go talk to someone at the desk across the room, as ""I can't leave my desk right now.""  

She shuffles across the room, and I can see the terror in my colleague's eyes as he realizes the horror which is about to befall him.  He talks with her for a bit, explaining how she is worried about the processor speed and she doesn't think the 11inch screen will be big enough for her eyes, because ""people's eyes get tired.""  My coworker listens to her explain her every thought in deciding how to consider her purchase, and then says she can do whatever she wants with the demo models, but he's going back to the sales desk.  

He then CLOCKS OUT AND LEAVES (so he won't have to deal with her anymore!)  Later, she left, but then walked back in to ask me what the exact dimensions of an iPad retina's screen are.  I said about 10inches, but she had to know EXACTLY how tall it was, so I went and looked it up (the device is 9.5inches tall).  Apparently that wasn't acceptable, so she left without saying anything further.  Oh how I hope this is the end.  I'm sure she'll come on Monday though.",Apple Nightmare,641,talesFromRetail

WinnifredBurkle,105,,124,17ephp,,552,"So I spent some time working for a children's play place and pizza restaurant chain when I was in high school and college. I dealt with lots of crazy stuff (see previous post and comments), but some of the craziest customers were birthday party moms. 

I live in a moderately sized southern town with some overly entitled southern housewives. They were the worst. Not like Pinterest moms now, who go overboard doing everything homemade, oh no. These ladies wanted the best for their kids but they absolutely did not want to pay for it and would throw the biggest fit in the history of fits when given their final bill. 

One particular mom stands out more than others, but some backstory first. We offered different party packages, some with more emphasis on the games and winning tickets and some focusing more on the maze. Two of the packages we offered had pizzas at a discounted price along with maze admission for a set number of kids, and some tokens. The main difference between the two was how many kids were included, how many tokens you got, and wether or not a party hostess helped with your party. 

Before I became shift manager (and sometimes after) I was a party hostess. For the most part I loved it. It was fun to do my little skit with the mascot and cut the cake and I got sweet tips for it, too. Most parents were thankful for the help and the chance to enjoy their child's party. Others were not so nice. 

This mom had purchased the most expensive package. It came with admission for 8 kids with admission discounted for any extras, two discounted pizzas, some
free tokens, the party hostess (me) and interaction with the mascot. Great. I check her in, go over token prices and additional food prices, give her her 8 wristbands for the guests (she assures me that no more than that will be coming) and start to get things together in the party area. 

I find out from my coworker up front that more and more kids come in for this party. At first she tries to sneak them in, but we had the wristbands for a reason (easy identification for who didn't pay) and made her add additional ones to her party ticket. She ended up having FORTY kids total come on her ticket. 

It takes a while, but I get everything set up for forty kids. I check and double check with the kitchen-did this woman order any extra pizza for her gigantic party? They assure me that no, she did not. I ask again twice before I call them back, and the kitchen finally assures me that the two discounted pizzas we talked about at check in were all she ordered. I assume that the other parents were going to order food for themselves and their children, as unfair as that would be, and call them back. 

So the forty kids come back, all flushed and excited from doing the kid thing, and immediately see that there's a problem. None of the other parents had ordered food, and these kids are *starving*. The fatass birthday kid grabs three pieces for himself, because its his birthday and he can do that, which leaves 11 pieces of pizza for 38 kids and all their parents. 

The party mom storms over and asks where her other pizzas are. I tell her that we made all the pizzas she'd ordered. No, she'd ordered more, she insists. 

""Do you think I'm *stupid?* Why would I have forty kids and only two pizzas? You should have know and made them anyway, even if I didn't order them!""

""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we can't just make pizzas without a ticket. I'd be happy to place an order for you, but it'll be a while before they're ready and your allotted time in the party area will be over. I'm terribly sorry, what would you like me to do?""

She blows up. ""Well I would have really liked it to not have an idiot take care f my son's party! I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!"" 

It was a ridiculously busy day and I had at least two more parties to do after hers, so I decided if she was going to act that way, she wasn't going to have a party hostess. I got my boss, who explained he was sorry about the pizzas but we had no way of knowing that she wanted more. (I guess now we could have asked her, but how is that our responsibility? And what if a kid had had an allergy or something and that's why she didn't order more? I mean, who knows.) He offered her hot dogs as an easy way of feeding every guest quickly, but she got even more pissed when she found out she'd have to pay for them, even at a discount. 

I didn't go back to that party until they had all left, but I did over hear her bitching about the fact that they didn't get enough free tokens with their party package. She bought some more, eventually, and flipped her shit when she got the final bill. 

I don't think she realized that my boss included a tip for me (for having to put up with her and her forty guests) in the bill. She probably would have come back and burned the place down. ","""I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!""",676,talesFromRetail

So I get all my glitter and glue and make my way up to the registers. The checkout line is absolutely bananas. It wraps around a long shelving unit that house some cheap trinkets. Lots of families with little kids all anxiously waiting in this huge line. The line moved quickly for having so many people and after about 10 minutes, I was about six people away from checking out.

Then the yelling started. We shall call them C1 and C2 for crazy1 and crazy2. C1 pushed past a family with her giant stroller as C2 pushed after her.

I_try_hardish,91,,101,1irt5f,,547,"I told this story to my buddy yesterday and he said it belonged here...

So I'm a 24 year old white female working at a gas station which is pretty rare around here so I pretty much hear lewd and suggestive comments every day, but this was a first for me.

I work morning shifts alone on the weekends. I'm the assistant manager so during the week I either have one or two people with me so it would figure that this would happen on a Saturday. It was sometime in the afternoon between 12 and 3 when a male and a female walk into my store. It's in the middle of Satan's butthole hot July right now so the first thing I notice when the guy walks in is his long coat. Not a trench coat, just long. I didn't really pay them any mind since I was in the middle of helping a couple of other customers at the moment. I did happen to glance at the car they had just come from and noticed three other guys in the car, all white and around mid to late 20's. They were simply pumping gas so I ignore them too.

So this guy is shuffling around picking up random shit to look at while his counter-part walks to the bathroom in the back. A woman and her son walk in to pay for some gas really quickly so I handle that while still pretty much not paying attention to the guy even though something looked kind of off about him. I check out the mother and she and her kid exits the store, leaving the place empty except for me, coat man, and the girl who must obviously be having some issues because she still hasn't come back out of the bathroom.

I finally shift my attention to coat man and ask him if he needs help or is looking for something specific. He mumbles something I can't hear so I lean forward and ask him to kindly speak up. He says ""yeah...I need some fresh air."" Then he kind of awkward jump/hops to directly in front of me and flings his jacket wide open. This is when I realize what looked so weird about him. He was wearing a long coat but I could still see his bare legs. It just looked awkward.

So there he stands in front of me in his birthday suit with his little noodle still flopping around in a semi circle from his little hop. So I stand there and stare in shock for a solid three seconds and take in this dudes small frame with tiny little milk dud looking nipples and teeny little tootsie roll tinkie-winkie. Then with a force that was physically painful, I burst out laughing.

Now when I say burst, I don't mean I brayed loudly. No. I'm talking about pure, raw, laugh diarrhea that was so forceful that spittle flew out of my mouth. To make it worse for him, I covered my mouth and pointed at him. It was laughter so hard that noise stopped coming out of me and Niagara Falls started streaming from my eyeballs. A look of hurt-shock flashes across his face and a dark crimson color starts setting in. By this time it was too late for me, I couldn't stop myself. Finally the noise caught up with my laughter and I just threw my head back and hee-hawed until I was pretty sure I was going to be sick. 

Hearing all of the commotion, the girl busts out of the bathroom, takes in the situation, and then takes up my laughter with me. By this time the guy is clutching his coat around his body like a nervous first time lover. Through a wave of tears, I see the other passengers outside laughing and bouncing around so much while pointing at us that the whole car is rocking back and forth.

The dude spins around to make a quick get-away and runs face first into the glass door. The girl comes to his rescue and helps his out of the store in a half jog to their car. On the way there he stumbles over the curb. He catches his balance but the back of his jacket flew up exposing his bare white ass. I lost it.

At this point I'm pretty sure my laugh sounds diseased because my vocals were so scratchy and I couldn't catch my breath. I'm pretty sure the guy was crying as I caught one last glimpse of his face during their hurried retreat. It took me a long time to regain my composure. It didn't help that everyone that came in for the next hour asked me if I was ok since my face was all puffed up and my eyes were completely bloodshot. I would tell them what happened and we would have a good laugh together. In pretty sure I lost 5 pounds by the end of the day.

dignam4live,26,,92,1a8zfz,,545,"Hey guys, I currently work at a petrol station that is part of a large chain, I have worked for the company for almost two years. I started at a store close to where I live, but while working at this store my manager was just horrible. I'll call her Sue. Sue would constantly berate me while working, for the smallest mistakes. Mostly for no reason though. Nothing I did was good enough for her, and she was a complete control freak. She would put me down as well, she always asked if I did well in school, and if I had trouble concentrating. When I told her I did well, she said ""I don't believe you, you cannot even understand simple directions, you must have learning issues."" I was actually a decent worker, but for some reason, she hated me.

 If I was at the console keeping an eye on the forecourt, she would yell at me to stock. If it wasn't busy and I was stocking, she would yell at me for not paying attention to the forecourt. It was miserable working for her, not to mention she only gave me 3 hour shifts. The one good thing about working at the store was one of my co-workers, lets call him Steve. Steve was awesome. He was a middle-aged man who was just the nicest guy ever. Really funny and awesome to work with. Anyway, Sue just plain hated me, and was trying her best to get me fired. Eventually I fucked up and made a mistake, so she managed to get me to do a 'Performance Review"" with the Area Manager present. During this meeting, she had listed all the mistakes I made, (the majority of them were during my first week or two, learning the ropes.) She was also claimed I was lazy, never did my duties etc, which was all bullshit. I didn't really contest any of this, I knew I would get a strike on my record anyway. I did. Strike One, three strikes and you get fired. 

They have to give you three written warnings until they can fire you, thats company policy. Unless of course you do something really bad, like steal something from the store. So the next day after the meeting, Sue comes up to me and says ""If I could have fired you now, I would have. Since I can't, I'm going to cut your hours to zero."" So she cuts my hours, but this ends up being a blessing. I have a friend who works for the company at another store, and he gives my number to his manager so he can use me to cover shifts at his store. I cover some shifts for him, and he loves me. He loves that I am flexible and willing to work, and says I am a good worker. He gives my number to other stores, because I have zero hours at my home site, so I'm almost guaranteed to cover a shift. 

After a few weeks, I am working the maximum amount of hours I can work, I have to turn down at least 3-4 shifts a week because it will put me into overtime. I start covering a lot of shifts at the store I currently work at, and the manager loves me, so requests for me to be transfered. Sue, of course approves it, as she is no doubt glad to get rid of me. My manager has no problem with me, and thinks I'm a great worker. Go figure. I am finally free from her grasp, and I now work at a great store, with an awesome manager and co-workers. 

A few nights ago, I start talking to my old co-worker, Steve on Facebook. I haven't heard from him in months. He tells me Sue has been fired. She was fired for abusing customers, workplace bullying and sending abusive text messages to co-workers. Sweet, sweet justice has been served, even if it took almost a year.

sex_camel,82,,115,199p7j,,551,"I work at a casino, and just like any retail/customer service job on a Saturday, we were getting killed. I work the front desk where we issue free slot play, comps, etc, and it was one of those days where the line would. Not. End. As soon as we helped one guest (which, due to our complicated rules and promotions, takes about 7 minutes of continuous talking and explaining for most customers), another 10 guests would be getting in line to hear the same shtick. A normal Saturday consists of about 8 hours of this.
Anyway, a few hours into my shift and with the madness showing no sign of ending, a customer that I had just finished helping was stepping away from the desk. Out of nowhere, this woman rushed up (cutting in line, I might add - a huge pet peeve of mine on nonstop days) and IMMEDIATELY copped an attitude: pointing a finger in my face, she said, ""I had security call me an ambulance, but I don't WANT this ambulance, I want you to call me a NEW ambulance, because the driver of this one is giving me ATTITUDE."" For a second, I was stunned into silence. I mean, I have heard some ridiculous complaints at my job, but this was by far the most ludicrous. My immediate thought was that if this lady was well enough to demand multiple ambulances, she wasn't sick enough to need one in the first place. So I responded ""ma'am, if this is an emergency, you need to take the ambulance that is waiting for you, or call 911 yourself and see if they will send a different one, which I doubt they will do. If its not an emergency, I can't let you cut in front of all these people who have been waiting."" Her eyes bulged madly for a second before she demanded that I find the security guard who had called the first ambulance and ask that security guard to call a second one. I told her that I could not do that either, that security would not call a second ambulance for the same guest. At that point she SLAMMED her hand down on the counter and screamed ""Well if YOU can't do that for me I want you to find someone who CAN!"" I glanced at my coworker sitting at the computer next to me, rolled my eyes, and look back at Belligerent Lady. Before I could even open my mouth she shrieked ""Are you ROLLING YOUR EYES???? DID YOU JUST ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME?????"" To which I calmly replied ""yes I am rolling my eyes at you,"" stood up, and called to my manager to call security. I guess Belligerent Lady didn't think she could get away with bullying the security guards either, because she yelled a little bit more about how she was ""just trying to have a conversation"" with me and this was my (over?)reaction, then she scuttled off.

Epilogue: The same lady came back later that day demanding to see my name tag so that she could ""report"" me. I held it up to her face and said, ""Sure, it's sex_camel, make sure you don't forget the underscore."" (I have an unusual name, so this was particularly satisfying.) Nothing has come of it since, except my coworkers and I all got a good laugh about it later.","Woman demands a second ambulance, after the driver of the first one gave her ""attitude""",666,talesFromRetail
FlameEverlasting,51,,121,1qgxyo,,546,"I was a server at a small town restaurant/steakhouse for five years.  Like everything in Minnesota, it's on a lake.  We get tons of people coming in from fishing and ice fishing. 
This couple was one of them, in for lunch.  I had waited on them a few times before and they had been pleasant.  Not this time, though.

**Me: Hi!  How are you guys doing today?**

**Woman:** (in what I can only describe as Bad Attitude Teenage Sarcasam, even though she was well past forty) **Uh, hungry?  Can we, like, get something to eat?**

I feel like it's important to note that I literally followed them to their seats with menus.  They hadn't quite finished sitting down when I started talking.

**Me: Absolutely!  Are you ready to order?**

**Woman: We haven't even looked at the fucking menus yet!  Would you just get us some beers, PLEASE?**

**Me: Sure.  On tap we've got Amber Bock, Leine's Heff-**

**Woman:  JUST get us some FUCKING BEERS!**

I scurried away from the table and got them two bottles of Mic Golden Lite; a pretty safe bet because everyone up here drinks that.  They seemed fine with that and ordered without much fuss, but very curtly.  

Five minutes went by.  I stopped by to check on them, and they said they were fine.  It was slow and there was only one other table of customers, so I was refilling salt and pepper shakers.  Five more minutes went by.  The man started waving me down from across the floor.  I saw and started over to them, and the woman,- having seen that I was coming,- *whistles* to me and shouts.

**Woman: HEY! Could we get some service over here?**
Not trusting myself to sound polite, I just stand at their table with a bland smile, waiting.

**Woman:  Where the FUCK is our food?!**

I turn and look at the clock.  It's been eleven minutes.  Knowing that she wouldn't believe me if I just said that, I take my book out and show her the time I put the food in, and explain that burgers take fifteen minutes to cook.  
These ain't no fast food burgers,- I hand-pattied that shit myself,- they're plenty thick and really do need to spend all that time on the grill.  I didn't get to explain that, though.  She was furious, and her husband just sat there, looking like he didn't want to get involved.

**Woman: It has NOT been eleven minutes!  It's been half an hour!  We've been waiting for thirty fucking minutes!  You're a fucking liar!  That is NOT the time we ordered!**

Okay, now I'm nervous.  I've never waited on any outright crazy people; you know, the kind of people that you have to eventually get the cops on to escort off the premises.  Wanting to get out of there I tell them I'll go check on their order.  I go relate the situation to the owner, who was cooking that day, and by the time I get done so are the burgers.  She follows me out and watches the ensuing scene.

They're halfway to the door.  Smokers usually go sit out on the front porch, so I didn't think anything of it.  I smile and say that these are their burgers.

**Woman:  I DON'T WANT YOUR FUCKING BURGERS!  WE'RE NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!**

The owner and I are standing there, openmouthed, as they storm out.  They didn't leave money for the beers they had, or the meals in my hands.
The next time I come in to work, however, there is an envelope clipped to my time card with a hundred dollar bill and a note inside.  The woman had come in with it, shamefaced, the next day.  The note read, 

“Yesterday I caused a scene in your restaurant.  This was the result of being in the sun all day, and one too many beers.  I don't mean to make excuses for myself, but I hope you will understand and forgive me.  We love your restaurant, have always been happy with the food and the service, and hope we will be allowed to come again.  I am so ashamed of the way I acted, and have enclosed $100 to pay for our meals and drinks.  The rest is for the poor soul who had to deal with me.  I am so sorry.”

The owners, being awesome, ate the cost of the walkout and let me keep the $100.

tl;dr- woman is awful but then comes in later with an apology and a c-note.

Ratava,79,,132,1bp7g5,,547,"This story comes from my first retail job, as a young man at the tender, impressionable age of 15, working for a pharmacy chain that later got bought out by another, larger chain, resulting in two pharmacies of the same company just down the block from each other in locations all over the country.

On this particular night, I was the only one working the front register, for the first time. I wasn't at the pharmacy, just the cash register, for people who only needed milk or chips orwhatever. We only had two registers anyway, but there was no one else helping me out today and my manager was in the back working on something. It was a slow night, so I didn't mind, until in walked the largest man I've ever seen in my life.

He was probably five hundred pounds, in a tight white t-shirt that had numerous sweat-stains and what looked like barbeque sauce smeared across his expansive belly. Also, he had on extremely short denim cutoff shorts. Yuck.

He came through the doors, saw me standing alone at the register, grinned, and walked right over to me. 

""Hi, is this a pharmacy?"" he asked.

I pointed to the sign over my head, which read, 'PHARMACY IN BACK,' and said, ""Yes, we have a pharmacy; it's in the back."" Our store wasn't very big; I could see the pharmacy from the front counter, about a hundred feet away, tops. If he had just turned around, he would have seen it. He didn't even look up at the sign, let alone turn around to see the pharmacy.

He said, ""That's great thank you, so do you guys like, do tests on pills or something? To see what kind of pill it is?""

That's a question I hadn't yet come across. It was my first night alone, and my impulse was to pick up the phone to ask the pharmacy, but I decided, I could *do* this. I am a *retail employee.*

I said: ""I don't believe that's something we do here. We do have a pharmacist in the back who can definitely talk to you about that, but I imagine you'd have to send it to a lab or something to get tested?""

He said: ""OK because, you know the Internet? Well, I bought ten dozen packs of cheap Viagra, but I'm afraid to take one because what if it's not Viagra, you know? So what do you think I should do?""

I stammered something like: ""Well, you could just take one, and, um, see if things... well...""

He didn't even seem to be listening to my response, just grinned and thanked me for my answer, and then said, without breathing, ""OK I have another question my friend told me about I read online I heard something about... Vibrating condoms. Do those exist? Where can I get one?""

Trying to keep a neutral face, I said, ""We actually sell them here. Not quite vibrating condoms, but condoms that come with a vibrating ring. They're on the condom rack, back by the pharmacy."" Again, I pointed to the sign above my head.

""So how are those?"" he asked.

""Sorry?""

""How are those? Do the ladies like them? You seem like quite the stud, have you tried them out?""

Now, not only was I a painfully virginal 15 year old, I'm also gay, so asking me about ""the ladies"" would not really get you a good answer even now.

I said something like, ""I haven't gotten the chance to try them out yet,"" and reminded him that they were on the rack in the back.

He waddled down the center of the store toward the pharmacy, looking back at me as he walked. When he reached the condom rack, he stopped and looked back. I nodded. He looked at the rack for half a second, looked back at me, and shrugged comically. I tried to motion that they were on the bottom of the rack, but he just shrugged again, and then waved me to come back.

Like I said, the store was very small, and there was no one else there. I figured, what the hell, locked my register, and walked back to him.

I bent down and picked up the two boxed varieties we had and handed him one of each. 

He asked: ""What's the difference?""

I said: ""One is Durex, one is Trojan.""

He said: ""OK, what's the difference? Describe them to me?""

Painfully virginal, gay, and also, naive. But at this point, I realized that he wasn't actually just shopping for vibrating condoms, he was ""enjoying"" having me help him pick them out.

I read off the basic description on the front of the box, which was identical across both brands -- ""Three lubricated condoms  plus one vibrating ring.""

""Which one should I get?"" he asked. ""I'll trust you.""

I handed him the more expensive box.

""Excellent,"" he said, and followed me back up to the register.

I quickly rang the box up and told him his total, but he made no move to pay me.

""So, how do these work?"" he asked.

""Um, it's a condom, plus a vibrating ring,"" I answered.

""OK, but like, how do I use it?""

I picked up the box to read the instructions on the back, to see if there was anything there that I could use so this didn't need to get any more awkward, but the directions were full of phrases like ""base of the penis,"" which I definintely was not interested in saying.

So that's when I said, ""Sir, I'm not going to demonstrate the use of a condom for you."" I reiterated his total, and, slightly chagrined, he paid me.

As he was leaving, he said, ""Maybe these will finally get her off that goddamned pill! How long will you be here? Are you still going to be here in twenty minutes or so? I'll come back and let you know how it went!""

I told him I was actually leaving for the day immediately (even though I still had hours upon hours left), and to have a nice day. I never saw him again.

The second the door whooshed shut behind him, my phone rang. It was the pharmacist. "" *Did that man just have you pick out condoms for him?!* ""

""Oh girl,"" I said, ""You have no idea...""

Pannecake,122,,124,15c2ud,,541,"So yeah... Christmas...fuck that.

I work a Front End Supervision position at a Big Box Discount Retailer (think TJMaxx, Ross, Marshalls, Home Goods) meaning I'm on register all day long and have to moderate breaks and lunches according to staffing and the line.

So its nearly Christmas and we've got a line weaved and wrapped around the store. We have eight registers with all eight people working them (and one register that is completely broken and cannot function). 

I'm running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find the schedule to do a break/lunch check so we don't fall behind on breaks. I figure at this point of everything being completely fucked anyway I may as well get people on their lunches and breaks regardless of the line because I can call any Non-Active Managers (meaning they aren't the lead manager at the time) to run empty registers. 

""Hey get on a goddamn register and help!!!""

I ignore the cries of the waiting customers as I have loads to do other than help impatient assholes.Like schedule checks, hanger runs, and return processing before our returns bins overflow and become safety hazards.

I tell T to go on break as she's over due.Same customer loses her shit.

""What now two of you are off... this is bullshit!!! where is your supervisor""

""Ma'am I am the supervisor. We are all trying hard to make sure this line moves quickly, but understand by law my employees need a break every two hours...""

""Its almost Christmas you should have scheduled more people!!!""

""Ma'am this is the maximum amount of people we can have on. I don't make the schedule or do payroll. Regardless we have only eight functioning registers and right now six are being run, My register and the girl who went on break aren't being run right now because I have other things to do to keep the store safe for everyone.""

""I don't care about safety, I have places to be! Also register nine isn't being run!!!""

""Register nine has to be replaced entirely before we can have anyone run it. The replacement won't come until January or February"" 

""WELL WHY WASN'T IT REPLACED SOONER!!!""

and then a customer who has finally had it with this ratty ass woman peeps up.

""Hey give her a break!!! This woman is running this entire Front End of the store, Three days before Christmas! You should expect long lines and longer waits.... its insane you'd think the lines wouldn't be hell, imagine being stuck up there all day dealing with people like you. In fact if you'd kindly shut the fuck up and let her do her job then the line would move faster...instead you are berating her and keeping her from doing her job so she can get back on register.""

THe woman went silent and I gave the guy a percent discount on one of his more expensive items under a customer service discount.

and two days ago under a similar stress level we had added to it all one register that couldn't do returns because the cashier had fucked up so many of them she had her power to do so revoked. So when the woman in line goes to the cashier who clearly called out ""Register Five is Open, not Returns"" she throws a hissy fit.

""The security guard said wait in line and any register can help me and you are now saying you CAN'T""

""Ma'am I can help you over here on my register for a return.""

Oh lord walk two whole inches to the next register.

""You are all goddamn hoodrats...this is why I don't come to the ghetto to shop.. you are all ignorant (in Utah this means rude) ghetto ass bitches who can't do their goddamn jobs right.""

I process the return with a smile apologising for being a hoodrat ghetto ass bitch. Give her her money and tell her to have a great day, all the while she mumbles about how fucking stupid I am. Then the next person some up, well within sight and earshot of the last customer.

[deleted],47,,120,1bzw2q,,542,"Hi there! I've been lurking here for a while and thought it was time to share some of my stories too.
I recently worked as a sales floor associate in a department store, and although we were responsible for multiple departments, I was often in the toy section. Back around Christmas time, we were swamped with calls from parents asking if we still had certain toys in stock, etc. Most were pretty ordinary, but this one conversation still stands out in my mind. 
I picked up an external call with an older lady on the other end.
""Hi, this is ""Department Store"", how may I help you?""

""Hello, I was hoping you could help me with a present for my granddaughter. Her mother told me she's been wanting a dollhouse, could you tell me what kinds of dollhouses you have available, and what the prices are?""

""Sure, just let me take a look...Well, we have a Loving Family dollhouse, which is about $70, Barbie dollhouse for $100..."" She wants to know what they look like and what they all include, and I describe them to her. 

""Yes, they sound like what she would like...So there's lots of space for her to get in and move around and everything?""

For a moment I'm confused. ""I'm sorry Ma'am... do you mean space for your...granddaughter to get inside the dollhouse?""

""Well, yes, I just want to make sure it'll be big enough for a girl her age, that there's enough room.""

I pause for a moment. ""Ma'am, are you maybe looking for some kind of playhouse for your granddaughter? We have some larger houses for children to play inside, but these are just dollhouses I've been describing..."".

""No, a dollhouse, that's what she wants."" She sounds impatient by now. ""Are these ones not big enough for a 4 year old?""

I realize this woman really doesn't understand the concept of what a dollhouse is. ""Well, this is designed for ages 3+, but Ma'am, dollhouses aren't made for children to play inside. The house is just proportionate to the size of the dolls, the little rooms and furniture and everything are just doll-sized...""

""Well, that's awful expensive if she can't even get in!"" She says angrily.

""Again, we do have playhouses that would be big enough for her to play inside...""

""No, no, her mother said she wants a dollhouse. I don't know. I never had one...Did you?""

""Um...yeah...""

""And you couldn't play in it?""

""Well, no, but I had lots of fun just playing with my dolls in it...""

She grunts. ""Well, maybe they'll have what I'm looking for at Toys R Us...""  *Hangs up*

TL:DR: Lady calls store looking for dollhouse for granddaughter. Gets mad because they aren't big enough for her granddaughter to fit inside.

Vamprimosa,33,,108,1fo28a,,544,"Preface: This story happened a little over a year ago. I work for a small convenience/drug store. Our store is located near the local school for the blind so we regularly have visually impaired customers in our store that we assist.

My throat was sore and my voice raspy at the beginning of my shift, but as the day wore on it worsened. After 5 hours into my shift my voice had gone from raspy, to squeaky, to non-existent. It was extremely difficult for me to even make the most basic of sounds. Not wanting to lose any of my hours for the week, I pushed through and made a sign that I taped to the counter saying something along the lines of, ""I have lost my voice, I will communicate as best I can. Sorry for the inconvenience."" This was working pretty well for most of the customers, most apologizing and telling me they hoped that I get better soon. Everything was running smoothly with no real problems until one of our blind customers comes in.

He was a semi-regular customer who also has Aspergers. It was getting late in the evening and business had died down, I was completely alone at the front of the store. He comes up to my counter and starts screaming ""HELLO!"" as loudly as he possibly can. I try to speak but nothing comes out. He keeps screaming ""HELLO! IS ANYONE THERE?!"" I wind up banging my hands on the counter to let him know I'm there but my ability to communicate stops after that. I push one of our alert buttons at the front register to try and signal my coworkers but no one responds. I'm at a loss for what to do until another customer gets in line behind the blind the customer.

He notices something is off about our interaction seeing as the blind the customer is still standing there screaming ""HELLO! I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME!"". So I motion to the customer behind him in line to read the sign taped to my counter. He reads the sign, stops himself from giggling, and tells the blind customer that I am there but that I have lost my voice. The blind customer then starts to apologize profusely and then starts listing off a couple of items he wanted. I run to grab them then come back to ring him up. This was also an ordeal because this customer always wants to run the card himself but since it is a touch screen, he can't read the responses or feel the buttons. The customer behind him (who was very patient) had to help me guide him through the payment options. He left shortly after still apologizing profusely. My manager came to the front at the tail end of this transaction. He sent me home shortly after.

Definitely my most sitcom worthy story.

Akillician,14,,100,1dtkwv,,535,"I'm 21 and have been working multiple retail jobs for over 2 years. They are both in a mall (a toy store and a candy store cause I love children and not in a creepy way) I feel like working in this line of business makes you bitter towards people in general. However  makes you cherish the truly humble and amazing people that exist in this rotten society. 

I had a guy roll up to my register in a wheel chair at the candy store. We have higher shelves for more expensive candy so kids can't stick their hands in it. He tells me he is making little gift jars for some of his coworkers. He bought a few jars from a dollar store and wanted to fill one with gummy pigs and jelly beans to call it ""pork and beans"" which I found this to be hilarious. He shamefully said he might need help as he had a recent stroke and sometimes his hands don't function and he didn't want to spill anything.  I instantly told him anything he needed help with I would be more than glad to. As I was filling his jars he started talking about anything and everything. He told me of bars I should visit, told me of his past jobs, surgeries, then he went into a bit of detail on why he was missing a leg.  He said he stepped on a nail while helpping someone carry something in his store but was not on the clock. He then contracted a flesh eating bacteria that would eventually take his left leg,  right foot,  and his right eye.  (he said the doctor did a great job with his eye and that's no lie.  I couldn't tell the difference) he said he hated life at that point and had attempted suicide a few times but one day he decided ""why the fuck am I so angry about?  I'm still alive so who cares about that other stuff""  I thought wow this guy has absolutely nothing going for him yet he is still such a positive person.  I finally finished filling his jars and when I rang it up I knocked off like $5 cause I enjoyed his company. It cost him a little over $20 and he paid with $25 and told me to keep the change. I humbly declined and he said it's not up to you.  Cause if you try to hand me that money it's gonna look like you are taking money from a handicapped dude. ""it will barely get you a gallon of gas,  heck if i was you I'd check the ground for some change and go get that $5 deal for Arby's,  damn roast beef is so good"",  I laughed for like 5 min on that comment.  We then talked about the new dead island and bioshock (side note he is around 60 years old).  It really makes these jobs worth working when someone comes along and shakes up your life with such a positive impact.  I didn't even get his name. 

So to the nicest and most humble guy I've ever met,  thank you my friend.  You deserve so much more out of life and I hope someday I can become just like you.",Sometimes you love retail (warning: wall of text),635,talesFromRetail

**WALL OF TEXT WARNING**

This is more of a rant than an actual story but I just had the absolute worst  night of work I've ever had. I work for [redacted.] I can have upwards of 10 duties in one shift. I've gotten used to it, but it can be overwhelming when there's a big rush and I've got 3 calls coming in. I'm very polite to my customers. I'm good at biting my tongue. This being said though, if you really piss me off, you can see it in my face. Once you go too far, I can't help it. However, this is extreme. Not regular bitchy customers, you really have to try to make me this mad. Tonight, I had one of these customers. We'll call her Jill. I have a line of about 6 people, Jill being the last customer in line. Here is how my night quickly went to shit.

I'm checking out the first person in line when I hear some grumbling and moaning. I look up to see Jill sighing and visibly upset. At this point, I'm not thinking she's angry, she seems genuinely troubled by something.

Me: Ma'am, are you okay?

Jill: I'm so SICK of being ignored.

Me: I'm sorry, I don't understand.

Jill: YOU. You're just up there ignoring me. Like I'm not even here.

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm not trying to ignore you. I'm trying to get this line down so I can get everyone through as quickly as possible. Is there something you needed help with?..

Jill: Yes.

Me: Not a problem, what can I do for you?

Jill: Well you can check me out. 

Me: I will be with you as soon as it is your turn. Register 1 and 2 are also open right now, so if they finish before I do, you'll be asked to go over there. 

Jill: but I only have ONE ITEM.

Me: I'm sorry, but the line is first come first serve, not how many items you have.

Jill: and how is that system working out for you?
(Right now I'm wondering what other system she's ever seen used)

Me: we'll be with you as soon as possible, ma'am.

Jill: I ONLY HAVE ONE THING!
(I smile at her and nod and I'm now checking out the person in front of her, meaning she's next)

Me: Alright, ma'am, sorry about the wait. 

Jill: whatever. I need ""fifteeh"" on this gift card.

Me: was that fifteen or fifty, ma'am? (I always ask to confirm, but this time I really couldn't tell what she had said)

Jill: fifTEEN, obviously! Do I LOOK like I could afford fifty?

Me: Sorry, ma'am, just confirming.
(what I'm really thinking is, HOW THE FUCK SHOULD I KNOW?! and had i assumed you couldn't afford it, you would have flipped your shit on me)

Jill: are we done here yet? 

Me: Not yet ma'am, that'll be fifteen dollars.

Jill: I already paid.

Me: I'm sorry, but the screen still says to swipe your card. It must have not gone through. 

Jill: What card? I'm getting a gift card!

Me: Yes, you said 15 dollars right?

Jill: OH MY GOD YES. 

Me: Alright, then that brings your total to 15 dollars.

Jill: I ALREADY PAID!

Me: Again, it says the swipe didn't go through. Could you swipe again please? You'll only be charged once, don't worry.

(She reaches for the gift card and slides it through the credit card machine)

Me: sorry ma'am, I meant you need to swipe your debit or credit card again, or you can pay cash.

Jill: why can't I use the gift card?

Me: You're purchasing the gift card. You need to pay cash or debit/credit for it. 

Jill: UGH. that is so DUMB.

(I apologize, even though I'm not sure how paying for a gift card with the gift card accomplishes anything.)

Me: Okay, ma'am. Here's your receipt with the activation record for your gift card. Bye now! 

Jill: Aren't you going to offer me a bag?

Me: I'm sorry. I don't usually get bag requests for gift cards, but no problem! This is the smallest size we have, will this do?

Jill: You want me to waste THAT much plastic for THIS?
(waves gift card in my face.)

(keep in mind, the smallest bag we have is the size of a regular grocery bag size. and i have no fucking clue why she needs a bag for a gift card. It's already in the little envelope)

Me: Sorry, but that's the smallest size we carry.

Jill: You need smaller bags.

Me: sorry about that, is there anything else I can do for you?

Jill: No. Bye.

Me: Bye! (with a smile).

my manager had been behind me for about 30 seconds to put some more cash in my drawer and heard all the trouble so he smiled at the lady and said ""have a good night""

Jill: Thank you for saying that because I clearly wasn't going to get that from this bitch (points at me)

I freeze. I don't think I even said anything. I was so shocked at what she said. I had been as nice as I could be given the circumstances. This lasted at least 8 minutes or so. I was just so appalled that she could say that. I had tried everything I could to make her experience a positive one. I've been told by many customers that I am excellent at customer service. People remember me, and thank me all the time. I've stayed after hours to help people to their cars and help them find things and I'm happier than any other coworker I have. Jill turned and left. 

I think this is over as she leaves and try to recuperate to help the next customer. After that everything is fine and everyone that was behind her tries to comfort me but I'm really close to tears. I tell everyone to have a good night and then I get ready to take my break because I really need to calm down and get over what just happened.
I take five minutes, have some water and just breathe. I splash my face with cold water to start fresh again. I walk back out with confidence determined to be happy with the rest of the customers.

Lo and behold, I get to my register and Jill walks in.

Jill: I just wanted to let you know that you're horrible at what you do. You need to quit your job because customer service is NOT for you.

Me: I'm sorry but I don't know what more I can do for you.
(I'm really considering calling for back up because I'm not sure I can be near this woman much longer without breaking down)

Jill: It's not about me, I'm trying to help you. You should find another job. You're shitty at this one.
(Normally I can ignore stupid comments, but I felt so harassed and it came out of nowhere.)

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry for anything I did to you but you're really hurting my feelings right now. If there's nothing else you need from me, I'd appreciate it if you left the store for tonight.

Jill: You shouldn't say things like that. You don't know what I'm going through that is making me act this way!

(wtf? nothing is making you act this way.)

(I'm not crying, but I'm sure my eyes are red and my nose is a bit tingly.)

Jill: Oh man up! Jesus, you really aren't built for this job. 

I'm a woman, young, and no. If that's what my job requires, I'm not even close to being suited for it. 

I told her to have a nice night and that I hoped whatever was going wrong in her life worked out for the best. Then I clocked out and got in trouble by my manager for ""telling a customer how you feel"".

My boyfriend picked me up. I got home, got in the shower and cried my eyes out. I'm good now but goddamn people can be evil. Btw, Jill was about 45.

nerveendingstory,117,,125,1lsh0z,,541,"A few years back I worked at a convenience store. I worked there for about 6 months in order to make a little extra money. The overall experience was great. We had regular customers that I got to know and conversed with on an everyday basis. The manager was warm and friendly and was a favorite among the customers and employees.

The store I worked at was never busy but on this night it was packed. I had a very long line of people waiting to check out. A woman walked in and went straight to the side of the desk and just stared at me until I acknowledged her. I look her way and she says, ""The manager told me I could pick up my cigarettes now."" I had just seen my manager before I started my shift and she didn't say anything about a customer coming to pick up cigarettes, so I politely told her that I had no knowledge of this. She immediately gets defensive and goes into this story of how she came in earlier that day and paid for cigarettes and the manager said she could pick them up later that night. I have no idea why anyone would do this for any reason. I tell her without any kind of note or mangager's consent I couldn't just give her a pack of cigarettes. She replies with, ""Oh, it's because I'm black, huh?"" At this point my blood starts to boil. I keep my cool because I am still checking out customers while this is going on. I grit my teeth a little and say, ""Ma'am, You know that's not what this is about."" She tells me to call the manager because she's not leaving without her cigarettes. I excused myself from the customer checking out and called my manager. I explained the situation. She says that she has no idea what this person is talking about, but to give her the cigarettes just to get her out of the store. My jaw dropped. I grab the pack and handed it to her. I didn't say another word to her, just glared. She said, ""Mmm hmmm, that's what I thought."" Watching her walk out of the store, I felt defeated. The customers in line showed a lot of sympathy, one even offered to pay for the pack.

I still get mad just thinking about it to this day. I know why my manager did it, but I lost a lot of respect for her giving in to a liar.","Mmm hmmm, that's what I thought.",666,talesFromRetail
Computermaster,74,,152,1mt2vz,,536,"This is a tale back when I used to flip burgers and fry chicken nuggets. 

Also I'm a male, keep that in mind.

It was my first job. When they brought me in for orientation, manager A (for awesome) asked what I wanted to do. So like any lazy high school kid, I said cashier. So they trained me on cashier and ONLY CASHIER. My first day, manager B (for bitch) stuck me on grill.

To be frank I had no problem with the grill. But since I hadn't been trained on it I had no idea what I was doing, instead relying on my coworkers to tell me how things worked. 

Of course B noticed this and pulled me off grill for my ""incompetence"". I tried to explain but no dice. So she made me clock out and watch all the cooking videos (about 4 times as much video vs cashier).

From that day on, anytime B was manager, I'd be on grill or the fryers. I only got to cashier when A was on duty. B and her posse of sub-managers (also all women) did whatever they could to make things hell for the men. All the cashiers were always women when one of them was on duty (even though everyone is supposed to rotate). 

Well, one morning on of the posse decided to let me run register. Everything went fine until end of shift. Somehow I'm 10 short. Now I am meticulous when it comes to money (yay for being raised poor) so I knew it wasn't my fault. Of course I had no way to prove of because we WEREN'T ALLOWED TO COUNT OUR DRAWERS before starting (which I know now is bad). So I got wrote up yadda yadda yadda. (Despite a girl cashier missing over $20 in one week and not getting anything)

Well the snide remarks and abuse from B and her posse continue for another couple of months and then one day A comes to me. A tells me that I was deliberately set up so that B would have a valid reason to never let me touch register again. I asked A why B didn't like me and she said it was because I ""wasn't pretty enough"".

Well that just blew my gasket. I started looking for another job, and eventually got one lined up. I put in my notice but I cut myself short. 2 days after I put in my notice, B's bosses came in for an inspection. 

I waited for them to get up to the grill, turned to B and this follows:

Me: I quit. 

B: I know that, you gave your notice the other day.

Me: No, I'm quitting right now. 

I then turned to one of the bosses and said

Me: Sorry to go back on my word but I wanted you to know why I'm quitting. I'm quitting because B doesn't let cashiers count their drawers. I'm quitting because she continually asks me to do things I haven't been trained on and then insults me when I don't know how to do it exactly right. But most of all, I'm quitting so that B can hire someone that she thinks is PRETTY ENOUGH to be seen by customers in HER store. Good day to you both.

Of course B went white as a sheet and I heard the big boss say

BB: Back office. Now.

Unfortunately she didn't get fired, (most of her posse was fired or demoted though), but I hear from my friends that work there that everyone is treated better. 

I pop in every now and then (especially when they have that rib sandwich in). Everytime I do she scrambles to the back.

 She doesn't come in usually, but perhaps today she forgot her water bottle. The store is a smallish convenience/gas station, so when two young men started insulting her weight and laughing about how she might ""cause an earthquake"" if she jogs too fast, she definitely heard it, considering she was on the other side of the store. When this girl approached the counter after they left, she looked like she was on the verge of tears. Here's where I try my best to cheer her up:

""Don't worry about them!""

""Huh?""

""I hope in a few months, when you've been at this a while and you're looking nice and skinny, they're here when you stop by. I'm sure they'll feel like assholes.""

nodnarb232001,131,,134,1qy1mf,,537,"A little background- This is my first post here (and on Reddit itself), so, be gentle.
I've worked fast food for the better part of a decade now and make it a point to deliver the best customer service possible (and am frequently complimented by customers on that). In that time, I've seen some crazy displays of the unimpressive parts of human behavior. The following is one of those times.

Working the cashier window, taking orders, taking money, generally going through the day like normal, when a customer hands me a Food Stamp card (they're called something else here, but I'll just refer to them as Food Stamp cards) to try to pay for their food. The total is hovering around $15-16.
In this state Food Stamp cards cannot be used for anything at restaurants, and our registers will flat-out decline the card if it's scanned. There is no way to circumvent that. I have the following exchange with the customer, whom I'll call Cheap-Ass Bitch (CAB).

&gt;Me- I'm sorry, we can't take that card.

&gt;CAB- *smugly* Oh? Why not?

&gt;Me- Food Stamp cards cannot be used to buy food that's prepared for you.

&gt;CAB- No, you can take it. I buy food here with it all the time!

&gt;Me- Ma'am, the register itself declines the card and I can't make it take it.

&gt;CAB- You CAN and you WILL!

(By this time, a sizeable line has formed in drive-through and I can hear people elsewhere in the store 
shouting back towards me that the line isn't move...as if I wasn't aware...)
&gt;Me- Ma'am, we legally cannot accept that card and have no way of using it. Do you have any other way to pay?

&gt;CAB- I AM THE CUSTOMER I PAY YOUR SALARY AND YOU WILL USE THE CARD!!!

(At this point, I'm fed up and have a rare moment where I start to snap)

&gt;Me- Ma'am, do you know how that Food Stamp card works?

&gt;CAB- YOU WILL RUN

&gt;Me- (Cutting her off) That Food Stamp card is funded by tax dollars. MY tax dollars. No. You're not ""Paying my salary"" by trying to use that card, since part of it is the money that I paid into the system through taxes. Now, please, do you have any other method of payment?

&gt;CAB- *taken aback at this uppity fast food drone standing up to her, and sputtering* Fine. Here. *thrusts a $20 at me*

&gt;Me- *takes it, cashes her out* Have a nice day.

tl;dr- If you plan on trying to commit Food Stamp fraud on someone who isn't having it, don't try to play the ""I PAY YOUR SALARY!"" card.

At this time we were a relatively small store in the grand scheme of things and we didn't have shopping carts. Normally not having shopping carts isn't a big deal because we happily hold items for customers on our large rack behind the counter until they are ready. On Black Friday that simply isn't possible. No carts, carry your own stuff etc. 

At 6am I'm in the full swing of things when a lady pushes a cart past my register. I was like 'hold on now, we don't have carts'. Looking closer I could see an arm poking out from beneath the clothes with a hospital band on it! Holy !@#$ there's a person under there! 

That's all the time I get and back to work until she comes to check out. Turns out there is a 300lb man in a wheelchair, passed out, still in a hospital gown (had on pajama bottoms), with his family piling clothes on top of him. Not just a shirt or two. But a few dozen different items.

Pro-Patria-Mori,104,,114,19bytq,,540,"I used to be the assistant manager at a liquor store.  One day the drain of the grocery cooler got clogged (one of those open coolers without any doors that hold 12 packs and 6 packs).  My GM sent one of the stock guys to the hardware store to get 2 huge jugs of industrial strength drain cleaner containing HCl.  

After pouring both jugs into the drain to no avail, the GM then decided to try another cleaning product.  I'm sure most of you are already thinking to yourselves ""there's no way he could be so stupid as to mix bleach with one of the strongest acids available for public sale.  It's common sense to not mix random cleaning products together.  And it even says right on the bottle in very large letters DO NOT MIX THIS PRODUCT WITH ANY OTHER CHEMICAL, ESPECIALLY BLEACH, this is literally the first line of the warning label.""

So, I walk into the store at the beginning of my shift and the entire store is filled with a noxious chemical gas.  My eyes immediately start to water and I can feel it burning in my lungs.  I ask my boss what the hell happened, the GM points to the handy man and says it was his fault, the handy man points back at GM and says it was all his idea. 

Not only did the GM mix HCl and bleach together (line 1 of the warning label).  He then poured hot water into the drain as well (line 2 of the warning label), which created steam and enabled the Chlorine gas to spread throughout the store faster.

In way of apology, he ended up giving everyone who worked that day a $50 bottle of Scotch and some other random bottles of beer and liquor.  

edit: bluerose2 pointed out that it's redundant to say HCl and I exaggerated by saying the cleaner was straight HCl

devmus,62,,120,1ith4y,,535,"A few years back I worked in a high end homewares store. It's a locally owned business that operates about 6 stores in the state. Two of them reasonably large. This day I was at one the large ones.

It had been a pretty cruisey day. Not too many customers around, just enough to keep the clock ticking over nicely. Mid-afternoon this bogan guy walks in looking crazy sus. I think he's probably going to try and pocket a few things so I keep an eye on him as he walks around. A bit of time goes by and he is still walking around the store. I start to feel like I've unfairly judged him as he is doing nothing wrong... yet. Suddenly there's a bit of a rush of customers and I jump behind the second register for 5 minutes to help out. I finish. Look for the guy. He has vanished.

Two minutes later he walks back in with another man. An off duty police officer. The officer was doing some shopping, recognised the guy (he had arrested him previously) and followed him out of the shop. Down his pants he had a few thousand dollars worth of vases and misc glassware. Several HUGE pieces. Thick heavy cut lead crystal. No idea how he got them all down there so quick but this bloke must've been wearing one hell of a belt to keep those pants up...

Heznarrt,93,,116,1ho6yi,,534,"I am a calm person. I have won customer service awards in multiple retail companies. I have been working retail for 4 years, in both sales and management. 

I have worked at 3 different retail companies, but for privacy sakes I won't say their names. Suffice it to say, one was a convenience store, one was a popular electronic retail chain, and the other (where I currently work) is a cell phone store. This event happened a few months ago.

So I'm working in the cell phone store one day (let's call it a Saturday) and it's just me and the new guy. The New Guy knows what he has to do, but doesn't have much experience, so I'm there until 1 hour before we close so the new guy can have closing experience, but with me there in case it gets busy before closing, or the new guy needs help with something. So I bought my ticket for The Evil Dead for an hour after I got off (time to get to the theater, concessions, etc).

Mid-day, 4 hours before I'm supposed to leave, an old woman walks in with a stack of papers. And when I say old, I mean she has a driver/nurse/care giver walking with her (this woman was in her 80s, the nurse looked to be 40s-50s). She has a flip phone, and tells me she wants a smart phone in case she ever gets lost for GPS reasons. The nurse/caregiver/whatever only spoke...well I'm not sure what it was but neither me nor the new guy spoke it. The old woman was Asian, so perhaps it was an Asian language, all I know is that it wasn't English or Spanish.

Anyways, before I can get a word in on usual pitches, she lists a bunch of phones she wants to try. This is where happy normal ends. At each cell phone she asks to try out, she asks to hold it, then asks me to do something on the phone (whether it's to check email, GPS, weather, etc). It would go something like this:

Old Crabby: Can you show me how to launch the weather?

Me: Ok (pushes the weather app icon for her)

Old Crabby smacks my hand

Old Crabby: Let me do it!!!

Yes. She told me to do it for her, then slapped and yelled at me for me doing it. But hey, we make commission in my store, so whatever as long as I get a sale. This went on for about an hour, trying out every single phone in the store. Eventually, she settled on the Galaxy Note because of it's big screen and her vision issues. Then I see her go through her paperwork, and bring out dozens of flyers. As I look, I see that even though there are dozens of flyers, there are multiples. There were only two kinds of flyers in there:

1. The flyer for the competitor, placing the phone at half price than normal
2. A flyer for out store, again showing the Note, for a sale price that's $50 higher than the 1st flyer showed.

She then demands that I give her the sale price of the other store. Now I notice this flyer is for the company I worked for before where I work now (I really don't want to say names, but like I said, this company is a very popular nation wide electronics store). I also realize what kind of sale this is. They'll advertise a great price for the week, and only have 4 units or so per store. So I mention this to her, she accuses me of being a liar, then demands I call their stores and ask for their inventory information. I'm a little ticked off at this point, mostly as she wasted my hour (she knew what phone she wanted) and I just wanted to say ""Well go to their store and leave me alone"". However, I'm management, so I decided to be polite, diplomatic, and take it like a weak new guy in a prison shower. 

I call up every store they have in a 50 mile radius of our store AND this woman's apartment, and everyone is sold out. So she decides to buy it from me (finally, something good out of this).

It takes half an hour to run her credit as she didn't trust me with her social security number, mailing address (although she wanted me to setup her billing too), and...the phone number she wants on her phone. So whatever, I had her call customer service to setup her account over the store phone (because apparently saying it all out loud with me next to her was safer). She gets approved, I go to setup her phone, and at this point she's been in the store a good two hours. 

Old Crabby: You should give me the competitor sale price, that's what you're supposed to do!

Me: I'm sorry miss, but our sale is the only price I can give you.

Old Crabby: But you've kept me here for two hours already! What about customer satisfaction (yes, this is what she said).

Me: I'm sorry miss. But if you want this phone today, the price will be (and I told her the exact price with sales tax).

Old Crabby: Oh fine.

So I setup her phone, get her number sent over, and transfer the pictures and contacts from her old flip phone to her new one. 

Old Crabby: I need you to show me how to use this phone!

So remember earlier she would hold up the display and make me explain every feature while hitting me? Yeah, there was another hour of that.

By the time I was done explaining the phone, she yelled at me for keeping here there 5 hours (yes, she blamed me for everything, and no it hadn't even been 5 hours) and demanded to file a complaint with my manager. That's when I pulled off my name badge, and handed it to her so she could look closely and see the ""Manager"" title.

She said she had to use the bathroom, and walked away, leaving her new phone on the counter. The new guy, who watched the whole thing in stunned silence, looked at me and said ""You know we closed thirty minutes ago, right?""

Yup. Not only was I stuck at work a good 90 minutes past when I should've, but my movie started thirty minutes ago. She comes out of the bathroom, makes me reexplain a few basics, then leads while cursing me. We closed as quickly as we could, and I ended up locking up the store right around the time the movie ended. Luckily AMC agreed to exchange my ticket for a later showing so I could still see my movie.

A few days later, it turned out she was the 1 out of every 100 customers who gets a survey call. She gave me the lowest possible rating because ""he didn't give me the price OTHER STORE NAME was selling the phone for"", as well as other things about how I kept her there, didn't setup her phone, etc. The new employee backed up my store exactly, and my boss, (yes, I am a store manager, this guy runs all the stores in the area), looked at me. Now, this is a nice guy. He doesn't curse, he doesn't say derogatory names, and he's very peaceful, and respectful. He looked at me and said ""Damn, how did you resist hitting this bitch?""

Phishmcz,53,,106,1jwifc,,532,"So I worked at a major electronics chain doing returns and exchanges. This was by far the worst customer I'd ever had in my 7yrs of retail.
An older gentleman came in and wanted to return a tablet he bought for his 18yr old son. I checked it out to make sure it was in working order. It was. (RQ. This particular chain was unable to put your money back onto your debit card if that's how you paid. It would ALWAYS come back as cash, don't know why the system wasn't setup to put the money back onto your card, it just wasn't).
So I grab his $219.99 out of the till and reach out to hand it to him.

Him- No I want it back on my card.

Me- I'm sorry sir our system isn't setup to put it back onto your debit. It has to be in cash, or a gift card if you'd like to purchase something else.

Him- No. I want it back on my card (he reaches out,grabs my hand and puts his card in it)

Me ....Sir. I can NOT put it back on your card. It was to be cash.

By this point we're both starting to get irate and my co workers and other customers are starting to take notice, including my 8.5mo pregnant supervisor who is 2hours away from going on maternity leave.

Him- This is ridiculous! I shop here all the fucking time! The money IS GOING back on my card!&lt;br&gt;

Me- No it's not! It's coming back in cash!

Him - I'm going to call the police and report you!

Me - Sir just take the cash. You have a branch for ""bankname"" across the street. You can deposit it there.

Him - No! I'm calling the police on you and you'll be arrested!

Me - Fine! My name is ""myname"" and please feel free to call them down here
*At that time I had returned his money to the till and slammed it shut. That's also the time my supervisor came over*

Her - Sir please put away your phone. Lets work this out. Now my associate told you it has to come back to you in cash. If you like we can give you a gift card for the amount.

Him - No! It's going back on my card like I told that bitch over there! *pointing at me*

Her - Alright. We've tried to be reasonable. We've tried to give you the money, now that you've threaten to call the police, you've officially turned this into a legal issue and I no longer have to deal with your shit. Here is the number for our legal dept, go ahead and give them a call. I'm about to pop a baby out, and I'm not putting up with you anymore. Here's your tablet back! We formatted it for you.

But apparently, this is where everyone sells their stolen games. This happens at least 5 times a week. Probably more as I'm not there all the time. Last night is a good example of what happens. Guy walks in and we immediately can tell he's going to sell us hot games as they do it multiple times a week and we know who they are. It's always a stack of games for multiple systems, and most of the games are new (every time a game comes out on Tuesday, you can expect them to trade that game in on that day). How do I know they're stolen? Well for one, they're slippery as a greased pig, which means they've had no friction against the plastic sleeve holding the cover art. I used to work at a video store (yes, that one) and putting new movies out was a pain in the ass for that exact reason. Anyway, they also look crisp, smell new, and often times have a bit of excess cellophane from the t-wrapping still attached.

44uglennococo,80,,108,1hb3ra,,534,"Clearing things up - I live in Australia, the day's temperature was above 35 degrees (celsius) as we were in the middle of a heat wave. The aircon above the registers was broken, and the entire store was hell to work in. I'm talking, sweat in places you didn't know you could have sweat.

It on this mind boggling hot day that was I, being young and cheap to employ, was working the registers. These have the long conveyor belt to pull things toward you, and only stop when an object is placed in the way of this laser at the front. Cleared up? On with the tale.

A woman in her middle fifties walks up, we exchange the usual small talk and hello's, she starts unloading her trolley. I scan and bag, and her objects quickly pile up - that's okay, that's why the conveyor belt is so long. I've done all the cold food, now it's onto the cans and boxes. She's put everything on haphazardly, and me being a good little retail slave is properly sorting out groceries as I go. 

Suddenly, I smell the sickly sweet scent of sugar. Unsure of where's it's coming from. Maybe someone dropped a softdrink? I look around, see nothing, continue to scan.

I attempt to pick up a box of cereal... and suddenly realise that something is very, very wrong. The cereal pulls away, strands of brown goop trailing from the box to the belt.

I think it was at this point ~~I swore~~ I cursed the makers of syrup. It was *everywhere* - trailed along the entire belt, with every item from potatoes to toilet rolls stuck. And the smell - because it was so hot, the sweetness was just overpowering. It'd had melted to near liquid and just pooled everywhere.

The lady just looks at me. 

I look at her.

&gt;Me: How did the maple syrup manage to leak everywhere?

&gt;Her: Well... I might have opened it... earlier... to see if it was the right one... maybe the lid... wasn't on... properly.

It was at this point I did the retailer's biggest no-no. 

&gt;Me: You think?

In my defense, I was hot, the syrup was now *on me* and I was mad that due to it being my register, I would be the one cleaning this. Who even opens goddamn maple syrup? To smell it? It's pure sugar, there's not going to be much wrong with it.

Customer lady gets huffy and tells me I should have been more careful with her groceries and then it wouldn't have fallen over. I point out that a) I am yet to even find the maple syrup amongst her ~~shit stacking~~ unique way of item placing and the b) It wouldn't have spilt if she hadn't opened it.

She asks me what she's suppose to do with the groceries '**you have ruined**!!'. I have no idea. I call the supervisor. She calls the manager.

He explains to her that while technically, she damaged store property as she was yet to buy said ruined items, she may do another shop and get the exact same things. And she must pay for those, but [store] would not make her pay for the items already damaged.

She hit the roof.

As the incompetent cashier had ruined her groceries, she must be given a refund, have someone else do the shopping for her because she's already been on her feet for one round, alert the media about [store]'s scandalous policies, have store credit, get all her non-damaged items for free.

She is politely but firmly asked to leave. 

She refuses to, as she has not yet done her shopping. It is re-explained that she must do it herself. She refuses that, too. Manager asks her if she wants to pay for stock she has damaged. Innocent cashier is blamed. Manager becomes mad. He tells her to leave, or he will be forced to post a banning notice. She storms out, having not paid for anything, screaming that she will contact *everyone* she knows to boycott [store]. Manager smiles.  

Meanwhile the culprit of this debacles, the knocked over and leaking maple syrup, has been found and bagged. By me. Who is now sweaty, sticky, and sweet smelling. The rest of the stock had to be thrown out, as literally *everything* had been covered in maple syrup. Worst ever.

so_overit,140,,97,188iy4,,537,"I work for a company that owns several parking ramps throughout the downtown area of my city.  My job is sort of an operations supervisor.  I supervise the booth attendants who are on the front line selling the parking tickets to customers as they enter the ramps, I dispense and track all of the money coming in and out, I coordinate with security and dispatchers to ensure things are running smoothly, and I fix any and all machinery that breaks down.

Tonight there was an event that brought in 15,000+ people.  In addition there were several smaller events, plus your typical Saturday night bar crowd types.  Nearly every ramp we have was completely full.  Tonight was probably in the top five busiest nights in all of my time working there.  Despite that, the night went relatively smoothly until the end.  Most people were orderly and not causing massive traffic backups, there were only minor issues with the machinery, and even the least competent of my employees were keeping their heads together and doing their jobs well.

Then the big event let out.  15,000 people were trying to leave the parking ramps all at the same time.  Inevitably, there are backups in the ramps, and it can take a long time for people to get out.  In this case it was about an hour, which is actually pretty extraordinary for an event of this type.  To put that in perspective, there was an event about half the size last night and it took over two hours for everyone to get out of the ramps.

Security and booth attendants are stationed at all of the ramps to help customers exit.  It may seem like exiting a parking ramp should not be a complicated thing, but thousands of drunken people who are all pumped up from the event that they just left make it very complicated.  

Most people are very excited about the event they just attended and they are happy and joyful and funny (and quite drunk).  Some people are very, very pissed off about how long they had to wait in the ramp to exit.  Most of the pissed off people just make some snide comments about how poorly we are running things, and I just smile at them and tell them to drive safely.  A few people take things to the extreme.

The ramp I was in has two exits on opposite sides.  I had a security officer at the top end directing traffic to each exit.  I was assisting at one exit, and a booth attendant was assisting at the other.  There was one gentleman in particular who drove me to post this tonight.  I have dealt with all sorts of unreasonably angry people during my time at this job, but never have I experienced anyone like this before.

Near the end of the line is this person who is reaching the security officer who is directing traffic.  He is so drunk and angry about waiting that he is visibly shaking.  Even from my spot 20 yards away I can see how worked up he is.  He stops his car, gets out (he is now blocking everyone behind him from exiting), walks up to my security officer, and begins screaming in his face.  He is losing his mind so thoroughly that spit is flying from his mouth as he yells.  I see my security officer about to lose his patience with the guy, so I rushed up to try and diffuse the situation.

When I get to them I ask what the problem is.  The guy yells, ""I'll tell you what the fucking problem is you fucking bitch!"" and cold cocks me right in the face.  He seriously just punches me across the mouth.  Before today I'd never been punched in the face, and I have to tell you that it really, really hurts.

I fell to the ground, dazed, and the security officer jumps on the guy's back to keep him from further attacking me, all while calling for other security to back us up and for a dispatcher to call the police.  The rest of it is rather fuzzy for me as I'm sort of small, and not exactly used to being punched in the face, but the two of them scuffle for a while until the cops show up.  They arrested the guy, and I went off to the hospital.  Nothing in my face is broken, just good and bruised up.  I am also on some pretty fun painkillers.  I told the police that I would in fact like to press charges, and the man is sitting in a jail cell right now as I type this.

toxlab,53,,121,1gxbtm,,529,"I was working in a kitchen that was fairly easy work, had good coworkers, and wasn't a terrible commute. I had been looking for a better paying gig, but I was enjoying my current one, so the search wasn't urgent. 

We got into all manner of hijinks in the back: One of the cooks changed most of the dish names on the computer. If you ordered meatloaf, the ticket read ""Robert Paulson"". A fettucine alfredo rang up as ""Boba Fett"". After a server learned she had an allergic reaction to a dish, it became ""kill amy"". After one very notable evening, a new notice was put on the board. ""Anyone caught making a penis out of pizza dough will be fired"". This led one of my coworkers to spend several hours carving a very *threatening* looking phallus out of a five pound salami. He was a very artistic man, and his medium was food. He made some spectacularly vulgar stuff out of produce. He also almost lost his job after being discovered in the back room, in only his boxers, pretending to hump a dog. But that's neither here nor there.

We had lots of ways to kill time. One night, a server had a fantastic meltdown. We had front row seats as she peeled off her uniform, screaming and throwing things.

One of the cooks asked how we would do it if we were to be fired or quit. At first, it was just all about the show. Yell and scream, talk about bugs in the food, find a person enjoying a meal and ask them if they found any of the pubic hair, etc.
Then they got to me. The gods of mischief came down and laid their terrible bounty upon my head. I had a terrible idea.

""If I knew I'd never be back, I would shit in the pickles.""

Pickles come in a big green five gallon bucket. The slices of pickle are packed tight enough that you never see the bottom until you take a lot of product out. Remove a large pan full, take a dump, and cover it back up. No one's going to see it until they hit the bottom. And the size and positioning of the bucket are so that you could easily, comforatably take a poop in it and not be spotted. And you would be long gone. 

Everyone was silent for a moment. Then I heard, ""you won"". 

From then on, it became my go to phrase. Have to work over? ""That's it, I'm shitting in the pickles!""  Need something more from the walk in? ""I'm gonna go look at the pickles for a minute."" Pretty soon, ""pickle"" became code word for anything extra frustrating.

One thing we hate the most, which he did, is when people lurk right at the register and pester us with every item, ""How much is this? How much is that?""  To make matters worse was that he was on his phone talking loud enough for the whole store to hear him cursing and carrying on.

After half an hour or so I finally got done with everything and could only buy about 15 cds out of 200 and offer him 9 dollars or so. Almost everything he had to sell us looked like he ate his dinner off of.  Scratches, soda spills, hair, and what looked like an actual bite into a disc.  I tell him the breakdown of what I can take and what I can't along with the money he would be receiving.  Of course he was upset and put up a fight over what albums I passed on and what I was paying for the ones I was taking.
""Why aren't you taking this? This is a great album"" (then why are YOU selling it if it's so great?)
""I'm only getting a dollar for this? Can't you make it three dollars instead?"" (I can't go any higher, I can totally go lower if you'd like)

mchapman26,89,,90,1d2wbu,,528,"So I was waitressing last night (normally I bartend but I opt to waitress Wednesday nights for more hours/money....I've posted twice before but don't know how to add those links like you smart people, and I'm on my phone)....

Like I said, I was waitressing last night and I got my butt kicked. I was the only waitress and in walks the entire girls softball team and their parents, on top of my 6 other tables. It's tradition that the high school teams get their food free so they always come in. We're happy to serve them and they're great, except for the softball girls. They NEVER tip. I even heard one say last year that they don't need to tip because they get their food free. Well this won't fly with us (the owner said we do it for the community so we shouldn't worry about tips....) so the owner's son last year finally said something to them because when you don't get tipped on helping 15-20 high school girls you get mighty surly. Anywho, they actually tipped me $12 last night and their tab was $85 so I was content with it (there was 15 of them and someone left a $5 so that's not even all of them tipping $1. Sweet girls huh?). 

15 minutes after the girls leave the boys baseball team walks in.  I want to cry until I realize their parents aren't coming. I love the baseball team. I love them because they're nice, funny and they tip phenomenally. Last night was a perfect example. They tipped me $55. Yep, 55 freaking dollars. Why? Because they're nice boys and realize that they're getting a free meal so they over compensate.  They made my crazy busy night oh so worth it. 

TD;lr: softball girls left me $12 for a tip on a free meal. Baseball boys left me $55 on a free meal. Baseball&gt;softball.",Baseball boys v softball girls,618,talesFromRetail
Ralkkai,85,,105,1jfn9h,,529,"So I used to work at a gas station...

I worked third shift at a gas station while trying to finish my stint at a community college. As a lot of the folks here at TFR may know, third shift at a gas station isn't the most glamorous of jobs. Had my fair share of shop lifters, beer runs and the occasional gas drive-off, sometimes with the nozzle still in the car's tank. 

One particular evening, around the beginning of the summer, we had a group of teenagers come in, all looked to be around 16-18. After ringing some of them up, I get interrupted by one of them who had just come in. 

Teen: Hey, I don't have my ID with me but I'm 18. I promise. Can you sell me a pack of  Marlboro Blend 27's?

Me: Nope.

(For clarification, in the US, you have to be 18 to purchase tobacco products. Also at this gas station chain, the rule of thumb is, we need to ask for ID if they look younger then 30, or best judgment. Also other gas station/retail employees reading will probably be familiar with the constant scare of secret shoppers.)

Back to the tale...

He argued about it with me for a few minutes and after realizing that I was without any reason of a doubt, going to refuse him service, He said in a very snotty way “Well fine then. I'll just have my girlfriend buy them for me when she gets out of the restroom. He then storms out and stands very visibly in front of the store.

His girlfriend comes out and heads outside where they talk briefly. She goes to the car they were driving, grabs her purse and comes back in.

Teen's GF: Can I get a pack of...

Me: Marlboro Blend 27's?

Teen's GF: Yeah.

I explain to her that neither my co-worker, nor I can sell her the cigarettes since we know she is buying them for her boyfriend that cannot prove his age.

She, understanding says: It's ok then, and very politely starts to head out.

The boyfriend was watching the whole time and jerks open the door and yells: Oh you're not going to sell her cigarettes now? She has an ID!

Me: Since I know, as you previously mentioned, that she was buying them for you, it is my job to refuse the sale. I can refuse any and all sales I deem necessary.

Teen: Well fine then, I'll just take my business elsewhere. (Again, real snotty.)

prettypanzy,195,,147,1gbtph,,523,"I work the drive-thru of a sandwich shop and I submitted a story about this same drive-thru before actually [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1b7kvu/my_drive_thru_blowup/). 

Anyway, this older woman and her friend drive up at around 9:50 at night (we close at 10 so I'm pissed off already) and orders a footlong sub, she orders the right way because there is a certain way to order your sandwich at this place, and I'm like okay, this is going to be a breeze, she knows how to order. 

Then she says, ""Oh and I have a separate order.""

Me: ""Okay what would you like for the second order?""

Insane Bitch (IB): ""I'd like two 'regular' tunas on 'regular' bread with EVERYTHING on it...""

Keep in mind that we have like 6 types of bread so I just assume that she wants white bread...

Me: ""Alright ma'am so you want two footlong tunas on white bread?""

IB: ""NO.... I  *said* I want *WHEAT*...""

I'm just like... -_- seriously... here we go...

Me: ""Okay... Sorry about that, and do you want to include the jalapenos on your sandwich as well?"" (We have to ask this, because some people don't realize that everything includes the jalapenos...)

IB: ""ALRIGHT, WHY ALL THE QUESTIONS... I SAID EVERYTHING, I MEAN EVERYTHING..."" 

Now I'm beyond flabbergasted that she's acting this way over two sandwiches... so I just say,

""Okay ma'am sorry to bother you with my questions, but I am required to ask them so we make your sandwich to your specifications.""

IB: ""Okay, well, just tell me the total...""

I tell her the total and tell her to pull up to the first window. Her friend in the side seat gives her her money and she pays for her sandwich, then I tell her the total again, and two footlongs at this particular store costs like 15.67 or something, so I tell her and she gives only 15.

Me: ""Um ma'am I need .67 cents or a dollar...""

IB: ""Why the hell does it cost so fucking much?! I just order two REGULAR TUNAS.""

Me: ""Well, two regular footlongs cost 7.31 plus tax...""

IB: ""Are you fucking kidding me?! I ORDERED TWO SIX INCHES............ You know what, just give me the fucking money back!""

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, do you still want us to make the first sandwich?""

IB: ""Well, she fucking paid for it didn't she?"" 

*You bitch....*

Me: ""Okay, it will be out soon please pull up to the 2nd window.""

So, we make the first sandwich for IB's friend and I tell my coworker that I want her to come with me and hand out the sandwich to her because I'll get bitched out more and I need some support.

My coworker and I go to the window, which by the way the lady is fucking pounding her fist on the glass for some reason because she's mad I guess and clearly insane, and me and my coworker are both standing there when she starts ranting.

IB: ""Is there a manager on this premises? I want to talk to a fucking manager! This is the WORST service I HAVE EVER HAD. That INCOMPETENT *FUCK* IN THERE SHOULDN'T BE DOING ANYTHING IN SERVICE BLAH BLAH BLAH.....""

This bitch was literally saying all this shit like I wasn't STANDING right there. Ugh man. And her little friend in the side seat was nodding her head in agreement the whole time like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m37l2kbHzI1qihztbo1_400.gif). 

Coworker: ""No there isn't a manager here right now, but I could give you the office number and you can call them between 9-5 on any week day....."" 

Then she cuts my coworker off and yells, 

IB: ""YOU PEOPLE COULDN'T GIVE TWO FUCKS COULD YOU.""

She then proceeded to snatch the sandwich out my coworkers hands and literally SKID out of the parking lot. And this was an old fucking lady. I swear if I am that angry when I get older I'd just commit myself to an institution, because that shit is just unacceptable. Damn.

It was a great story to tell though and now we just laugh about it, but damn. People and their food are not to be messed with. 

ALSO: SORRY IT'S SO LONG

EDIT: To all the people saying that I shouldn't be mad that they came at 9:50 because it's fast food and they should be gone by 10. Do you understand what it takes to close this store? Also, we have to be out in 30 to 45 minutes or WE get in trouble, no matter what the circumstance. It's bullshit. Also, at this particular drive-thru when people order, it TAKES FOREVER. It's a process, and if someone has more than one sandwich AND doesn't know how to order, it can take 10 minutes or more AND we have to hand make each sandwich after that. So it's not really *fast*.

So I walk into a convenience store yesterday, buying myself a Gatorade, it was hot out. I walk to the register and see a guy standing there, as I walk closer it hits me, the smell of alcohol was overpowering. The gentlemen was standing swaying. Oh wonderful. So I stand behind stinky trying to breath through my mouth but I can taste it, great, alcohol contact drunk, is that a thing? So this guy is being very rude to the lady working, saying, ""hey I gave you 11"", she says he only gave 10. Which he did, and just being a general dick to her. So this wonderful stinky human finishes up and I go pay or my Gatorade an chat with her. Came in last night plastered to. 

I walk to my truck to leave, and I watch stinky stumble to his car, get in and drive away. Oh boy. My day is made. So I call up my local police give them the description, and basically walk the police to him through the dispatcher as I follow. The police cruiser finally tracks is down, and pulls stinky over. Dispatch asks me to hang out and wait if I can. Well of course. I pull bak a few car lengths and watch. I watch the guy blow into the breathalyzer. Get pulled out of the car, get put in handcuffs and argue with the cops. Off to jail he goes.

JacOfAllTrades,110,,126,11c8l2,,521,"I work in a high end home furnishings store, which is unfortunately located in a mall, meaning we get teenagers. &gt;.&lt; Most of the time they just wander in and pretend they can afford something until you ask if they need help, at which point they quickly bolt out the door, but this story starts with a group of teens that evidently were raised without boundaries. I'm somewhat notorious in the store for not tolerating boorish behavior (any more than one MUST), and when these kids came in, I was called over the headset to keep an eye on them.

At first, they poked around like most do, but within a few minutes they were hiding in the hanging rugs and drapes on flappers. Due to the fact that the flappers have large metal handles that protrude out of the cove, this is actually somewhat dangerous, and, frankly, if you are older than 3, don't expect to get away with that. I walked over, gave them my very best put-upon look, and said, ""You are in a place of business, either respect that, or leave."" They seemed incredulous, so I followed that up with, ""Now."" They all came out from between the flappers with the classic 'Mom's Nagging' looks on their faces, but they went back to poking around... for a couple of minutes.

I suppose they thought I had stopped watching after scolding them, but once they disappeared around the corner toward our display beds, I waited about 30 seconds before following. 30 seconds. When I came around the corner, all of them were IN (as in under the covers and all) a display bed: more specifically, in the ALL WHITE bed. Oh, temper temper.

At this point, I was done amusing them, and I walked over, threw back the duvet, coverlet, and sheets, and went full mom on them, pointing to the far corner of the space and ordering, ""Out! Right this second!"" They laughed, so I smirked right back, then called over my headset, ""Call the police, we have destruction of property."" Oh, their faces went pale.

This is where the explanations began. 

1: ""We didn't hurt anything!""

""This is $700 of white bedding you just stuck your nasty, dirty bodies in, shoes, greasy hair and all. You get to explain to your parents why you owe this store money.""

2: ""Come on, we're sorry! Let us go!""

""Too little, too late. I told you once, respect my business. You can't respect that, you pay the consequences.""

3: ""You're bluffing, security will just kick us out.""

""I didn't tell them to call security, I told them to call the cops. I'm friends with the cops here, and the damage is over $500, you wanna bet all you're getting is kicked out?""

The fourth one had enough fear or sense to keep his mouth shut. By chance, the main mall officer (who is an actual cop for the city, there are generally 2 in the mall at all times, if not more) happened to be outside in his car, and I spotted him through the window as he was coming in to respond. Fortunately, he also spotted me and the four trapped children, and I saw the smirk that said fun was about to happen.

He made them all sit on the floor while he wrote up a report on the damages, and when one teen spouted off, ""I'm outta here!"", the officer put his hand on his cuffs and said, ""You wanna rethink that!?"" All in all, these kids had to sit on the floor for the better part of an hour, then the officer said they were all going to jail. At this point, both girls started bawling, and one of the guys looked like he might.

It was really really hard not to laugh.

The officer told them he was going to run a background check on all of them, and if it was a first offense, he *might* not take them to jail (all fictitious, of course). He escorted all of them to the holding facility in the mall, spent about 45 minutes shopping in my store, then eventually called their parents. 3/4 kids were made to apologize to me and the officer by their parents, and each parent chipped in money to pay for the damages.

Now before anyone tells me what a crotchety old woman I am, I'm 22 years old, and these ""kids"" were 16 and 17. If I had ever even thought about acting like that I would have got my butt busted, and the fact that these kids collectively decided it was fine is just sad. But, for whatever else I can say, I can honestly say I am remorseless on this one.

narelie,156,,109,1qp37f,,524,"Due to my apparent obligation to tell this story, I'm doing my darndest to now deliver. Its not delivery though, its NarGiorno. 

---------

I had been scheduled to secret shop a nearby fast food chain location, for the breakfast rush. This is a popular time to check things, because its a prime time for customers. 

So I get started on my order, this time I'm doing a drivethru one. I place the order, and the girl is actually...quite rude. Doesn't offer a combo size upgrade (this is HUGE for these guys), doesn't ask what drink I want, doesn't even tell me what my order total is. She just immediately tells me to pull up to the next window. 

Oh, this is a lovely start. 

There's like three cars ahead of me, so I sit back to wait, and it takes a surprisingly long time...about ten minutes. For a breakfast *rush*, this is **bad**.  As a baseline, you're supposed to have something like 60-90 seconds per car. I get to the window, and they just yanked my card out of my hand (another ding, they're supposed to greet you and tell you your total again), and tell me to pull up to the curb ahead, and they'll bring my food out when it's ready.

This is a huge no-no, because it screws with the times recorded for their drivethru. They're failing miserably, and they know it, so they start to do this to try and fake good times.

My order arrives another five minutes later (bringing this all up to...about 17 minutes. For a breakfast sandwich.), and I'm not terribly surprised to find out its made completely wrong.

I park, write down on the form what transpired, record my times, and head inside with them, and my sandwich. You see, for this particular one, I have to get manager signatures to confirm that I did, in fact, go there. 

As I went inside, I immediately just hear this...piercing laugh. The dining room's almost empty (not surprised, most hit the drivethrus so they can get to work asap), and there's employees chasing each other around. They spot me, and one of them does a leaping slide across the counter, and then grins at me.

....I held up the forms and the grin just...fell.

He called the manager on over, who was holed up in the back, and she scowled and muttered as she read over the form. ""Oh really. OH REALLY. REALLY. Oh look at this.... Someone woke up this morning with a stick up her @$$...""

...SAY WHAT.

I inform her to sign the form now, as I need to get back, and she does, then literally chucks my copy back in my face. 

Forget the sandwich, I'm leaving.

I stalked out the door, seriously angry at what happened, and honestly, annoyed at the fact that I'm going to have to rake them over the coals for this. 

Which, I did. I was straightforward on my report, didn't embellish, and I *still* got a call back from my rep, asking if I was telling the truth. I assured her, it was all true. She was shocked, but admitted that this location tended to not have the greatest reports. This one though, took the cake.

Fast forward a month, I'm asked to shop the location again, but this time, dinner rush.

I get things started as normal, did another drivethru this time (was in a rush, hehe), and they did a bit better this time. Still forgot to offer the combo upgrade, but the drivethru girl was quite polite, told me the total, etc. 

I drove up to pay, and hooooly cow. IT WAS THE BREAKFAST MANAGER. They'd apparently switched her shifts on me! GAH. 

She immediately recognized me, and started squalling. ""ITS HER."" Turning around, she grabbed a poor teenage boy working the drink machine, and yelled ""You handle her, I can't do this right now."" Aaaaand, then she up and left. I could hear her freaking out as she walked all the way into the back.

The poor boy was obviously super confused as to what was going on, so I tried to be as nice as possible. 

The shop went pretty well, all in all, so I went on ahead and filled out the report, and headed inside to get the manager's signature. I was praying very, very fervently that maybe Breakfast Manager was just working that night, maybe she wasn't the manager on duty.

Noooope.

It took them five minutes to convince her to come up front, and then she started cursing at me and saying I'd gotten them all in deep trouble. ""Do you know that you got two people FIRED?! How do you sleep at night!"" Lady, I'm sorry, that's not really my fau--""Oh sure, SURE it isn't. Stupid shoppers, they always pick a *itch to do them. Well here you go, hope you're freaking happy with yourself. You got us all in trouble, and now they're crawling up our @$$ because of you!""

At this point, every single one of the employees turns and looks at me with huge eyes. One guy pipes up ""That's...the shopper?! That's why the DM came down?""

Yeaaaaah, time to scram.

Made my second report, and again, rep called to see if I was making things up. Nope, it went well, except for that psychopath of a manager. My rep was floored, and informed me apologetically that since I'd been recognized so easily, I could never secret shop that location again. Honestly? I was relieved at that. 


Well, its been a long time since...and unfortunately, psycho manager still works there. I had a friend go in to check a few months ago, and yep, she's there. Does she still hold a grudge? Ha. Said friend's order was made wrong, and he made a joke about ""Well at least I'm not a secret shopper."" Apparently, the manager JUMPED at that, and proceeded to regale him with her version of events about ""the *itch who tried to get the place shut down.""

Yep. I can never go back now. :(

It seems our main customers (for clothing) are older people. This story was from when I worked in menswear and lingerie/sleepwear.

There are a few stories I could tell you, but one stands out in my head, so we'll start there...

I was on the till serving customer after customer with no real effort on my side until I get a little old lady asking to return a night dress. I give it a quick once over and ask her what is wrong with it. She says it's the wrong size, which is fine, so I put the refund through and off she goes.

Later, I took the night dress over to where we 'process' all refunded items and hand it over to a colleague. I was half way back to the tills when I heard her scream ""OH MY GOD CLGRV THERE'S SHIT UP THE BACK OF IT.' 

I literally ran across the shop floor back to the refund desk to see that there was a small splodge of crap on the inside of the nighty and a thin line of it leading down to the bottom.

I was totally shocked.  I've been yelled at, called names, and insulted in my years at retail but nothing made me feel as low as the way that woman said 'just the help'.  It dripped with contempt and disdain.

It was a slow night around 7pm, I didn't feel like doing much so I was screwing around making flowers and dragonflies out of the ribbon we had behind the counter to rap gifts with. Mainly cause I didn't feel like doing what my boss had told me to do (sizing all clearance lingerie) because everybody knows that the clearance part of ANY store is a shit storm so fuck that noise I'm going to make cool shit out of company shit.

Doing nothing when the phone rings. WOOO!!! Something to do that I can stand around doing nothing while actually!!!

""Hello this is HowlingBukowski in Lingerie Dept, How may I help you?"" In the most sickly sweet voice I can muster.

""Hey...uhhh I'm looking for uhhh...present for my girlfriends birthday.""

 Now to set the stage. The voice on the other end was male, anywhere from 20s-40s, low and soft spoken, shallow breathing (as noted by the *breath* in the sentences)

""Of course sir, we have that.""

This is where shit gets weird and I realize what the fuck is going on....His breathing is super audible, very low somewhat gruff voice and I'm a moron.

rumplesplitskin,22,,87,11g79o,,524,"We had a really lovely old woman who came in about twice a week to our petrol station. Now she could not bend down to use the air pump to fill her tires so for the past few years when i've not been too busy with anything else i would go out and do this for her. While filling her tires we got to chat and became quite friendly. (Note: I'm a six foot heavy set guy with a shaved head) When she came in i would call her my purple granny. As she like other pensioners died her hair that shade of purple that they seem to like and she would reply with at least she had hair. She would even come into the shop and bring in treats for the staff but gave me extra like a granny would to her grandchildren. All in all she was one of those rare customers that would brighten up even the most dull days. 

A few months ago she told me she was moving down south to England to live with her son and this would be the last time we would see her but she promised to write to us to keep in touch. Well true to her word she did write to use once a week sending up pictures of her with her son and grandchildren. Then today a package came addressed to me personally and i did not recognize the handwriting but by the post code i knew where it came from. My heart sank as i feared the worst, It was from her son informing me that his mother passed on in her sleep last week. He went on to thank me and the other staff for helping out his mother and more importantly being her friend. He went on to tell me that she knew she was dying for the past year and talking to me in that time plus our weekly letters gave her something to take her mind off the situation. 

Inside the package was a framed picture of her holding a air pump in a garage down there and written on it was the words ""it's not the same without you baldie"" Well i burst out crying as i am just now typing this. At the end of her sons letter was an open invitation to come down and visit with his family. All i need to do is let him know and he will send me the train tickets. I wrote to him as soon as i got home today so with luck in a few weeks i can go and pay my final respects to my purple haired granny.

ktarpey,152,,104,1bfz1y,,514,"I work in a grocery store for the seafood counter.

A couple months ago, I was working a closing shift when a couple of college-aged guys came in asked me several questions about the king crab legs. I was low on stock and told them that what I had out in my case was currently all I had left, and that we should be getting another delivery in the next day. They talked for a while and then asked me for five pounds. I filled the order, wished them a nice evening, and sent them on their way. The whole interaction took probably about 15 minutes.

Ten minutes later, my night supervisor stormed back with the bag of crab in hand, and proceeded to slam it down on my counter (in front of a few customers) and tell me, ""Next time you do something like this,"" (pointing at the crab legs) ""you need to tell me first.""

I was actually speechless for a minute before I asked him, ""Do what? Sell crab legs?""

He tells me that the two guys had tried to walk out the door without paying for the crab legs (about $80) and when he confronted them they actually tried to fight him over it. 

At this point my face is bright red and I am being forced to ignore my customers to listen to this lecture. I apologize to my manager and tell him that I didn't realize they would try to walk out with it. Realize that the seafood counter is in the very back of the store, and I can't even see the checkstands from it, much less the doors. 

He tells me that next time, ""if you sell a lot of stuff like this to someone who looks like they can't afford it, you need to tell a manager"". And then he walks away.

I was almost in tears at this point, and my customers that had been waiting just shook their heads and told me that they didn't know how I was supposed to know if someone could afford crab legs or not.

There hasn't been an incident since, although I do normally call ahead to the checkstands now if I sell lobsters, so the checkers know they're coming, but I am still kind of in shock that I'm supposed to be profiling customers and informing a manager if someone that's ""too poor"" to buy seafood is trying to do so.

the-d-man,101,,118,18m6xq,,519,"Lets start off with some context

I work for a membership based retail chain that has gas stations at some of our locations ( any guesses yet?) The Gas stations are all pay at the pump, no cash at all and there must always be an attendant at the station whenever it is open. The main job of the attendant is to sit there and push a button that approves the pump for the member to fill up their vehicle.

Ok now that we got that out of the way..

A little while ago, I was doing my shift at the gas station. Normal day people coming and going no problem. Then this guy calls me over because the card he was using was not working in the pump. 

NO biggie, this happens all the time, sometimes they just need to flip the card around. I go over to help and sure enough he is putting the card in wrong. I explain as nicely as I can how to do it properly but while doing so I notice that its one of our Membership/Credit cards and the picture of the person on the card was of a women. I looked into the car and saw no women. 

I asked the man if he had another form of payment since I could not let him pay with another persons credit card because it is against the law. 

He smiles and explains he has ""authorization to use it"" whatever that means. I explain to him that our laws dictate that the person must be present to use the card and that I could not accept him paying with that card .

He gets a little angry and insists I just turn my back on him and let him fill up since he does not actually have to hand me the card, he can just swipe it at the pump. 

I explain that even if I did that for anyone and the card just so happened to be stolen, the police would trace the card back to the last purchase, find out it was here and use the security cameras to see who used it and see that I looked right at the card and continued to allow the purchase to go through. Which would lead to my termination. Something which I am not willing to risk for anyone. 

He then blows his top and screams at me to go ""back to you little fuckin hut and shut up, I am going to swipe this card and pay for this purchase and there is nothing you can do about it shit head"".

I put on my calm smile and remind him that I have to click a button tha t approves his pump and no matter what, I will not be pushing that button while he is using that card. 

thats when it happened. He turned to me came storming up to me and screamed in my face "" you sir, are the biggest ASSHOLE on the entire fucking planet! Fuck you and your little fucking button"" 

I couldn't help myself at this point. I just chuckled and said "" seriously?  on the entire planet? that is quite the accomplishment! Have a great day sir"" 

He got back in his car and peeled out of there. A few other people who were filling up just looked at me and laughed. 

So there you go folks. I am the Biggest Asshole on the entire planet. 

Do I get some kind of trophy now?

Guy wanted to pay for gas with credit card that didnt belong to him. I denied him and he knighted me the biggest asshole on the entire planet. ","Bow down, for I have been awarded the title of ""Biggest asshole on the entire planet""",637,talesFromRetail
flimflamthezimzam,100,,115,1j2uax,,518,"Here is another one the stupidity of some people amaze me.

Once again small jewellery store in Canada

We sold a line of sterling silver jewellery and synthetic gems that was very popular mostly char bracelets. People would go insane over them, even if they hated them. A lot of people (mostly eastern Europeans and Asians) would not buy sterling silver, white gold or anything less that 18k gold and would get really mad if you showed it to them. Now this line was only sterling silver and nothing else.

I'm showing a lady a bracelet and after a little bit hilarity ensues. (C for customer zz pour moi)

C: does this line come in gold

ZZ: No sorry this line is exclusively in silver

C: well why the hell do you even offer it then anyone who can't afford gold is not good enough to wear jewellery 

Now a lot of people do not know lots about gems or metals and that okay and everything but the following stupefied me.

She proceeded to tell me that every thing she's wearing is 24k white gold (this is not possible gold has to be alloyed to turn white).

C: anyways make me this bracelet in 24k white gold

ZZ: Umm I'm sorry miss but I can not 24k white gold does not exist it has to be alloyed and usually it's coated in rhodium.

C: what are you retarded? gold can be any color even green and black (this is true but once again it is alloyed and cannot be pure). Your obviously not good enough to know this. I want to speak to your manager your HEAD manager no middle managers.

Now here I'm kinda trying to not laugh

M: How can I help you miss?

C: he does not know what he is talking about I want this bracelet in 24k white gold.

M: Ummm miss i'm sorry but that does not exist it has to be alloyed to be white.

C: No stupid it does not anyways show me this ring here.

This ring was beautiful and had Dematiod garnet (green garnets). I'm not our gemologist but the next best thing here I face palmed hard

C: These emeralds look weird

ZZ: those are actually Demantoid garnets these specifically are from russia.

C: UGHH you are so stupid garnets are red

ZZ: actually they can come in a few colors

C: that's not true what are you going to tell me sapphires can be orange next?

ZZ: Sapphires come in every color except red orange ones are called parapadash 

C: F*** your stupid i'm obviously to smart for this store i'm never coming here again.

Aidernz,108,,90,18mkzg,,520,"This is my second post in this very cool subreddit.

As explained in my first post, I work in a produce department for a rather large supermarket chain in New Zealand and have for about 6 years. I have many stories :)
This little incident happened a few months ago...

So I was filling the shop (what we call it when we walk into the department in the shop, find things that need filling eg bananas, lettuce etc, write it down on a list, go out the back of the department, put the items on a flat deck, wheel it into the department and start filling the gaps). As I was doing so, I noticed a woman ""trying"" the grapes. Now, this isn't *usually* a problem but I sorta frown upon it. I mean, I don't mind if you try the grapes (or any loose stock as long as it's not an apple or watermelon or something. Small loose stuff like grapes, cherries, [lychees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee) etc) but it would be polite if people would ask us first.

So this particular woman was trying the grapes... but she wasn't just trying one. She had a whole handful. An entire stem, in fact. About [this](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/natika/natika1106/natika110600341/9647817-perfect-bunch-of-red-grapes-isolated-on-white-background.jpg) many. As she was doing her shopping in the department, she had them in her hand by her side and would raise her hand to take one. Basically, she was trying to conceal the fact she had a handful. She happened to walk passed me as I was filling the tomatoes. We shall call her ""Grape Lady"".

**Me:** How do they taste?

*Stunned look from Grape Lady*

*Realizes I have seen her trying a handful of grapes*

**GL:** Oh... they are ok.

**Me:** Cool. In future, would it be ok if you want to try something to please ask and we are more than happy to let you sample the product.

**GL:** I'm just trying them!!!!

**Me:** I understand. Normally we wouldn't say anything if you were just trying one, but, you have a whole handful ...

**GL:** Oh well fine then!!

*drops the remaining grapes into my tomato crate on my flat deck*

*walks off*

I think she was a little embarrassed she was 'caught' and didn't like the idea I challenged her. Like I said, I'm happy for people to try ONE grape, but not a handful.

So I continue with my flat deck and finish up with it. I wheel it back into the back of the department and inform the others I'm going to take my break. It was lunch time so I went to the front of the store (checkouts) to grab a sandwich and a drink. It was rather busy so there were a lot of people around. As I was walking to the sandwich stand who should I see standing in line but Grape Lady. I didn't notice her at first as I was walking passed the que she was standing in heading for the sandwiches when she piped up and said to me;

**GL:** So what did you do to those grapes then?

*I stopped and turned around, saw it was Grape Lady and answered her question*

**Me:** Oh. Well, I had to dispose of them. I can't sell them unfortunately.

**GL:** Pfft. So what was the point of that then. You could have just let me have them and they wouldn't be wasted!

**Me:** Well like I said ma'am, You are welcome to try one but we can't let you have a whole handful!

**GL:** Why not?! If you're just going to waste them what's even the point?

**Me:** Because it's theft! That's why! One grape is theft but it's just one grape so we let it slide. A handful of grapes is a different matter. Please, ask us if you want to sample something and I'm happy to let you try one (or two). Not a handful.

*Grape Lady proceeds to place her basket of items on the ground and walk out of the store in utter disgust*

I watch as she walks away and heads for the exit. I then start to find myself a checkout so I can purchase my lunch. As I spot a small line in front of the VERY busy express lanes, Grape Lady turns around, and yells;

**GL:** I'M GOING TO LAY AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU!!! YOU DO **NOT** TALK TO CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!

Right then, EVERYONE stops and stares at me. Customers in line, checkout staff, the MANAGER (who was at checkouts helping with the rush at the time)... everyone! I knew if I walked away from this, every single person that heard her say that to me would instantly assume I was the rudest jerk in the store (good ol' public opinion, aye?). I don't know what came over me but I spoke up and came out with this;

**Me:** Really... and what are you gonna say? ""Oh, the man that caught me shop lifting was rude to me"". Yeah, that's gonna look really good, isn't it. In fact, the manager is standing RIGHT THERE (pointing to him). Why don't you tell him?!

You could hear a pin drop. Everyone then looked at her. Her jaw dropped, her face went red, I then saw what looked like tears (probably out of pure frustration). She then left the store.

I heard one lady in line say to me ""Good on you."" and a group of students in the express lanes went ""awwwwkward...."" in her direction. It was awesome!

Once I purchased my lunch, the managed asked if he could see me. Went to his office, told him exactly what I just wrote on here and he said ""ahh, ok... well, I can't really say anything other than don't talk to customers in front of everyone like that but I know how it would have looked on you if you didn't. So, well done.""

My heart was racing for a good 10min after that. I never saw her again.

*hmm, I wonder if she browses Reddit*

**tl;dr** Caught someone eating a large quantity of grapes. She didn't like me informing her that it's ok to try one but not a handful. She threatened to lay a complaint and I told her she was shoplifting. So go ahead!

gingerlover08,55,,89,19jk53,,521,"I work at a particular fast food restaurant that sells chili. You know the one with the soulless ginger for a mascot. 

Today I was the sandwich maker and although it's not my job, when I saw a man walk to the end of the counter with his chili cup, I stopped what I was doing to help him. In broken English he say ""More beans"". Ummm... what? ""I want more beans!"" 

So I figure out he wants another chili and for some reason has brought me back the cup. So I tell the cashier to ring him up for another one. He proceeds to start waving his arms and saying NO NO NO NO NO!!! MORE BEANS!!! I calmly explain that we do not do refills on chili and that if he would like another one it will be more money. He simply refuses to accept this. I then go get the manager who speaks the most Spanish to explain it to the man. 

After about 3 sentences of Spanish the customer looks up and says ""SPEAK FUCKING ENGLISH ASSHOLE!!!"" Oh my bad guy with a thick accent. I just assumed you didn't know how to speak English because you pretended not to understand the entire fucking conversation we JUST had. 

He then tells me and the manager in English that he just wants a refill on his chili because it was not enough. We again explain that he has to purchase another one. He slams his fist on the counter and proclaims to the entire restaurant that we are terrible, unhealthy, unsanitary, assholes who don't take care of customers and that he will never be returning.

WinnifredBurkle,77,,100,17fp9t,,522,"Whoops! I accidentally deleted my somewhat popular complainer mom and crazy yelling husband story. Thanks, though, to all who read/upvoted/commented. I enjoyed it!

So to make it up to you for deleting that post, here is a new crazy person story. Again, this took place at the pizza place/arcade/maze area chain that I worked at through high school and college. 

Anybody who is familiar with the place knows about exchanging tickets for prizes. You may also be aware of how most places have what's called a ticket bank, where kids can save up their winnings towards the giant stuffed toys or the cheapy skateboards or whatever. We just kept a piece of card stock with the kids name, birthday, and ticket total in this filing cabinet. Nothing super fancy. 

So one day this mom comes in with a pretty small kid. He was about two or so and was mostly interested in playing in the kiddie area, but she was adamant that he come play games with her. She spent *hours* playing this game called ""Wheel 'Em In"" where you try to get your token to land squarely on a number of lanes worth different amounts of tickets. (I don't know how to embed links, but if you google it you'll see what I mean.)

Anyway, she comes up to the counter close to closing. We're helping a few straggling customers so she has to wait, and I suggest she use the self ticket counter to get her ticket total. She says no, she doesn't trust that we didn't fix the machine to only count every second or third ticket. She wants me to count this huge pile of tickets by hand. I explain that that would probably result in more error as its really easy to lose your place, but she insists. I end up ripping all the tickets apart, so that its a huge pile of unattached tickets, and she has a total of around 500. 

Now, 500 tickets can buy you a lot. What it *cannot* buy, however, is a moderately sized stuffed version of our mascot. Those were around 1000, and this lady simply did not have enough. That didn't stop her from pointing at it and telling me that it was what she wanted. 

""I'm sorry ma'am, you don't have enough for that. Down in this case over here are the 500 ticket and under items.""

""No, I want that stuffed animal. I have enough.""

""No ma'am, I'm sorry. Those are 1000 tickets. You have 500.""

So we argue for a little while, then finally she seems to understand. She looks at the 500 and under sections, her little boy points at a few things he really seems to want, but she doesn't decide on anything. At this point we're past our closing time, everyone else is doing what closing duties they can, and I'm stuck with this lady. 

Finally I say that I can put her tickets in a bank if she can't decide on a prize. She looks at me like I told her to shove her tickets up my ass for safekeeping. 

""Absolutely not! I don't trust you guys and those ticket banks! You probably steal from them!"" I give her a look, like 'what the hell do you think I'm going to use your tickets to steal from this place?' But instead I just smile and offer her a bag so she can take her tickets home. 

""NO. I want that stuffed animal. I'll just pay you the left over with cash.""

Now, I don't know if y'all are aware, but we can't do that. There's no ticket-to-dollar ratio, and we didn't have a code or anything to put into the register to show that we sold a ticket item for cash. And besides, if that was allowed, we would run out of our bigger prizes really quickly, and have to spend more money to get more.  

""I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm not allowed to take cash for prize items. I'd be happy to set you up a bank and you're more than welcome to take a picture so you know the total stays the same.""

Logic does not work on her. She goes on a tirade about how ""fucking stupid"" it is that she can't purchase an item with cash, especially when it was ""fucking obvious"" that her son wanted the stuffed animal ""way bad.""  Her son had been slumped against a wall, exhausted, with a finger up his nose for about twenty minutes. He didn't give a damn about the toy. 

Mom continued to argue, I continued to tell her I just couldn't do it (it would have cost me my job, which I tried to explain) and we went on and on. 

Finally, in a complete rage, she just screamed a nonsense scream at me and pushed *five hundred individual tickets* off the counter. Those bitches went *everywhere*. She lets me know that she is never EVER coming back, and I say ""Have a nice night!""

We split the tickets and ate a shit ton of candy. It was awesome. 

And there you go! Hope this makes up for deleting my other post-I'm sorry!! I'll keep posting about crazy ticket people and psycho party moms and crazy poop stories if you guys like. Just let me know!

zero_hunter,41,,85,1eakwt,,510,"Hello TFR! After lurking for a while I decided to share one of my stories as a delivery driver. One of the stories posted recently reminded me of this, so I thought I'd share.

As I said before, I used to be a delivery driver for a deli in my town. When I wasn't driving, I would occasionally work cashier, answer phones, etc. I was working the night shift as a cashier on this particular day, and everything was going pretty normally so far.

The phone rings, I answer it, and a woman greets me on the other line.


Her: ""Hi, I was in earlier, and I think I lost my purse there by accident.""  
Me: ""Not a problem, ma'am. Let me check to see if anything got turned in.""


I put her on hold and ran to the back where our office was. I asked my manager on duty if a purse had been turned in, but he said nothing has turned up. I go around and ask my coworkers if they've seen it, and they tell me the same thing.

I pick up the phone again to speak with the lady.


Me: ""Sorry ma'am, but it looks like nothing's turned up. Where were you guys sitting at?""  
Her: ""Well, we were sitting at a booth, kind of on the end...""


I tell her that I'll take a look around and get her phone number in case someone finds it.

And so the hunt began! I start looking around where she was talking about and, oh? What's this? a purse! I rush back and gave her a call and told her I found it right where she said it was. She was ecstatic, and that she'd be there shortly. 

A short time later, I was helping other people when I noticed my coworker talking to a lady and hand her the purse. I walked up to let her know where I found it and to confirm that it was her's.

Her: ""Oh, you're the one who I spoke to on the phone? And you found my purse?""  
Me: ""Yes ma'am, that was me!""

She starts to dig in her purse while saying, ""You know, it would have been such a hassle to get everything back that I could have lost..."" She proceeds to pull out two bills. ""...so here, take this.""

I politely decline but she insists. I take the money and she thanks me profusely as she walks out. I noticed fives on the bills so I'm like, hey, ten bucks? Not too shabby. I take a closer look at the bills while I pull out my wallet and...

Those weren't two fives. Those were two FIFTIES. 

This lady gave me a hundred dollars just for finding her purse. It must have meant nothing to her compared to what she would have gone through if she had lost her purse, but to a broke kid in his early 20's? I was pretty stoked.

So I left my shift that night $100 richer and with a few jealous remarks from my coworkers. I really wish I could have thanked that lady more had I known. She seriously made my night, and I keep that memory as a reminder that not all customers are bad.

So a few days back I went back to get some groceries and told a friend of mine (also a co-worker) what happened. She looked at me in disbelief and told me that I was supposed to get a going-away present and money for my locker key. Oh, okay. Maybe they forgot..

I was at the local small grocery store for one item. I bought said item and got back in the car. As I was preparing to leave, I see a woman push her empty cart near the sidewalk. The cart corrale was just as far away as the sidewalk, but for some reason this lady thought the sidewalk was the proper place for the cart. Since it was on a slight hill, and a mighty winter wind was blowing, the cart began to roll into the street. The lady watched it roll a few feet and then turned and walked back to her car.

I'm pretty interested at this point. Will the cart roll into the street? Will a car hit it? Will it hit a car? Will the lady chase after it?

Yes.

No.

No.

No.

So I watch two cars narrowly miss the rolling cart as it rolls across the entrence to the parking lot, across the street, and up on to the opposite curb half a block away. All the while the lady sits in her car.

Since she was just sitting there, and I wasn't in a hurry, I jogged up the street, and pushed the cart back into the lot.  I parked the cart (sideways so it wouldn't roll) about 2 inches from the lady's back bumper just as her reverse lights came on.

She rolled down her window to bitch but before she could open her stupid mouth I said, ""That was yours. It seems like it got away from you. I brought it back. You're welcome."" And a trotted off to my car.

Drunken_Black_Belt,79,,132,16pkwo,,512,"Hello all. I figure I'd share a story before heading away for a week or two.  I've told it on here before, but in comments, so I'll tell it here.

**Mighty Mouse Saves the Day: Or Why I Quit Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch**

So obviously this was during my time with *Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch*.  I was already growing sick and tired with the company, their policies, and the employees.  

Anyways, as I'm sure most of you are aware, D&amp;B hires based off looks.  They get around HR issues by saying that they want to hire people who ""represent their brands"" and are ""outgoing, fun, and enjoyable to be around"".  But basically what they mean is young and extremely attractive.  And if you're a minority to boot? Fucking racial lottery jackpot as far as the company is concerned.  Here is a typical managers meeting summed up for any of their stores:

Manager 1: Guys we had to fire [insert names here] this week.  So this means we are low on African Americans.  

Manager 2: Me and Manager 3 went recruiting to [local event or popular hang out] and found X amount of candidates. 3 of them were African American and I got one Indian girl.

Manager 1: Great. Make sure you follow up with them so we can get them hired it'll look good with our numbers.

Now this may seem like an exaggeration but believe me its not.  It's bad enough to see people hired based off looks, but given jobs, especially managerial jobs just because of race is another issue. More often than not, the less attractive people were put into the back as ""Impact Team"". Basically stock.  Not that these people were usually ugly by any means. Just not ""Front Room Model material"".

Now I know some of you may be saying ""What does it matter? As long as they are hard workers?""  And you're right.  But a lot of times, the models in the front room knew why they were hired, and wouldn't care. They were there to get paid and hang out.  Some shined and really cared about their job, and were great with customers. Others just wanted to get paid and do as little work as possible. You'll find that in any job, but its exacerbated when the little shits know they were hired because they are attractive. 

To make things worse, it often left the Impact Team feeling like second class citizens.  And a lot of times they were.  They were usually left alone till something was needed or went wrong, and thats when they had attention paid on them.  This lead to a lot of issues with LP.  I can't tell you how many interviews I had with someone I caught stealing where they basically said they only did it because the company doesn't care about them.  It wasn't a good business model as far as I'm concerned. Then again what does that say about my looks if I was hired because I'm supposed to NOT look like I work there? =/

Anyways, I only added in that bit of background because it pertains to today's tale.  I had been having issues with this company, my managers, and how they handled their shrink, but this is why I ended up leaving the company.

It was Saturday. Saturdays at this mall, were busy.  And I don't mean typical mall busy. I mean busier than a all you can eat buffet with only one cook after Honey Boo Boo's family walks in.  I was bouncing around between stores, typical observation spots, and talking with other LP agents at other stores. It had been slow on the LP end. A sensor from a shirt found in the fitting room. A bracelet tag found stuffed into the pants of some jeans. Nothing huge. Nothing worth worrying about missing.  That's why I got the call from my *Follistar* store.  A manager there called and told me three hispanic guys had walked in, opened a bag, and swiped an entire table of colognes and bolted out. I told her to call the police and get the tape pulled, and to call two of the other stores. I was going to go to the *Dudercrombie and Bitch* main store and wait.  

 Luck was on my side when I walked in and saw the display in the front room was still up.  Directly to the right of the door was a table full of polos, and about 10 ft behind that were 3 tables, one of which had some shirts and a cologne display.  As I walked in, two hispanic guys, matching the description my manager had given me, brushed passed me and walked over to the colognes.  So I stay at the table with the polos, and waved over the girl greeting in the front room. She was new, I hadn't met her before, but I figured she could follow simple instructions.  I made to act like I was asking her a question about the polo shirt I was holding, but whispered to her to ""Run, and go get the manager. Tell her to call the cops here now!""

The girl just stared at me like I had told her I do the Macarena with no pants on as a tribute to my fallen gang members.  I was trying to discreetly instruct her while watching these two asshats.  I told her again to go grab [Manager's name] and call the cops now. As I was talked to her, I saw one of the guys pull out a booster bag from underneath his coat. A booster bag is basically a bag that is designed to defeat store alarms. I see Guy 1 open up the bag, and Guy 2 just swipes all the colognes inside.  Then for good measure he takes every shirt on the table, and swipes them in too.  Guy 1 then proceeds to walk toward the exit.

I hissed that the girl, who was still standing next to me ""Go get her NOW!""  and moved in the way of Guy 1.  Guy 2 sees me go to block his buddies path, and books it.  Fuck it, I want the guy with the merchandise.  Guy 1 stops for a second, looks at me, then the bag in his hand.

Now when you make a LP stop, you're supposed to identify yourself as working for the company, and ask them to come along with you. You're often encouraged to refrain from discussing the theft in public. Telling them you'll talk about it back in your office.  What I tried to say in this case was:

Me: Hi. My name is Drunken_Black_Belt.  I work for *B&amp;D* Loss Prevention and I'm going to need you to come with me.

What happened in this case was this:

Me: Hi, my name is Drunke

and then Guy 1 swung the entire bag at my face.

Nope. NOPE! FUCK THAT.  In the words of Ghandi "" IT'S GO TIME BITCH! DIPLOMACY OVER!""  

So guy swing bag at head and tries to run past me. I grab bag, grab guy with other hand.  Now I'm 6'4 and at the time 220.  This guy turned out to be 5'5 and 260.  So he's trying to kick me in the shins with his short stubby legs. I'm trying to stand back from being kicked with each hand of mine grabbing one of his wrist.  I'm sure it looked like a really awkward middle school slow dance, just angrier. The girl in the front room sees all this, and FINALLY runs off.  Good, she finally understands who I am.  Or so I thought.  I throw Guy to the ground.  I'm attempting to put him on his back, when some ass hat come running up and leading with his shoulder, drives right into me.  As he did so, he yells ""GET OFF HIM HE'S DOING HIS JOB"".  Thank god that Guy 1 is a fat out of shape fucker, cuz he's on the ground winded from our 20 second episode.  I throw the guy who just tackled me, off of me, and yell ""I'm the LP asshole.  I'm on my back at this point, and Guy 1 start to get up and try to run. Before he can eve take his second step I just kick out with my leg and catch his knee, and Guy 1 goes down like a lesbian at a sleep over after a pillow fight.  The guy who tackled me is trying to apologize while I'm trying to get on top of Guy 1 again.  Guy 1 is on his back kicking at me, and I have his ankles trying to just wait to move them aside and get an arm secured.  Meanwhile, Douchbag McShoulders over here is waving in my face to get my attention because he wants me to know that he's REALLY sorry and feels bad he didn't know I wasn't the thief.  Theres a huge crowd around us, as this store was right by an entrance. Suddenly the crowds part, and I just hear "" OUT OF MY WAY! IM A MARRRIIIIIIINNNNEEEE!!!!!!!"" as some guy comes outta knowhere, jumps on top of Guy 1, and grabs his arms. I tell Shoulders to get the fuck away from me, (in the nicest way possible of course) and he melts into the crowd.  Mighty Mouse, the guy who jumped in, says he's a Marine MP, and helps me secure Guy 1.  Eventually Mall security meanders over, and I ask for their cuffs. But they can't give them too me. So I ask them to cuff him. Nope. They can't touch him unless he touches them first.  I glare at him and debate letting Guy 1 up just so he can give this asshole a hard time, but decided against it. At this point Guy 1's shirt is gone, he's sweating profusely and I am covered in it. Gross.

Anyways, we sit there for 5 minutes.  Eventually I ask the mall security if he can call the cops.  They show up 2 minutes later, cuff Guy 1, and we go back to the office.  They never got a call before. I walk in the back, and the girl I had been instructing is sitting with my manager. I ask what the hell they are doing. Manager says this girls trying to tell me something but that the girl doesn't speak english so manager doesn't know what.

Yup. Girl was hired, her first week in America, because she's cute and black.  Didn't speak any English. Not that that should exclude her from working, but maybe not in a job where you talk with customers, and stop shoplifters all day.   Processed Guy 1. Had just over $5500 worth of shit in the bag.  Got him for Assault, and Possession of a Shoplifting tool too. Had a talk with Manager and she  decided maybe this girl wasn't ready for the front room (good fucking call).  And the best part?  Mighty Mouse had been at the jewlery store next to B&amp;D buying an engagement ring. I went over to thank him, and the workers who knew me there (they allowed me watch my store from their store) gave him a 30% discount for helping out.

thelightscallmehome,42,,111,1a0ee1,,512,"As I mentioned in my last post, I'm a cashier. However, at the store I work at*, I am also employed in the babysitting-type area we have at the front end. I love working there, as it is easily a thousand times better to color, watch TV, and read with young kids than it is to check-out customers for eight hours or work at self checkout for five.

At the children's area, we have a security procedure that allows us to make absolute sure that the child (or children) are in the right adult's hands, and that all children are signed out properly. This takes a few minutes, and afterwards there's enough time for me to wave goodbye to the kid(s). 

One little girl in particular, who had been the absolute sweetest throughout the hour she was there, stopped suddenly as she was leaving with her mom. She looks at me, then her mom and asks, ""Is that a boy or girl?"" 

I'm pretty used to people wondering my gender, as I have fairly shorter hair than the average girl, and am not exactly what you'd call ""pretty"". Most people my age ask me this out of sheer horribleness, but with my experience with kids, I knew that she was only curious, and meant absolutely no harm. 

As with any younger kid who asks me this, I smile politely and reply that I am, in fact, a girl. She looks at her mom again, then  back at me, then her mom. She takes a second before responding, ""I want to look just like her."" My heart absolutely melted. No one has said anything so kind about my appearance ever, and it put me in an incredibly good mood. I'm actually getting somewhat teary eyed thinking about this.

oh_papillon,82,,144,1qopj8,,511,"Dear customers,

I'm going to have to ask you to please stop turning every problem you have in our store into a race issue. In case you haven't noticed, we live in a very culturally diverse area where it's pretty much impossible not to come across people of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The same is true of our store. Now, as I'm sure you noticed when you came to shop here, people of many different races and nationalities both shop here and work here. Whatever race you are, we probably have at least one person on staff who is the same race as you, probably more. We value all people and strive to treat everyone the same when upholding store policies and resolving issues.

Sir, I am sorry we sold you a defective phone. I get that it sucks when you're expecting a new piece of technology to work and then you take it home and it doesn't. And while you can bring it back and exchange it for another one, I get that it can be a huge hassle for you. But when you insinuate that we sold you a defective phone because you are [race], you are implying that the lovely people in our mobile department A) knew the phone was defective (they didn't), and B) knowingly sold you a defective phone after C) squirreling it away upon finding out it was defective, until someone of your particular race (that's you, you lucky bastard) tried to buy that particular model. Do you realize how ridiculous that is?

Look, we are a store. We like money. We're one of the larger retail corporations out there. We REALLY like money. Even yours. We would never ever purposefully do something that would cause you not to spend money in our store just because your skin is a certain color. We're too greedy!

So the next time we tell you that we can't give you the full price of the item you're returning back in cash, it's not because you're white/black/Hispanic/Asian/Arab/whatever. It's because you don't have a receipt, and them's the rules. For you, and for everyone. ","On the ""race card""",655,talesFromRetail
JacOfAllTrades,141,,150,19fcoo,,514,"This was originally a comment, that, upon request, I made into a post.

At the time, this totally blew my mind and it still does to this day. As of Veteran's Day 2011, our company started offering military discounts (I should say that we officially started offering them, for if someone asked for one, we'd just give them a 10% discount using a different code), and as such, we started getting a lot more military in the store. Well, that means we get disabled vets who get military discount and tax exempt, so they save 10% and no tax. 

I had an older couple do this, and the woman behind them lost her fucking mind. She just started screaming, ""So they get 20% off because why? For nothing! What'd you do that was so special!? Not a damn thing! I'm a teacher and I don't get shit! Fuck you!""

Here's some things to note before I say the response: 1) this guy clearly had a prosthetic leg (the metal pole kind), massive facial scars, and three missing fingers; 2) to do a tax exempt sale we have to enter information into the computer then make a physical copy of the document, which takes time and is obvious; 3) to get a military discount, I take the ID and hold it up to match the picture, so again, obvious; 4) I will try to give you a discount if you're polite regardless; and finally, 5) no way in hell a teacher can afford to ~~shop at~~ buy what she was buying at my store unless there is some other source of income, so she's clearly either full of shit or reliant on someone else.

The response: ""Ma'am, without this man's service, you wouldn't be able to say things like that without being shot where you stand."" The vet just shook his head, but his wife laughed. 

The lovely and eloquent teacher put her stuff on the counter and demanded a discount, and when I told her no she demanded a manager... Who also refused the discount, and once she was told the whole story, told the woman not to come back until she learns some respect.

flarpy59,31,,112,1oz9nd,,518,"This previous summer I started a new job as an ice cream man. My job consisted of driving my converted school bus around town and peddling my wares to anyone who would buy. One of my favorite areas to drive through was this dingy little back road that housed some of the strangest people I ever interacted with. 

The first odd experience happened right around my second week on the job. By this time I had become pretty familiar with my route and was now focused on building relationships with my customers. I remember encountering this one kid who shall be referred to as ""Kingpin"" in this story. Now, Kingpin was this adorably small blonde haired boy who was probably around 8 years old. The couple of previous times he had bought from me I could barely hear him order, so I naturally assumed he was just a meek mannered boy. This day, however, turned out to be quite different. As I pulled up to Kingpin's house, I could see 3 older kids wrestling in the front yard. The all had Kingpin's blonde hair, but were much larger and seemingly more aggressive than him. So, Kingpin comes strolling out of the house, bypasses the violent tussle in the yard, and comes straight up to my truck. 

""Are those your brothers?"" I asked (attempting to foster some relationships and all that jazz). 

""Yep. Three ice cream sandwiches,"" he replied, without giving a glance to the MMA exhibition happening behind him.

I figured he was just being a nice brother and buying ice cream for his siblings, but I was surprised when he unwrapped one of the sandwiches and began eating it feverishly. Now, my boss trusted me to give out ice cream when it would help build a relationship with a customer, so I figured that Kingpin just didn't have enough money to buy one for all three. As he began to walk away I called out to him.

""Hey! Take an extra one so all your brothers can have one,"" I said, feeling confident that I was doing my good deed for the day.

Imagine my surprise when Kingpin unwrapped a second ice cream sandwich and began to demolish it despite the fact that he hadn't finished the previous one! 

""No, I got one for them,"" which was spoken with the biggest smirk on his face. Then, he leaned in close to me, and delivered the line that quickly cemented his place in my ""Hall of Favorite Customers. ""

MackaySmith,128,,114,1metwl,,511,"To start things off, I want to give a little back story. I work at an office/electronics store. A couple weeks ago, a 20-something year old girl comes in with her friend. I've worked years in retail, so I honestly don't profile based on color, but there are some things that put up an instant red flag. This girl and her friend both reeked of marijuana. They looked around for a bit, asked about some tablets, and then decided to buy a bunch of gift cards. $500 worth. I didn't notice, because once they were done asking about the tablets, I walked away and they dealt with the cashier. Their cards didn't swipe, but their IDs checked out so she punched in the numbers and it worked. She realized later that it was a scam and told the manager. 

Anyways, after all this happened, about two nights ago, another girl, dressed similarly to the other two walks in. No big deal, lots of people dress that way. I noticed her looking at my shirt a bunch, then avoiding me.(I am not a manager, but I have a different shirt color than most other employees. She must have thought me a manager.) Next thing I know, one of the cashiers asks me to help her buy a laptop. So I ask her which one she would like, and she tells me, ""I want this laptop, and these two tablets!""

Red flag.

I have to get a manager to let me into the back to get the things she requested. While we are there, I tell my manager, ""Mike, this lady just asked for an expensive laptop and two tablets like it was nothing. She didn't ask anything about them."" He responds, ""You think somethings up?"" ""Definitely."" 

We go back outside and I bring the items up to the cashier. The girl brings up about $1,200 worth of gift cards she wants to buy. My manager and I stand close by, watching over the new cashier. 

When it's almost finished and we require payment, wouldn't you know it, her card isn't recognized by our machine. She swipes again. Doesn't work. Again, and again. My manager checks her ID and it seems to be correct! But because we know this is fraud, we tell her to contact her bank and that we can't sell her anything. She leaves, and my manager goes and emails all our other stores in the city, warning them about this girl. He then calls our store manager who was, at the time, helping another store. He explains what just happened, and we get praised for catching her. 

Once they are off the phone, the girl walks into the other store. Now, my store manager LOVES catching people stealing. He lets her go and pick out all the things she wants and then bring it up to the register. Before even ringing up her items though, he says, ""Hmmm, they couldn't help you at the other store?"" Her eyes widened. ""They called you??"" to which my manager responds, ""What? Nope."" She immediately walks away and flips off my store manager on the way out. It felt so good stopping her.

Another day, another 20,000 gallons of fuel to sell.  Let it be known to all and sundry that, despite the events that I have told here, most of my days at the station were, in fact, rather dull.  Car comes in, say hi, take money, pump gas, hand back receipt, say bye.  Over and over and over again, ad infinitum.  It was a job that allowed one to either A) turn your brain off and not think, or B) let your mind wander and think about awesome creative stuff like unicorn hair care products or specialty underwear for overweight leprechauns.  Or maybe the gas fumes were getting to me.

It was also in a rather rich neighborhood.  Rare, exotic, or otherwise extremely expensive cars were a common occurrence.  Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Maseratis, Bentleys, Rolls Royces, Aston Martins, etc.  So when a very nice Porsche Carrera GT3 rolled into the station, I was not overly amazed.  I walked over and greeted the driver, as I always do, with a cheery smile.  He stepped out of the vehicle, handed me a card, and asked me to fill up with supreme.  No problem.  He then stepped over into the parking lot, and lit up a cigarette (far enough away that I didn't have to yell at him).

It wasn't busy at that moment, so I stuck by the car as it slowly filled, and my eyes wandered over to the driver.  He was dressed nicely, a suit that I could tell was probably worth more than all my guitars put together.  Hair slicked back.  Shoes probably worth more than my shitty car.  And a crack pipe in his hand.

Double take.

Was I seeing that right?  I looked closer, and yeah, there in his off hand, a small glass pipe, with charring on one end and what looked like cotton in the other.  Huhn, never seen one of those outside of class.  I walked over to my assistant manager (who was part of the same criminal justice college classes I was) and surreptitiously told him about it.  He walked over, doing his best to look inconspicuous, and had a gander himself.  Yup, sure looks like a crack pipe.  Weird.

We had a quick debate as to whether we should call the police, but were leaning towards not.  We weren't 100% certain, though it really looked like one.  And it's JUST the pipe, he's not smoking it nor does he have any baggies of something yellowish and clumpy.  Probably should just let this one go.

But our minds got made up for us when a State Trooper pulls in.  Complete coincidence, the trooper needs gas.  Okay, since he's already here...I go over, do the greeting again.  ""By the way, sir, I'm not 100% certain of this, but it really looks like the guy over on pump 12 has a crack pipe in his hand.  Could you go take a look?""

It's a young cop.  Maybe 25.  And he gets that ""Oh ho, I have just stumbled upon criminal activity, I shall investigate forthwith!"" look on his face that gung-ho new cops can get, and steps out of his vehicle.  The driver of the Porsche has now walked back over to his car, as the pump has clicked off, and he's waiting to be disconnected so he can leave.  I don't know if he even saw the cop.

What I do know is that, when the cop walked around the pillar that holds up our awning, he didn't even get a single word out of his mouth.  Because the Porsche driver immediately swung on him.  BAD IDEA.  The cop was freshly off FTEP, all that hand-to-hand training he got in academy fresh in his mind.  That one swing was all the suspect got, because he was immediately dumped on the ground and pinned down, while the cop yelled into his radio for back up.  My manager and I stood in shock, jaws somewhere down around our kneecaps.

What had been just one State Trooper getting gas was now one State Trooper conducting an arrest, with two local cops, a county sheriff, and a State Trooper supervisor observing and acting as backup.  My manager, another attendant who hadn't been involved at all up to this point, and myself figured it would be a good idea to back off and let the cops do their thing.  Customers weren't going to be pulling up anyway, not with a bunch of red and blue lights flashing everywhere.  I also suggested making popcorn, but got vetoed.  Always gotta ruin the fun.

So the suspect is now being interviewed, and a search of his car is being conducted.  Suddenly, everything just seems to stop, and the cop who was hip-deep in the car slowly backs out with a very large bag.  Think a quart freezer bag that's been filled with air so it's the shape of a pillow.  And inside is a black, semi-liquid substance.  Ya know, kinda looks like heroin.  Someone grab a test kit.

Yup.  Heroin.  Two and a half pounds of it.

Now several more units show up, all of them saying ""supervisor"" or ""lieutenant"" on the doors.  The suspect is no longer being an idiot and trying to swing at anyone, but he is VERY vocal about how he needs to be released.  He has a job interview to get to, and he REALLY needs to go.  Over and over and over again, like a broken record of the album *Interview Nervousness* by the band Career Hunter.  Sorry bro, that's really not going to get you out of this one.  He was arrested, the car was towed away, and we basically didn't do any business for about 30 minutes.  And I never got any popcorn.

This meant that we had a mix of income levels in our store, but the worst were the ones from the rich town.

So this night had been a pretty good one up until this point. Most of my guests had small purchases and it wasn't too busy, so I engaged in some small talk with many of them, talking about how I was leaving for university soon and them wishing me good luck. Everything was going smoothly. 

Right then, Charmander (I'll call her this due to her ""fiery"" personality) walked up to my register with an obscene amount of clothing, which is strange because usually pokemon don't wear clothes, but I ring up her up.. I look at the clothes, give an internal sigh, and go to work taking the clothing off the hangers, folding them up, and bagging them nicely for her. Also, I should mention that she is staring down my computer the whole time like a falcon about to go in for the kill, making sure that every single item is priced correctly.

Apparently, one of the items had rung up incorrectly and she told me that it was supposed to be $35. I looked at the price, which happened to be around $80 (this was a very nice dress), and thought there was no way it was $35. I politely told her I would call someone in softlines and they could check for us. This set off Charmander, and she evolved straight into a Charmeleon right in front of my eyes.

Charmeleon claimed that she also worked retail and she knew that I could manually change the price. This was true, but I could only do it in situations where the price was under $20 and the price quoted to me looked to be about right. She also claimed that the customer is always right, so I shouldn't be wasting her time checking the price. 

I got a call back from the department the dress was from and they told me that it was in fact $80. I thanked them and repeated this to Charmeleon hoping that this would end the argument. Not even close. Now she is a full-fledged Charizard, breathing flames into my face. She yells at me with, ""I work in retail and I KNOW that you can changed the price!!! I told you that the price was $35 so you so change it for me!!! You are so imcompetent!

All of a sudden, a Blastoise and her trainer appeared to put out the flames! This Blastoise attacks Charizard with a Hydro Cannon by saying, ""If you actually worked retail, you wouldn't be yelling at this cashier right now! He's just doing his job, so when he tells you he can't change the price, that means he can't! So either you can pay for your stuff and fuck off, or we can meet outside and I can fuck you up! Your choice.""

At this, our Charizard has quieted down, and has decided to pay for her items and leave the store without another word. As she leaves, the trainer yells out at the top of her lungs, ""Have a good day motherfucker!"", which causes Charizard to fly out of the store as fast as possible. All I could do after this exchange was laugh and thank her over and over again. I also gave them some discounts on a few of her items because they were so awesome. They told me that they both work retail to and hated seeing ""bitchy customers"" in other stores, so they always told them off. I couldn't stop smiling the rest of the night.

I was working at an upscale toy store, which was owned by my boss. It was December 21. The hot toy that year was Star Wars Lego sets. Everyone wanted one. 

A woman comes in near closing and demands a Star Wars Lego set. Not asks - demands. I explained to her that, unfortunately, we didn't have any left in stock, and, as you can probably imagine, she blew a gasket. She insisted that I get my boss, RIGHT NOW, because she WAS going to get that set before she left. I was 17 and terrified of all the customers who were like this.

So, I got my boss and brought her over. The lady explained that I was so incredibly unhelpful to her, and that I refused to sell her a Star Wars set. My boss listened patiently, and then said this:

""Okay. So, you came here to buy the most popular toy of the season four days before Christmas, and it's my employee's fault that you can't find it? Please get out of my store and don't return.""

She then smiled, turned around and led me in the other direction. Like a literal boss. ",Badass Boss,602,talesFromRetail

I work at a college bookstore the first couple of weeks of each semester. It can get pretty brutal. I'm the only employee there who goes to a different college, and since I start back to school about a week after my fellow employees, I'm usually free to be scheduled for the full twelve hour days, which is a killer. Plus, hell hath no fury like a student who can't find a specific textbook. 

So it's the first day of school, and we're swamped. The line for the cash registers stretches all the way out the door. Some of the customers are patient, but the vast majority are horrible. I've been cursed out, called an idiot, and someone went so far as to tell me I'll ""Never set foot in a classroom here again."" I decided against telling them I don't even go here. 

I'm working the register mid-morning when a young man finally gets called up. His arms are full of art supplies and textbooks, and I start ringing him up. He engages me in pleasant conversation and actually helps out by bagging his own books. After the transaction is complete, he tells me that there are some supplies he's in need of that aren't in stock. When this happens, we have to get a pre-order slip, go find the ISBN numbers of the required supplies, and fill out the pre-order form. 

As a cashier, I'm not required to do this; usually I just send the customer to one of my coworkers who manages the floor. However, I can see that all the floor workers are busy with customers, and the line for the cash registers has died down a slight bit, so I agree to help him out. He has a long list of things he needs, so I spend the next twenty minutes running down paint samples and canvas and filling out pre-order forms. By the time I'm done, the line has stretched out again. He thanks me politely and says that he's going to get back in line, making a lighthearted comment about hoping the professor for his next class won't be angry with him for being late on the first day. Instead of making him wait another half hour in line, I take him back to my register and get his supplies pre-ordered. He thanks me again and leaves. 

Three hours later, I clock out for lunch and head for the door. As I'm about to walk out, the guy comes back in. He tells me that he's got yet another bunch of supplies to preorder and asks if I wouldn't mind helping him. I'm taking off my apron as he's talking, and he realizes I'm off the clock. He apologizes and says he'll find someone else to help. I have to admit, when you come across a customer as nice as this one was, you tend to want to help them out. So, off the clock, I head back into the bookstore with him and help him gather the rest of his supplies. I tell him that since I'm clocked out, I won't be able to ring him up and that he'll have to wait in line. He understands, and thanks me again. 

I walk with him to the end of the line on my way out the door. Before I can leave, however, a lady approaches me with a basketful of textbooks and asks me to check her out. I apologize to her, telling her that I'm off the clock and unable to work a register. Her response? ""Then clock back in and check me out. It will only take a few minutes."" I explain to her that I won't be able to clock back in until one p.m., an hour after I clocked out. She immediately blows up on me, telling me that she watched me help the other customer find his things, and that I'm sexist. (I'm a girl.) I try to explain to her that I only helped the man find his supplies, and that I can't check out either of them. She retorts with, ""I'm not standing in this line. You're going to check me out or I'm going to talk to your manager."" Before I can tell her to be my guest, the young man I've been helping all day suddenly says, in a very hateful tone, ""Actually, I think I'm going to talk to the manager."" Without another word, he leaves the line and heads for the back office. The woman gives me a smug look. 

My feelings were hurt, but I know an escape when I see one. I left the store to go on lunch, but I felt awful, firmly believing that no good deed goes unpunished. I return to work at the end of the hour, clock in, and I'm immediately approached by the manager. He asks for my side of the story, and I tell him. He nods, satisfied, and then informs me that a gentleman had come back to the office to tell him that ""one of your best employees is being harassed, and damned if I'm going to watch it."" My manager went with him to see the disgruntled lady, listened to her rant, and told her that he was not going to reprimand me for doing my job.

His cut was done before mine and he got up to pay and she said $25.00, And he said, ""WHAT but I came here instead of going to the other place! and your menu says $18.00!""

Anyway, here's my story.  A very nice woman came in with her 15-16 year old son, and they were looking for a $600-1000 bike so the kid can race mountain bikes.  Not a big deal.  Anyway, I pull out a mid-range $700 bike that has notoriously touchy Shimano hydraulic disc brakes.  Remember this too.
So anyway, we get a helmet, and go out to the parking lot for a test ride.
That's when she drops the bomb on me.
""He's never ridden a bike with gears and brakes before!""
Great.  Not a huge deal, so I calmly explain how the gears work, how to pedal when shifting, and (since he's never used hand brakes before) a warning NEVER to touch the front brake.  ""It will send you right over the handlebars!""
So, off he rides.  He goes for about five minutes, all is well.  He's gone for another five minutes.  No big deal.
Then he came back.

""You hit the front brake, didn't you?""

They end up buying the bike, and some accessories.
As she goes to pay, I tell her the total.  It was around $900 with tax.  I notice her writing $1100 on the check.  Strange.
""You guys do tips?""
""Yes, we do!""

lurkernomore99,119,,112,1g4zxl,,502,"Inspired by another ""allergy"" post I saw today.

I was working at a hotel that was rather close to the airport. We had the contract to keep all pilots and flight attendants from a fairly well known airline every night. They came in at all times throughout the day and left at all times due to their scheduling. Overall, these were the rudest, pickiest, meanest people I had to deal with while at this five star hotel.

One night I received a call from a lady saying she was a pilot with that airline and she would be staying at my hotel next week. She said that she is allergic to the wifi signal and cannot stay on a floor with a wireless router. 

uhm...okay, I'll be sure to do that. 

**now it's time to check in**

All floors have wireless routers, because this is 2011? So I tell her I can't do that but I find out where the router is and put her in the room furthest from the router. She LOSES HER SHIT. ""This is so unsensitive! ""Would you cook my food in the fish pan if I were allergic to fish as well?"" ""Can't, you just disconnect the router for one night? What's the big deal?""

THEN!!!!! Her phone rings and she answers it, says ""I can't talk right now"" hangs up and turns back to me with the ""what are you going to do for me"" face. I clearly can't say anything about the WIRELESS PHONE CALL she just held up to her head because I'm in retail and therefore everyone's bitch. I tell her we'll unplug the one on her floor (obviously, we wouldn't) and she walks away without another word.



 It then occurs to me, after she calls that she's connected to wireless computer shit ALL DAY LONG in that cockpit?

dichill,56,,126,1ft8jr,,508,"So, I work in a major department store as a cashier. A few weeks after I was training with other cashiers my manager trusted that I knew my stuff and allowed me to start being alone for shifts. I still had some slip-ups, but nothing major or harmful to the company. My coworkers and managers are usually great when I ask for help.

Anyways, one of the first few shifts that I was working by myself, it was late afternoon and pretty slow. A tall, unshaven man about 30-40 years old walks up to me with a bag with a pair of dress pants. We'll refer to him as TUM (tall unshaven man, for lack of a better term).

**TUM:** I wanna return these pants.

**ME:** Alright. Was there anything wrong with them? Wrong size... changed your mind..?

**TUM**: ..yeah.

**ME**: Okay. Did you bring your receipt?

He didn't have his receipt, so I did the return using his telephone number (my company allows non-receipt returns). When I scanned the pants, the register that showed that he paid 49.99 and with tax about $53. I went all the way through the return and told him that his refund would be $53. He looks at me with the stare I think only Satan would be capable of.

**TUM:** I paid $100 for these pants. They are worth $100. Look, they're right over there. See? $100. Give me my full refund.

**ME** (after scanning the pants on a different register): Huh. They are $100. Let me try that again.

Now, at this point, I was completely unaware that this customer was trying to rob me. I thought that somehow the refund was wrong because the pants were a different price. I went through the transaction again and unsurprisingly still came up with a $53 refund. 

**ME:** Sorry, the register is telling me you paid $53 and that you will get that credited back to your card.

**TUM:** Look, I'm in a hurry. Just give me the $100 you owe me and there won't be a problem.

At this point, my heart is beating really fast. This guy is pretty intimidating and I, being a 16 year old girl, looked like a pretty easy target to him. I paged for my manager because I thought she would be able to diffuse the situation. 

My manager, we'll call her BAM (Badass Manager because, well, you'll see), comes in a few minutes and talks to the TUM. Keep in mind, my manager is a petite woman and about a foot shorter than the man. However, this customer is about to find out that she doesn't take shit from anyone.

**BAM:** Is there a problem, sir?

**TUM**: Your employee isn't giving me my refund. The pants are $100 she's only giving me half. I'm in a hurry. Are all your employees completely incompetent? 

**BAM: (a little shocked at this point)** Let me see your receipt... 

**BAM:** How could we give you a refund of $100 if this receipt says you only paid $50? It is irrelevant what the price is now. We do not honor current prices for returned items. What you paid is what you'll be getting back. 


**TUM**: What are you trying to say? 

**BAM:** There's nothing we can do.

They go back and forth like this for a while. Afterwords, the guy finally leaves with his $53 refund. 

**BAM**: You know that guy was trying to scam you, right?

**ME**: No.. I wasn't thinking straight. (dumb thing to say, I know)

**BAM**: Well, I'm proud of you dichill. You called me because you knew something was up. Whenever something like that happens, don't hesitate to call me or another manager.

Another coworker comes over and we tell her the story. She says that she saw the customer walk around to every department and stopped at mine. He is apparently notorious for finding the youngest/most naive looking employee and tries to get extra discounts/money off of them.

I dont know his name, but I know his car and his voice from a mile away. He always orders one thing: A Large Diet Coke. Everytime, without fail, he pulls up and I automatically ring it up for him. This is in drive through, just in case you're wondering. 

When I first started, I had no idea who he was. Just another face amongst the many faceless people I meet everyday. Until he kept coming back, all the time. After a while, we started smalltalk, and eventually became pretty good friends. How can I be friends with someone when I don't know their name? I have no idea, but he's the best person I've met in this line of work. Today he came through and changed it up. He ordered a yogurt parfait and then his usual Diet Coke. I said ""changing it up today, eh?"" and he just laughed and said ""I like to keep you on your toes."" He pulls up and asks me how I'm doing. My girlfriend has dumped me and my life is kind of a clusterfuck, so hearing him ask that just made me want to cry alittle. He was interested in how I was, because he knew something was wrong. He asked me how school was going and said ""Have a good night, bud!"" as he drove away.

Basically you order something, I'm the lucky guy that gets to find it in the store, put it on a pallet, and then shove it on a truck. So a customer went through management to place an order for about 250 linear feet of molding (they normally come in 15 foot lengths). Apparently after talking to this manager, she created the order and pulled it herself. But she didn't put the order to the dispatch, so our delivery trucks don't know they have an order to deliver. She didn't put a location as to where she left the order. And she didn't put a purple tag on it to say that it was for deliveries/will call.So going through the store picking the order, we are only able to get about half of the molding. Great. So I call the customer to see if they want to wait, or if we want to try to get it from another store. She assures me that we have enough, and to talk to my manager. So I dial 101, manager picks up and I explain the situation. She quickly snaps back at me that the order is by the managers office on a cart. This was surprising because when you complete an order, you put a tag on it, and you put it by the door that we load the trucks out of, not the managers office. So whatever, I go pick it up.Once there, she tells me that she told me about this yesterday and that I'm wasting time. I paused and reminded her that I don't work on Tuesdays, that you must have told someone else. She said that she knew she told me. So I go and print out my punch times for the last week, and none were made on Tuesday. I shove it on her desk, and kindly tell her to let us handle deliveries because it wastes her time. She looks a little embarrassed.So we get the order and are all set too put it on the truck. But the driver says that he doesn't have room for it and that its not in the dispatch route he has. Well fuck me. Nothing we can do about it, he's right. So we call the customer and inform them that we have the material, but that we can't deliver it today. Lady flips a shit and asks to speak with management.Couple minutes later, I get a call from this bitch of a manager. And she is screaming at me for not delivering it. Then I explained how it wasn't in the dispatch and the driver didn't have room, so he couldn't have taken it. Here comes the face palm moment. She asked what the dispatch is. Ohhhh boy. She had no clue that you need to let the fucking delivery truck service know that you have an order or orders to pick up! So I end up walking down to her office again to show her what she didn't do. And I told her that she can call the customer back and tell them why we can't deliver it.

Furfaidz,79,,134,1o7qhe,,500,"I work near a large tourist attraction in a big grocery story. We are all about customer service but I cannot begin to tell you the absolute lack of human sympathy tourists have for everyone here. There are many stories I can tell, but the one I think most related is the foreign costumer story, which happened about two months ago.

I'm called to the front over the intercom so I abandon my current job (blocking/shopping the story/returning go back items) to help at the registers. I see two registers open, one express and the other is a regular register. As you all know, the express lane is for people who want to get their stuff and go, so only 10 items or fewer are allowed in express at my store. Sometimes we let a bit more than 10 items but we make sure it's no more than 20. 

Well, as you can imagine the regular register has quite a line but express only has two customers with a handful of items. I notice an older gentleman pushing a cart full of items, items on top of items. He looks at the regular lane then at express, then he pushes his cart over to express and he waits for his turn. I walk up to him and I say, ""I'm sorry, sir, but this lane is only for people with ten items or fewer. You will have to wait in the regular lane until I can open a register.""

He shakes his head, acting dumbfounded, and replies, ""Que? No se..."" Blah blah blah, he starts talking in his own language, but I know he knows what I'm saying. I point to the brightly lit sign above the express lane that has the number 10 and in English ""items or fewer"". 

Just so you guys know, I speak only English but I know more Spanish than I do my native language (Turkish.) So I try to meet this guy in the middle. I count with my fingers to ten in Spanish and I show him the number with my fingers, say it in Spanish and I point to his items. 

Again, he acts like he has no idea what I'm talking about. 

I'm a patient person.

I smile and I pick up one of his items and I politely say, the best I can in his language ""Ten, no eleven, twelves, thirteen. Ten"" Then I point at a customer emptying his basket at express and I piping to that customers items and say ""ten"" in my poor Spanish. By the time I'm done explaining, the regular lane is shorter, and the Spanish gentleman replied, ""Oh! Gracias."" And I reply, ""Denada. Lo siento"" as he moves his cart to the regular lane. 

Once I'm done with him, I run over to register 8 and put my light on. I see the Spanish gentleman's son and wife meet up with him at the regular register with a few more items. 

I walk over to them and I point at my light and I say, ""Eight"" In English. The son looks up at register 8's light and turns to his dad and in perfect English he says, ""Dad, let's go to eight.""

Anyways, we had a big bunch of thunderstorms about a year or so ago. Tornadoes, heavy rain, it was kinda cold so the roads were slick, all that fun stuff. I wasn't actually worried because i was driving a 4x4 pickup. I was usually the guy they sent out when no one else would go because of conditions or due to that delivery being way out of the way or something.

Continuing on, we had those thunderstorms. My experience with any kind of rain having worked in both a grocery store and a pizza delivery place is such. When it rains, most people do one of the following. they will either freak out and go grocery shopping like its the end of the world, or they will freak out and stay home and order delivery pizza. I usually don't mind though. Hell it's good money! But this lady.....oh she takes the cake. 

We get an order on the screen, it gets made, and we go to put the delivery stickers and whatnot on the boxes. the delivery area is WAY out of the way. Doesn't bother me too much so i load everything up and throw my truck into 4 wheel drive and go on down the road. Still raining like a bitch, threat of tornadoes, threat of places flooding. my pickup could handle it though. so i trudge on up this lady's driveway. steep as fuck, wet, muddy, all the fun stuff. (another side story, my pickup had a flowmaster exhaust so when i started up this lady's driveway i saw her coming out of her house cause she heard it coming). finally get up to her house and start to get everything together and all that. still raining like crazy. run up to her house and get to where she was standing and we do the normal monetary exchange. then this happens....

They get over to the Lilly's and then the guy goes mental about how the same product shouldn't be different prices, my manager calmly explains that it's because the Lilly's he saw in clearance had already bloomed hence them being reduced.

suckmydikdik,84,,108,1i2gn1,,501,"Been lurking for a while, decided to finally tell some work stories. Not exactly retail, so forgive me, but I can definitely relate to a lot of things I read here.

I work at a zoo food stand. Other than our special plastic cups with their fancy, sturdy straws, there are no straws anywhere in the zoo. I've heard this is normal at many zoos in the country. We've personally been told this is for animal safety. (I'm not entirely sure this is the truth but considering the number of ducks and other birds flittering around picking at people's litter on the concrete, or with litter stuck to their feet, it's a perfectly plausible excuse.)

A lot of people ask us where we keep the straws, and when we tell them there are no disposable straws or lids for certain cups, for animal safety, they usually get it and walk away. We can't give them what we don't have, of course.

But some people just gotta have straws, apparently.

Had a customer order a beverage—in a cup that has no lid or straw—and was otherwise polite, but she came back after a few minutes.

**Customer:** Can I have a straw?

**Me:** Sorry, but we don't carry disposable straws for the safety of our animals.

**Customer:** The *animals?!* What about *my* safety?!

Co-worker on the next register just looked at me and I looked at her. Both of us entirely bewildered. I wasn't really sure how drinking without a straw was unsafe. Was she gonna drown or something?

**Me:** Uh, in the past, people have thrown the straws into the animal enclosures, so—

**Customer:** How does a place not have straws? How am I even supposed to drink this?!

At this point my co-worker and I performed a beautiful piece of synchronized psychic ballet. We curled our hands like we were holding cups, put our invisible cups to our mouths, and tilted our heads back slightly. The woman walked away in a huff, complaining to her husband.

I mean, seriously. You likely drink without a straw at home. But apparently when they're out, this becomes suddenly impossible for so many people. *Life threatening*, even.",Animal safety? What about MY safety?!,609,talesFromRetail
Scotch_Rawks,22,,105,1f5hef,,506,"I spent upwards of two years in high school working for a franchised coffee shop that was directly between a halfway house and the city hospital, and I can never tell my friends one of my (many) stories without being directed here. Here's a personal favorite:


So it was probably around noon on drive-thru. I was always the coffee guy, so I stood right around the corner from the cash window. My managers office door (always open when she was there) faced into the drive-thru area of our store, so she could always see/talk to us. She could also see the cameras at all times on her computer. I was in the middle of a conversation with her when she suddenly became visibly distracted by whatever was on her computer screen, leaning in and squinting. At this point I had more seniority than everybody (managers included) at this particular store, so I was like everybody's right-hand-man. She calls me over and points to the small window on the upper-left of the screen, where I see the drive-thru camera, and what appears to be a shirtless Asian dude doing a Sam-Fisher style wall slink up to the window. She promptly stood up, walked over to the window, gently moved the cash guy to the side and leaned out, looking directly to the right.   



""Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?""


No response from secret-agent-drive-thru, but we did notice that he had a makeshift cape tied on his back, probably a shirt or sweater. He gets all skittish and runs around the side of the building in the direction of the halfway home. Fair enough, we've seen weirder. 


Ten minutes later, a customer pulls up to the speaker box and we all hear through our headsets: 


""What's up with Jackie Chan in the parking lot?""


So the drive-thru team collectively turns to look through the front windows of the store, to see our caped friend (still shirtless) standing in the middle of the parking lot doing kung fu or something for no reason. Naturally, the weekend crew of teenagers thought it was hilarious, but my manager decided it was time to call the police (note: we got some REAL characters, it was usually a safe assumption that anybody who didn't get the message the first time was not going to listen a second time).


What followed was the most entertaining thing I have ever seen through a drive-thru window. Apparently the local police had previously encountered this man, so they showed up with *three* squad cars and cornered him at an intersection, where he continued to jump around and do kung fu before squirreling his way out of the street and into some bushes. The police just sort of looked at each other for a minute and drove off, although one of them walked back to the store and told our manager to let them know if he came back. He didn't.

[deleted],67,,115,16zpmd,,502,"So I was working the afternoon shift the other day, and a woman came through with two mangoes. I put them into the computer, being my polite self, and said: 

&gt; Me: ""That comes to two dollars, would you like a bag at all?"" 

to which she dumped a handful of coins in my hand, grabbed her fruit and started walking off. Now, because I needed to count the coins, I called after her: 

&gt; Me: ""Ma'am, could I just get you to wait for a second while I count the coins?""

&gt; Her: ""It's all there, I counted it!""

&gt; Me: ""Ah well I do need to count them just in case you've miscounted and given me too much, or too little.""

It took me literally 1 or 2 more seconds to count the rest of her coins, which as she expected were exactly to the amount of $2.00.

&gt; Me: ""Ok thanks, That's right. Have a great afternoon!""

She then immediately stalked over to my supervisor and started complaining. I talked to my supervisor about it later, and it turns out that I was actually ""Very rude and sarcastic"", that I treated her as if she were ""an untrustworthy individual"" and that she ""doesn't deserve to be treated like this in this kind of establishment"".

I have a short one today. Short especially by my standards of writing.  So today's story, we harken back to the days of old, December 2008, for today's adventure...

**A Tale of Two Idiots**

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Bush's time in office was numbered.  America was hopeful that some black dude from Chicago could be black, and therefore, cooler than our white, semi retarded president from Texas.  The Olympics that year were already a faded memory, except for that one guy who won like 40 medals for swimming and smoked pot. USA USA USA!  A man was impregnated.  Beyonce was advising men across the nation that if you like it, then you should indeed, put a ring on it.  The terrible scourge that we now know as ""Beiber Fever"" was in the future, and we were all blissfully unaware of how it would come and sweep the nation.

Oh and there was this financial crisis thing you may have heard about. Probably not. It was WOEFULLY under reported in the media.  It's only our stock market collapsing after all.  Stories about a guy who used to be a woman getting pregnant are much more interesting and important, because, America.

Anyways, I was working LP at a Blue and Yellow shirted electronic retailer.  The month before, our red shirted enemies at Circuit City had declared bankruptcy and closed down. Huzzah. Just proving once again in the long standing battle of Red Vs Blue, that Red sucks, and Blue will always triumph. Even if we have a teamkiller named Caboose on our side.  

Anyways, it's holiday season, busy time for all. Especially busy as our main rival in retail was no longer here. So we were seeing a lot of new customers. Management was happy, the company was ecstatic because apparently they had never heard of this little site Amazon.com. If you haven't either I suggest checking them out. It's a gamble, being as they are so small, but its definitely worth it.

Anyways, I'm working at my podium, searching cameras, looking like Big Bird in my Khaki pants and Bright Yellow polo.  Like a sexy, sexy Big Bird of Justice!  When off at customer service, I hear a commotion.  What is this?  Danger afoot! DRUNKEN_BLACK_BELT AWAY!

I had my co worker watch the cameras and doors while I walked over to see who was yelling and cursing up in my store, and why.  I see a middle aged man, red faced, yelling at an associate, who was as equally red faced out of frustration.  Now this co worker was a nice enough guy. Showed up for each shift on time, did his work, was pleasant to talk to. He just wasn't smart.  I mean this kid was so dumb, he was about as sharp as a marble.  Believe me when I tell you this kid was so dumb that he thought that OJ really was innocent.  If you showed him how to do something, gave him a little hands on experience, he got it, and was fine. But if anything deviated from that training, he was about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop.

So I naturally assumed he was trying to do something he wasn't sure about and too shy to ask for help.  Getting berated by this poor customer wasn't helping, and I could see this co worker, ""TJ"" looking like he just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

As I walked over, the man stopped yelling, mid rant and stared at me. 

Angry Man: Are you a manager?  Can you help me with this idiot?

Now he still had anger spittle dangling from his lips as he said this.  Meanwhile, TJ was staring at me, pleading with his eyes for me to save him.  Well, I may not have been the LP that store deserved, but I was the LP that store needed....

Me: Sir, I work LP, but I'll try to assist the best I can.

AM: Well I want to return this item, it's defective. But your employee here can't seem to find it in the system.  I understand you are all kids and older fuck ups who can't get a real job here, but how hard can it be?

Me:  Sir, I'll do what I can to assist.  However I'm gonna need you to stop yelling and not talk to us like that if you want help.  OK?  

AM: Whatever, long as you can actually do something, or find me someone who can.

AM: Ok, whats going on TJ?

TJ: I scan it, and its not showing up. Neither the receipt or the product itself.  I can't figure it out.

Now, I want to be a cop.  I eventually would like to work as a detective. I've always enjoyed a good mystery, and like to think I have an eye for detail.  So any sort of mystery to be solved is right up my alley.  But looking at the situation in front of me, all I wanted to do was punch TJ in the face, and then follow it up with a swift kick to the balls of the customer, to make sure he can never reproduce idiot spawn.  For you see, the packaging for the item in question was a brand that was owned, and sold, exclusively at Circuit City. And next to the product itself, was a receipt, with the words CIRCUIT CITY clearly printed on the top of it.

A long moment passed.  Maybe this was a prank?  Am I being Punk'd, as it were?  Asthon Kutcher, you son of a bitch. You've made a fool of me for the last time.  

Alas, it wasn't a prank, just two brain dead human beings. One with his head in the clouds, another with his head so far up his ass that he'd have to cut his own nipples off just to see.

Me: Well, it seems the issue is that this product wasn't purchased at *Rest Ruy*.  

AM: What? 

Me: Well, Sir, and TJ, you can both clearly this receipt says ""Circuit City"" at the top.  Also this item was made for, and sold exclusively at Circuit City.  So that's probably the issue.

TJ at this point looked like he was going to die of embarrassment.  I felt bad, he was a loveable goof.  

Angry Man looks at TJ and with a voice of superiority says ""And you couldn't figure that out? You had to have someone help you?""

I honestly felt like my brain was going to pop.  I thought after hearing something so stupid, I'd just go insane, be relegated to a hospital for the rest of life to chase butterflies and drool into my supper every night. Luckily, my mind is strong, and my mental fortitude allowed me go on.

Me: Sir, might I point out that you were the one who brought this here ?  

AM: Well yea!

Me:........

AM: YOUR POINT?

Me: My point is that you're calling him an idiot, for not recognizing that it's a competitor's item, yet you didn't realize the same thing?

AM: I KNEW! But I brought it here to return it!

Me: Yea. But it's a competitor's item.

AM: Yea a competitor who is closed now!

Me: Yes.

AM: Good so you see my point!

At this point,  I felt certain my children would be born with the intelligence of a snail with down syndrome, just from conversing with this man.  I had no idea what he was getting at.

Me: I'm sorry, but it seems like you are saying the same things I am, but you're arriving at a different conclusion. So could you explain to me what exactly you think was going to happen when you returned this, and why?

AM:  Jesus christ.  Circuit City is closed.  I can't return my items there anymore.  You guys are still open. So you can do their returns.

Me: No, No we can't.  They are a competitor.  Even when they were open we couldn't return items from them. I don't know why them closing would change anything.

AM: Well why wouldn't you? You'll get the money they lost.

Me:.... No. You spent money there and got a product.  Then if you returned it here, we'd have no way to process the return. Even if we could, we would be giving you a product from our stock. So we'd lose money on that product.

AM: Listen just because you work retail doesn't mean you know how business works.

Me: Oooooook.  Yea listen, this is getting nowhere.  You can't return it here.  Simple as that. We don't want to do it, and even if we did, there is no way to do it, as we can't accept this item into our stock, or give you the same exact item.  Follow?

AM: Get your manager. 

I sent TJ to find a manager.  If this guy was left alone with TJ I'm sure he'd continue to berate him.  I just sat and stared while the guy mumbled under his breath and glared at me.  Luckily, it was Manny, our cool manager on at the time. Manny was my direct manager, and a great guy. Old school Italian guy who was easy to get along with, took care of his employees, and knew the business.

Manny walks over, and I explain the situation.  Manny looked at me and asked AM if this was some sort of prank. AM scoffed and got angry, saying how no one here knew what the fuck they were doing, and this is why he never shopped here. He just didn't have a choice now because Circuit City was closed. Manny just laughed, and said that if he was indicative of the customers that Circuit City catered too, no wonder they went out of business.  AM got angry, and said ""You just lost a big customer!""  

Naturally Manny just laughed and said ""You never shopped here. How did we lose you if you weren't a customer?""

AM stomped out, hooting and hollering the whole time about what a bunch of idiots we were. I walked him out letting him rant, and laughing and smiling the whole time.  TJ thanked me, and apologized.  We had a laugh, and he bought me a Red Robin burger and fries for lunch to thank me.

 Well, i work at one of those mart stores, and i just walk in for my shift, clock in and get to work, the usual leveling and just maintenance, but within 10 minutes, all of that changed. About 2 aisles down, i hear a loud smash. As i'm walking over to investigate the loud noise, i see one kid, around 17 years old on the ground, and milk, milk EVERYWHERE. I also see another kid down the aisle with his phone out, so right away i assume that they are making one of these stupid videos, but i'm not aloud to do anything about it, so i ask if he's alright and get to cleaning. As I start cleaning though, i see the security camera person running to the front of the store, then she comes walking back with the 2 kids, and they go into the back office. After i'm all done cleaning up the mess, which took like an hour to do, I walk into the back to put away the cleaning supplies, and see the cops there yelling at the kid! :D The look on the kids face was priceless, he looked so scared!
  
  Later in the day, i see the kid walking out of the store with his mom, and she is ripping him a new one, bad. It was so awesome though! She was so mad telling him hes grounded forever and that hes never going anywhere alone again, i was cracking up in my aisle.
 
 Thought i'd just let you guys know about my first annoying retail experience / the justice that happened! 

*Edit* I also forgot to mention the other little piece of justice that occurred, the cops made him delete the video off of his phone, roflol!

legomaniac89,36,,108,1hafen,,498,"So in my 7 years at the same pet supply/garden center store, I've seen a lot of employees come and go. My bosses are notorious for being horrible judges of character when hiring, and are known for hiring people that turn into veritable nightmares. So I thought I'd share a few of the more memorable ones over the past few years.

Before I continue, it should be noted that my store is a small family owned business. My managers are the co-owners of the store and they make all of the hiring decisions and whatnot. They are notably lenient when it comes to enforcing store policy, and honestly, you've gotta try pretty hard to get fired from this place. We have a lot more freedom than what you would have in a typical retail chain. Right, enough of the boring stuff. Onward!

* The first notably bad employee they hired was a kid of about 16 years old, we'll call him Creeper Kid. CK had a very thin peach fuzz pre-pubescent mustache that made him look like a young porno film director, and had a creepy smile that made him look like he was visualizing you without clothes. He also didn't have a single shred of common sense. Bad enough as it is, but it gets worse.

   CK was incredibly lazy. He was hired primarily to work with me in stocking shelves and carrying heavy things out to customers' cars. Normally, he'd clock in, put two bags of dog food on the shelves, and plop down in the back and play on his phone. Now occasionally the stock boys would play the ""not it!"" or the ""nose goes"" game when it came to carryouts, and every once in a while it was fine. But CK took advantage of this, and every time he heard the intercom beep, before the page even started, he'd yell out ""not it!"" and refused to do anything that involved him moving.

   The last straw was when he came into work all excited that he had just bought a new blade for his box cutter. He decided to demonstrate for me just how sharp this blade was by slicing off the top of what else, but an empty 20oz soda bottle. He was right, the blade was quite sharp, and it did a great job slashing a 3"" gash in the side of his hand. He was rushed to the hospital for stitches, came back the next day and tried to claim worker's compensation for an injury while on the job, lying about how he had cut himself. I had already told my managers what had actually happened, and his claim was denied. He was fired shortly after. Total time of employment: 2 months.

* The next gem of an employee comes from the pet department. After CK got fired, I had migrated from stocking shelves to working in the pet dpt.  This is where Big Fat Fuck comes in. He was about 6' tall and almost as wide, and *always* had a Mountain Dew in his hand. BFF was hired for one thing and one thing only: to clean animal cages. The one thing he never did was clean animal cages. He would waddle up to the display cages in the middle of the animal room, flop his Pillsbury Doughboy belly up on the cages, and start bitching about how hard he worked and how he deserved a raise and how he just wanted to go home and play GTA.

   BFF's downfall came on a Saturday morning. He had been told by my boss to get the mouse cages cleaned Thusday, and again on Friday when he didn't get them done the day before. BFF was already on thin ice with my managers, and I had been explicitly told to NOT clean any cages, as BFF was supposed to get them done. Saturday rolls around and these cages still hadn't been cleaned. BFF dicked around all morning until lunch time, he clocks out, and as he lumbers by the animal room, he lets loose the single sentence that to this day still makes my blood boil.

   ""Hey legomaniac89, &lt;manager&gt; told me to tell you that you need to clean those mouse cages before I get back from lunch""

   I stood there in absolute shock for a moment as the rage built up inside of me. I was more pissed than I think I have ever been, and I am not an angry person. I am very easy going and you'd have to try really hard to get me pissed off enough where I just rage uncontrollably. But BFF did it. I stormed up to my manager on duty, explained (e.g. shouted) to him what happened and that either BFF goes or I do. He was fired that evening. Total time of employment: 1 month.

* Next in the lineup is Desperate Creeper Chick. DCC was in her mid-20s, bisexual, and about a 3/10 in the looks department. Thinking back on it, she could have been a real-life version of Lumpy Space Princess. She would repeatedly ask every employee moderately close to her age range (myself included) if they wanted to come over to her house for a ""sleepover"". After being shut down over and over by everyone in the store, she started asking any customers that she found remotely attractive the same thing. Needless to say, this didn't go over so well with people, and when the awkward ""I think your employee is hitting on me"" complaints began to roll in, DCC was canned. Total time of employment: 3 weeks.

Well, that got a lot longer than I had thought. FFS OP, STFU already! Ok ok, fine. I have several more stories about failed coworkers I'll share in a Part II.

AshieeRose,80,,98,1mppj6,,503,"In my grocery store, there's a checkout lane that is suited for disabled people in scooters, wheelchairs, etc. I'm normally put on that checkout lane for my shift (not that I mind - it's the first lane that customers see, so I'm always busy).

Because of this, and other encounters, I'm... extremely sensitive to people who single out the disabled/disfigured, whether they mean to or not. 

People stare, people tell others to stop staring (I've always wondered if this is just as bad as people staring), and people treat the disabled like delicate little flowers, or even worse, like they're retarded.

This one, though...

It was mid-afternoon, so there were school kids in the store. There was also a woman who appeared to have some sort of palsy, a noticeable limp and a couple of other small things. Made her way around easily enough, and saw me first, so I served her. 

Lovely lady, such a nice attitude, but did say her day was soured by a couple of kids laughing at her making her way around the store. I apologized to her, told her that her dress was gorgeous, and sent her on her way with her groceries. 

Little did I know, I had to serve the two children, and their mother. I greeted them, but as I'm scanning their items, I hear...

**""I wonder if that chick was retarded and talks all like 'Duhhhhhrrr'""**

**""I bet she drooled all over the cashier.""**

**""I hope she falls over, idiot should have a walking stick.""**

The mother does nothing. I keep my head down, scanning, trying to calm myself down because at this point, my blood's boiling. 

Then they start mimicking the woman's limp, and asking why doctors didn't put her down like a dog. I finally had heard enough.

**Me: Can you please stop? That's such a cruel thing to say.**

*Now* the mother chimes in.

**Mother: Oh, they're just kids, that's how kids are.** (Kids that look to be 10 - old enough to know that it's fucking rude to mock and insult a disabled person)

**Me: Ma'am, I'm 21 years of age. I was confined to a wheelchair and had a pretty bad limp when I was in my early teens, and I had people tease me about it. What your kids are saying is so rude and hurtful, they have no idea.**

**Mother: *-shrugs-* That's kids, for you. They'll grow out of it.**

**Me: I grew out of it at five. I stared at someone, and my mother told me to not be rude. It doesn't matter what ailments someone has, they're still human, and they deserve to be treated like such. *Nobody* deserves to be teased - being a child doesn't excuse you.**

I wasn't rude, or shouting, but man was I furious with both the kids' behavior, and how nonchalant their mother was about it. 

I turned to the kids, ""By the way, I served that lady. No, she didn't walk around and say 'Duhhhhhrr', and no, she didn't drool on me. She walks just fine, and had had a great day, until you two teased her."" 

They hung their heads and said sorry, and left with their mother, who was a bit stunned that I said something. 

I just don't understand it. Why is blatant bullying being seen as something that kids just do, now? Why is it so hard to treat disabled people just like any other person?

I don't get it.

CurvedStraightLine,34,,92,1h7q7e,,498,"Continuing on with my stories from my old job.

We had a customer I will call Eleanor, due to her resemblance to Eleanor Roosevelt.  She had a constant look on her face of vague confusion, as though she was just planted on this Earth and hadn't figured out the customs.  Eleanor was considered one of our top customers--in our store, it meant she spent over $3000 on average a month.

Eleanor's preferred method of shopping was to come in, walk to the back of the store, plant herself on one of the couches, and demand employees bring her certain clothes.  She'd literally wave down the closest employee and demand ""Bring me a skirt.  Something colorful.""  or ""Bring me a jacket.""

Normally, this wasn't too much of an issue, but she refused to schedule secret shop times, so having one employee dedicated to just her was occasionally difficult.  On one particularly busy day when I had a few call offs, I knelt down beside her and quietly said ""I'm really sorry Eleanor, but I don't have the staff to bring you clothes today.""

She stared at me, bewildered.  ""Then how do I shop?""  She literally couldn't consider that she could walk around the store and select her own clothing.

We also had issues with her mistaking other customers for employees, and suddenly some woman shopping would feel someone grab their skirt and demand that they bring Eleanor pants.

Eleanor was constantly planning trips.  We kept dossiers on our best customers, and hers read like an adventure novel.  Cruises through the Keys.  Trips to the Caribbean.  Italy for the fall.  A time share in Cape Cod.  Each with a new set of mix and match clothes for her to wear. She'd brag that her husband was an executive in a locally based large business. She'd name drop the local elite.  I had plenty of customers who did that, it wasn't a big thing.  We'd all just nod and take her money.

Eleanor would veto clothes for ridiculous reasons.  ""Those flowers are too flowery."" she'd say to a skirt.  But we quickly found that if you took something away, then brought it back a moment later, she'd love it the second time.

One day Eleanor asked for a skirt.  She had me hold it in front of her, staring at it intensely, then suddenly shut her eyes and looked away for a moment.  Then she stared at it intensely, then closed her eyes.  Then told me to take it away and bring another. 

We went through this look then look away routine with a few different garments before I finally just asked what she was doing.

Her sister in law, it seems just redecorated her living room.  She was going there for dinner and planned to sit on the sofa.  For this, she wanted to make sure she coordinated with the new interior decorating.

That little episode started a new stage in Eleanor's shopping.  She would still demand clothes, but when she tried them on, she'd prance through the fitting suite, alternating between looking at her own reflection and closing her eyes in let's pretend.  ""Can you picture me wearing this on the sands of Aruba?"" she'd ask.  We'd all agree it was Aruba sands appropriate.

One day she was looking for something that was good for Italy.  We had some marketing from the previous fall laying around that was Tuscany themed, and I held it up behind her as backdrop.  She loved it.

Then came the day that we got a new employee in.  She went to Eleanor's church.  I'm sure everyone in retail has had a moment where someone hasn't recognized you out of context.  This was one of those moments.  

Eleanor is sitting there, letting this woman bring her things, running her mouth about the fabulous places she's going and who she knows.  Finally my employee just goes ""Now, Eleanor.  You know none of that is true.""

There's a stunned silence.  Eleanor's eyes go wide.  She tries on her things, quietly, then leaves, quietly.

We find out from my employee Eleanor was the much younger wife of a man she had known for years.  Yes, he used to work for the company she mentioned, but not nearly as high ranking as she claimed.  Plus, he'd been retired for years.  The vacations?  Pretty much all not true.

Eleanor though, wasn't the smartest of women, and she came back in.  If the employee who knew her wasn't there, she'd spin her stories.  If she was, she'd buy one or two things quietly.

Then one day, Eleanor's husband came in.  He was elderly and pissed.  Turns out that Eleanor had been maxing out credit cards she was taking out without his knowledge.  He had two huge bags of clothes to return, things from months ago, tags still in place.  All bought to support her personal fantasy world.  

Her husband wanted us to deny her service from that day on.  We couldn't do that, so he just started going with her when she shopped.  He'd demand she get up to do her own shopping, and she would get one, maybe two items per visit.

But when you were alone with her back in the fitting suite, she'd still whisper that her husband doesn't want us to know she's wearing this or that to the governor's mansion this weekend.  We'd nod and act amazed.  It was just sad.

Eleanor quietly dropped off of our best customers list.",Eleanor... NONE of that is true.,590,talesFromRetail

[My Bookseller Days #3 or That's Not Britney Spears!] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1d6lpx/my_goofy_coworker_or_thats_not_britney_spears_my/)


About 10 years ago, I was in college and working at a bookstore.  My favorite job ever, maybe sometime I'll write out how I lost it.  I used to joke that, in contrast to the grocery store job I'd had before it, ""at least all my customers here can read!""  But you still sometimes still got the stupids...

One day, a lady approached the front and asked for help locating the atlas and map section.  I escorted her there and asked if she was looking for anything in particular.  

Lady:  ""No.  Well... Do your atlases come in audio?""

I was flabbergasted.  Atlases are just big books of maps.  I managed to reply, ""No ma'am, they don't."" without sounding too unprofessional, and escaped ASAP.

As soon as I saw her leave the store I told my co-workers and we all had a good laugh.  For weeks afterwards we entertained each other by imagining ""Audio Atlases"".

Me:  ""And Japan is here.  And Greenland is here.  And North Dakota is here.  And Russia is over there.""

Co-worker:  Canada is a large yellow country directly above The United States of America, which is pink.

1piperpiping,52,,93,1isfgc,,497,"Another post here reminded me of this tale.  It took place years ago when I was in high school and working as a cashier/cart jockey in a supermarket.

One day I come in and our assistant manager is really pissed.  Earlier in the day, this one cashier, Dave, let a guy leave with $80 ish in groceries without paying.  Dave was also in high school like me, but was a really naive guy.  I think he'd been home-schooled until high school and was incredibly trusting.  Some guy came in, went grocery shopping, and didn't have his wallet.  Dave let him leave with the groceries because the guy left his shoes there and said he'd be back with money in two hours.  Dave, being super trusting, thought this was fair and let the guy leave.

Understandably, the assistant manager was mad at Dave and sent him home.  She told him that he was fired unless this guy showed up for his shoes with money.  The shoes in question were pretty well-worn sneakers, they weren't worth anything.  

About an hour into my shift, this guy shows up asking about his shoes and waving his wallet around.  He actually came back, paid for the groceries, thanked the store profusely, and left with his shoes.  Dave got to keep his job because the assistant manager kept her word.

Dave comes in the next day and everyone is teasing him for being stupid.  He goes ""I'm not stupid, like I said, that guy came back and paid"".  Our Store Manager, who had heard the whole story just looks him dead in the eyes and says ""You're still an idiot Dave"".",You're still an idiot Dave,590,talesFromRetail

Just before going out to do the carts, I was ""helping"" a cranky old bastard (COB) get an idler pulley for his truck. He came up to the desk and said:

&gt; I need a part for my car

Well, in case you didn't know, we are a parts department. We have many parts for many cars. What car do you have and what part do you want?

Anyways, I survived his grumbling about my incompetence and got him his part.

As I was getting the carts together in the cart coral, he walks out the door, pushing the car with one hand and carrying the pulley with the other. Since it was too difficult to walk the cart over to the coral, he just pushed it towards the wrong side of the coral.

Well, it was just his luck that our parking lot is far from even. As the cart is headed towards the coral, it started a gentle right turn towards his car. Then he started yelling.

&gt; Hey kid! Go grab that cart, its going to hit my car!

I heard it, but pretended that I didn't because of all the noise the carts were making. He was an ass towards me, tried his best to belittle me, and made me feel like shit. The last thing I was going to do is to help him.

He now starts screaming at me, and I look up just in time to see the cart put a little dent int his rear left door. At this point, COB went properly ape-shit. He went off at me for ""damaging his car"" and saying he was going to sue me and get me fired. After he final stopped screaming at me I said:

The lady comes up to me ""Is it fixed yet?"" she says while smoking her cig. ""Yes Ma'am, i believe the reason why your PC won't turn on is because it's-"", she abruptly interrupts me ""I dont fucking care for your explanations. I want mah PC workin"" while still smoking that cig. God the house stinks, like rotting animals and feces and old smoke, I'm in a rush to get this done. I turn the PC on and viola it's fixed!

I unplug everything, ground myself as to not ruin her PC. I open up the case, and smoke comes out of it. Right away I know her PC is fried. I look inside and the inside was covered in dust and roaches. Roaches started pouring out once I opened the casing. 

Not much i can do, PC is fried, and I'm not paid to kill roaches. I put the casing back on, get up and explain to her why her PC isn't working.

heyjammy,65,,122,1ocoza,,500,"Second post here, [my previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1lgvs7/you_havent_helped_me_at_all/) if it interests you at all. 

Preface: I have been working retail 7 years. I am currently a manager of a sewing machine store, where I sell sewing machines and their accessories, offer owner classes for the machines we sell (show you how to use our machines, not sewing lessons) and we accept machines for repairs, but send them out to a local repair man that we have a contract with.

My store is a little vendor shop located inside of a popular fabric and craft store. They are having a sale (actually, they are pretty much always having a sale. Just this sale happens to be for Columbus Day) and the store was packed and busy all day long. It was almost 6pm, so I was closing up. My business hours are shorter than the hours of the popular fabric and craft store. 

As I am printing out closing paperwork and cleaning up my store, my thread rack (imagine [this](http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh289/LynnViehl/Thread.jpg) but larger and with 4 sides that spins around) moves a bit and I hear mumbling. I step over to assist whomever is deciding now is the time to buy embroidery thread and who do I see? A three or four girl whispering to herself as she plucks spools of thread from one spot and shoves it into another spot. 

I wasn't about to yell at the little girl, because she wasn't really destroying anything, but seriously, it's annoying to have to reorder dozens of nearly identically colored spools of thread. So I say to her in a soft tone of voice, ""Hey, whacha doin'?""

She stops moving, holding in her hands a spool of honey and sky blue thread. Looks at me, at the thread rack, back at me and then puts the thread back where it belongs.

At about this point her mother looks up and sees I MUST have said something to her daughter, but sees her with her hands putting thread away. and chimes in ""OH, she's just helping you organize!"" and the little girl walked away, knowing she won't get in trouble. 

I return to my closing duties and think nothing of anything else. I'll double check my thread organization another day. It's time for me to leave. I grabbed my purse and had just clocked out.

The mother, however in this passed minute or so has decided she must avenge her daughter, who in all honesty seemed unphazed by me stopping her from reorganizing my thread rack. The mother waved me over to her and looked at me and said the following: ""You know, she really didn't do anything wrong. She was helping you. I can't have my daughter think she was bad. This could **REALLY** scar her for life.""

I look at the little girl who is happy as a fucking crab, grabbing bolts of snuggle flannel and chirping about owl prints. I look back at the mother, as she continued: ""I think you should apologize.""

I look at the girl again, back at the mother and decided, its not worth it to do anything. Not say a damn thing to her, because all it would do is cause more of a problem. And being that I am a separate business that I manage from the store she was shopping in, it wasn't like she could tell on me to the fabric store's manager. Like I could be ""wrote up"" for not apologizing to a little girl who was actively disorganizing the fabric store and by relation, my store as well. I shook my head and walked away. The mother didn't chase after me or yell for me. I just walked away.","""I think you should apologize.""",622,talesFromRetail

Because we're often busy ringing people up, the phone calls can be a little tricky. Here was an interesting experience I went through...

I was stocking products by the front of the store while a co-worker of mine was working the register on a very busy day, with the phones constantly ringing. I tried to help her out whenever I could, but the products needed to get out on the floor ASAP. At one point she gets a call from a woman asking her to check to see if a product is in stock. My co-worker tells her she needs to put her on hold for one minute to connect her to stock so they can check on the product. The woman gets angry (loudly enough that I can hear it on a busy day while stocking the shelves), telling my co-worker she should go check the product herself. My co-worker tries to explain that she is both answering phones and ringing up customers on register, and she cannot leave the register. 

I can hear that it is a stock call, so I come up to answer the call about thirty seconds after the woman has been put on hold. I answer the call and ask how I can help her. She then tells me she has a question for the fish department. This is not at all what she told my co-worker, and I can do stock but know nothing about fish, fish questions need to be directed to our fish specialist. I tell the woman I need to put her on hold again to connect her to the fish department.

At this point, she gets ANGRY. She starts yelling at me, telling me that she CANNOT be put on hold again, as she has been on hold for the last TWENTY MINUTES and reconnected SIX TIMES. I absolutely MUST answer her question now because it is my job.

I wait for her to finish, and calmly tell her I am not a fish specialist and cannot help her. Furthermore, I've been standing by the register since she first called the store a full minute and a half ago. Therefore, she should probably stop wasting our time by saying things that aren't true, and I'd be happy to connect  her to fish.

Woo... I was pretty sure I knew where this was going, But I was at work, so I had to be nice, so I politely told her that we don't have any christian games. 

&gt; ""Oh, well how about some Christian **karaoke** games for the Wii?""

What? I just told you we don't have any Christian video games. Specifying isn't going to magically make some appear. Again, I told her we didn't have any.

&gt; ""Yeah, of course I have, he cleans the floors in the morning. Nice guy."" (Just a note, one of our cleaning guys IS named Jesús, and a few of my coworkers have mistakenly read his name as Jesus.)


&gt; ""NO NO NO!"" the woman exclaimed ""I'm not talking about 'hey-zoos', I'm talking about JEEEEEZ-US! Our Lord and Savior!""

&gt; ""Oh... well I'm not sure who you're talking about then..."" I replied with a completely straight face. ""I don't know any Lords or any other kind of royalty.""

but today, i've got more of an annoying one than mean.

So I was working my normal box shift, doing my normal box duties. helping customers, manning customer service, the phones, and selling tickets. it was slow for a friday because pacific rim and grown ups 2 were our only new releases, and were rather small. So i'm doing my normal sales when a lady comes up and asks for 2 tickets to pacific rim. No problem, I put it into my till and ask her for the 20.00.

then the first annoyance happens. she hands me a card that's demagnatized, which happens pretty often,I figure i'll just manually punch it in.

something that should be known by the public about punching in credit/debit cards is that you need the info on the card. AND a zip code. a lot of people look at me like I have two heads when I ask for their zipcode, but usually it's not a big deal.

well today it was. I told the lady ""i'm going to have to manually punch in your card because the magnetic strip is worn down"" she agrees and I spend the next minute and a half trying to punch in the numbers on our finnicky touch screened tills. I finally get all the card info in and ask the woman for her zip code. 

She replies with ""I don't give out my zip code""

What. okay, whatever I need it to put in the transaction. ""mam, i'm afraid I can't sell tickets without your zip code. The system requires it to be put in if the card can't be scanned""

Her: well then just scan the card

me: mam, I can't this strip won't work. you either need to get a new card soon or you will have to start giving your zipcode at POS transactions...

We go back in forth when I get an idea.

me: actually mam, i'll try swiping it. But since the sale is 20 dollars or over, I'll need to see her i.d

she had no problem with this... good... verrrry good. 

I then proceeded to manually punch in her card info, take a look at her I.D which stated her zip code, and punched it in. Finally this sale was over.

m1kepro,48,,88,1br122,,493,"Six and a half years ago, I worked for a computer corporation that was in the early stages of their retail store venture. I could point to any of a dozen reasons for why I left. My father and I went into business together, the store manager had self-confidence issues and took it out on anyone taller than his 4’7” self, poor scheduling, the practice of patting us down where customers could see because someone was stealing from Back of House... all good reasons. But let me tell you about the day that made me decide that I can no longer be in the business of retail-oriented customer service.

Three nights before Christmas, after working a closing shift, I got a call from a co-worker who offered to trade me his opening shift for my closing shift, so he could go to the doctor. I agreed, because I always like to do a friend a favor. As it turned out, the antacids he was taking weren’t helping his stomach pains because he needed emergency surgery to remove his appendix.

My manager, joy that he was, told me that since I traded shifts and my co-worker couldn’t show up now, I had to take my original shift too. I didn’t blame my co-worker, but I think the manager could have at least *attempted* to bring someone else in for that closing shift.

So the night drags on. Most of my work is fairly mundane. Replace an mp3 player, help a customer pick a replacement battery, format an external hard drive, etc. But I’m dragging. I’m starting to make little mistakes after completing 22 of my 26 hours of work over the course of that two days.

Finally, the end of the night approaches. But 90 minutes before the doors are set to close, everyone suddenly remembered that it’s December 23, and they all decided that little Timmy would hate them forever if he didn’t have the latest MP3 player or smartphone under the tree. So the store is all of a sudden flooded, and those of us behind the *long wooden high-top table in the back of the store* are asked to come out and help customers.

There’s only one guy scheduled for an appointment, and he won’t be here for another twenty minutes, so I go and start selling Things and Thing-related accessories. Well, this guy... let’s call him Ted... comes in and just stands there staring at a computer. He’s not touching it, not reading anything. Just staring at it. I wander over to him, and give him the normal routine. At this *non-descript, nameless computer company*, you never ask “Can I help you?” or other questions that could end a conversation with a single word. So you just engage the customer and start conversing about whatever it is they’re looking at. Ingratiate yourself.

He waves me away, says he’s waiting for something, so I wander off and help someone else. The appointment time comes, so I go back behind the *long wooden high-top table*, check to see if my guest has checked in. He hasn’t, so I shout out above the noise “Ted? Is there a Ted in the house? Ted F.!”

No response. So I go back to helping customers. Well, ten minutes later, my manager wanders over with Ted, who I’d talked to just before, and starts berating me in front of my customer about why I didn’t get ahold of him. I try to explain that I did talk to this man, he waved me away, and then I shouted for Ted for a solid thirty seconds from behind the *long wooden high top table*. Manager Fred (also a fake name) won’t hear it.

So I resolve to deal with Manager Fred later, and go on to help the customer. Well, after ignoring me twice, he’s in no mood to deal with my “attitude problem.” He reaches into his bag and pulls out a 17” notebook computer with an aluminum case that’s been dinged to hell. I ask him what the problem seems to be, and he begins to rant. It’s too long to write here, so I’ll just touch the major points. Only two months old, screen “suddenly broke” while he was asleep, shoddy workmanship, battery “only” lasts five hours, blah blah blah.

I open the screen and press the power key. The screen lights up, but is f-ed to all hell. What had happened was that he’d placed a pen, pencil, stylus, tiny marital aid, or some other device on the keyboard and had tried to close the lid. I carefully examined the machine, just trying to buy time because I knew he wouldn’t react well to what I was going to tell him, then took a deep breath and plunged in.

“Sir, as it turns out, the cause of your issues with the LCD is a pen that was placed on the keyboard on this row of keys here. I can replace the LCD, but because this is accidental damage, it isn’t covered by your ThingCare plan.”

Those were the magic words. All of a sudden, this guy is bright red and bulging out of his shirt. I attempted to stay calm, but this guy was scaring the living hell out of me. He starts to shout about how I’m attempting to rip him off, and this computer was working just fine, and he doesn’t even *own* a pen, and how dare I accuse him of being so stupid, and a hundred other things.

I wait for him to finish, and then I told him “Sir, I’m sorry, but as you can see on the LCD-” to which he replies by screaming at me about how I need to get off the drugs and stop hallucinating before I come to work. “I’m sorry, sir. That’s LCD, not LSD. As you can see, the LCD has two distinct points where the ends of a long, thin cylindrical object came in contact with the screen and crushed it. That’s why there’s these jagged points. It’s like how a windshield spiderwebs if a rock bounces on the highway and hits it.”

Well, he’s had enough of my attitude problem now. He’s leaning over the *long wooden high-top table* and yelling six inches from my face, using some seriously vile language to threaten lawsuits against my job and my company. He even at one point alluded to the idea of waiting in the parking lot for me. My manager heard the word “lawsuit” and was there in a flash to try to defuse the situation, which failed spectacularly.

Manager Fred attempts to tell Ted the same thing I did, while I’m backing away slowly. Manager Fred always had a gift for antagonizing people, and this guy was already close to physical violence. Finally, Ted shouts “That’s **NOT** accidental damage! **THIS** is accidental damage!”

He picks up his 17” computer by a corner, and flings it across the *long wooden high-top table*, as if he’s [Oddjob from GoldenEye](http://imgur.com/L7ZIvhA). It barely missed me and smashed the white plexiglass behind me. Someone had apparently heard the commotion and ran to get the mall security, who saw the guy throw the notebook at me and tackled him to the ground.

After an arrest for assault and attempted battery, police reports, sworn statements, and all sorts of other mess, I’m now well over my 26 hours of work and into hour 28, and the store is still yet to be cleaned up for closing. I clear it with my fellow workers, then go to the office in Back of House and ask Manager Fred if I can be excused early as I’ve just suffered a near injury and a terrifying experience, and the adrenaline I was running on has run out.

Manager Fred launches into a truly insulting speech about my incompetence in defusing situations, how I’m too lazy to do my job, and just as he’s starting in on me about trying to take off work early cause I’m “a big pussy,” he notices I’ve got my iPhone (first-gen, gifted to me by my former company when it premiered) out and asks what the hell I’m doing.

I reply “I just put in my two weeks via email, so it’s in writing.” He hears the email ding on the iMac behind him, shouts “You don’t *get* two weeks. You’re fired **NOW**.” and escorts me out. I smiled the whole way out, and the next morning I went to the labor offices for my state’s government and filed a report. Manager Fred was called in for a hearing some short days later. Of course, he lied his ass off, even attempting to say I never turned in a resignation letter.

I proved I did by showing them the email on my phone, and the labor board ruled that because I was fired as a result of turning in two-week notice, I was entitled to the full 80 hours of pay I should have received had I been allowed to complete the work. I thanked them, gave Fred a mocking bow so that I came down to his height, and walked out. The pay was direct deposited into my account the day after the hearing.

So that’s my story. Never told that one in it’s full form before. Thank you guys for the opportunity to get that night off my chest, and for bearing with me through that 1,500 word soliloquy of a terrible night.

Vopogon,40,,126,1plicc,,494,"A little bit of background:
So I'm the lead customer service/phone operator/online pickup coordinator at everyone's favorite electronics retailer, and am relatively new,  moving from sales. You might be able to figure it out, but for the sake of CYA I'm going to leave the actual name out... 

Now there is going to be some NSFW language past this point,  but I'm sure we've all heard worse... 

Anyway.  Its late and pretty dead when the phone rings, so I pick it up ready to really get stuff done and help the person on the other end out with whatever they need. 

""Thank you for calling Electronic Retailer in City, this is Vopogon, how can I help you tonight?"" 

""Yeah man, I need the Assassin's Creed Keyboard for PS3.""
The guy sounded like a teenager, probably around 17 or 18. 

Off the bat I'm pretty sure that doesn't even exist,  but I let him know that I'll double check (given AC4's recent release) with Joe (not real name), our Gaming super. Joe tells me that it definitely doesn't exist, however there is an Assassins Creed Keyboard online for pc, which you could use for the PS3. 

As I'm about to unmute my mic, I hear 
""Fool, I'm about to fuckin shank his bitch ass, I'm tired of him tryina get with my girl..."" 

Lovely. I better wrap this up so he can carry on his wholesome conversation. 

I relay what Joe told me and asked if he wanted me to look online real quick and see where they were available. All of a sudden...

Customer: ""WHAT'S YOUR NAME?""
Me: ""Uhh, Vopogon, what's up?""
C: ""You're fucking fired.""

At this point I think he's joking,  to which I say ""Thank you.""

C: ""FOOL, DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? I SAID YOU SUCK, DOG."" 

Oh. So he's serious. 

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way. Is there anything else I can help you with?""

C: ""Find me a fucking keyboard,  that's what I want.""

At this point I'm done. I have to put up with some bullshit, but there's a point where I refuse. 

I let out a laugh unintentionally and say ""Good luck finding one. I'm terminating the call due to your tone and what you've said to me. If you wish, you can speak to a supervisor."" 

*click*

I let my manager know and had him listen to it, worried I might have over done it, but he gave me a fist bump and agreed with my decision but should probably not laugh in the future.

Flamebrand02,99,,76,13goy8,,496,"We worked together at Sears and she. Was. Dumb.

She got hired on as seasonal help in electronics. We'll call her Sheila. Sheila didn't know anything about electronics. She couldn't even work the computer to look up dot com orders for customers.

Day two of her call-in: Comes in the actual store and proceeds to shop, during her assigned shift after having complained of being sick the last two days and then sticks around my counter while I'm covering for her absence (got called in from home to do so) and wants to gab with me about her weekend and how drunk she got! One of the appliance workers had to come pull me away because, as he put it, ""Man, I could see the vein sticking out in your forehead from across the store.""

randomfemanon,120,,138,1kk0cj,,493,"*Insert statement about how this is my first post here.*
 
I'll start off by saying I work in a fast food restaurant. I've worked here since they opened in my town, so for almost two years. It's fair to say that I've had quite a bit of time to experience terrible customers. 

This story took place about two months ago when I was on the headset, taking orders in the drive thru. My headset beeped, and there was a souped up, stereotypical redneck truck pulling up to the speakers. 

Me: ""Welcome to [redacted], my name is randomfemanon. How may I serve you?""

There was no response from the people in the truck. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. People can at least address me and say, ""Give me just a minute, please."" 

After a moment of no one talking to me, but I heard voices talking to each other, I said in a chirpy voice, ""Let me know when you're ready to order.""

Three or four minutes go by and no one in the vehicle has said a word to me. I was listening to closely, too, and I was absolutely positive no one said a word to me. I was waiting for the cue of people being ready to order.

All of a sudden, I heard a quick, sharp honk. At first, I thought it may have been an accident, because it happens to me sometimes, so I didn't respond. Then, four or five honks sounded in rapid succession. Because the headset was directly in my ear, I was a bit irritated.

Biting back a smartass response, I said kindly, ""Excuse me, is there a problem?"" 

The fuckwad in the truck said in an angry voice, ""Yeah, I'm fucking ready to order here!"" 

Then maybe you should have motherfucking told me or started ordering instead of being a total prick and just honking in my ear immediately. You can use your god damn words and form a sentence. We've evolved past this bullshit. 

Me being the passive aggressive sort simply said while trying to sound polite, ""I'm sorry, I guess I *didn't hear you tell me you were ready to order.* What can I get for you?""

**Tl;dr: Tell your god damn cashier when you're ready to order.**

This probably won't be my last post as I have tons of stories about asshole customers ranging from the creep that stayed 45 minutes after closing to hit on underage cashiers and the time I was verbally assaulted over sauce.

LadyGrizabella,35,,95,1fmoef,,491,"Come listen, children, to a Black Friday tale of long ago.

I was working at the time in a mall food court. This particular mall also has valet parking which takes up, generally, about 1/2 of the single, one level parking garage. On this particular day, however, the valet company had elected to take over a large section of the upper parking closest to the parking garage as well at some point during the morning, after I'd already parked and gone into work. Including the row where I, at oh dark thirty that morning, had parked my car.

Me: Doodledoodledoo..going to my car. Gonna go home..yay!

Valet attendant: Excuse me! EXCUSE ME! 

Me: Hmm?

Valet: You can't take your car out. You have to pay us first.

Me: I'm sorry?

skaschmidt,50,,68,1emf1c,,496,"First time posting here, and I'm no longer in retail, but I know how much those in customer service have to deal with, so I always try and be as pleasant as I can. Which, like today, will always ensure good service. Sorry for the wall of text.

So I'm at the furniture store picking out a chair. I decide on the one I like (has 4 legs, not too high or low, comfortable, average quality but a good price, you know the deal) and I place the order for the chair I want at the counter.

The kind young lady said ""That's all fine, if you could just take this receipt to the warehouse around the back of the store and ring the green button, they will bring it out for you."" She repeated this again, as I'm sure these simple instructions must baffle numerous customers each day.
Take receipt to back of store, ring green button.

So I drive around to the back of the store, where there are 3 cars waiting at the store's clearly signed warehouse door. A middle aged woman (another customer) was being very animated with her hand signals about where I should pull up. She was closest to the door, then two other cars behind her. So I pull up to the end of the line, and I'm walking towards the door when I hear from the woman in the front, let's call her WIF:

WIF: ""Excuse me, I'm first in line and I've been waiting here for 10 minutes already.""

To which I reply: ""That's fine, I'm just handing in my receipt."" as I ring the green button. She looks baffled.

A young lad (YL), about my age, comes out. 

YL: ""Hey mate, how's it going?""

Me: ""Well thanks, I'm just here to pick up a chair""

YL: Looks at recepit ""Ok man...Oh, these are right at the back of the warehouse sorry, it'll be about 5 minutes, I just have to move a few things to get to it.""

Me: ""Yeah, take your time, I'm not in a hurry.""

In an instant, WIF is at my back already raising her voice at YL. 

WIF: ""Why haven't I got my things yet?!""

YL: ""I'm sorry, have you handed in your receipt to someone?""

WIF: Confused ""What?""

YL: ""I need your receipt to see what you purchased, they would have told you to hand it in here when you were at the counter.""

WIF: ""They just told me to drive round here and you'd give me my stuff!""

YL: ""Oh I'm sorry, they should have told you to ring the green bell. I just need your receipt to know what to get from the warehouse.""

WIF: ""Ugh!"" as she troddles back to her car.

By now the other two customers had remembered that the cashier told them to hand the receipt in, and were now at the warehouse door also. So we had all handed our receipts in just as WIF had returned from her car with hers.

As she hands it into YL she states:
""Just so you know, I was here first, the woman with the baby is next, then the couple, and this guy, (pointing at me) who got here first, is the last.""

And then it happened.
YL gave me that look. I'm sure all of us in service have given that look. The unspoken eye contact where we both know what's going on that just says ""seriously?"".

Me: ""Yeah, like I said, I'm not in a hurry, so take your time.""

WIF: ""Well I AM in a hurry! AND I've already been waiting here 25 minutes! (although she told me it was 10 minutes about 2 minutes ago) SO I GET MY STUFF FIRST!""

YL: Looks at her receipt ""You purchased this at the counter 2:04, it's now 2:15.""

WIF: ""Yeah, 25 minutes!""

The looks between all of us now were priceless.

YL: Being polite enough not to make here look even more foolish ""Well I'm very sorry, but you didn't ring the bell so I didn't know you were here, I'll go get your items now.""

YL hops on his forklift and we all return to our cars. A minute later he returns with what seems to be some nursery furniture for the mother with the baby. I'm two cars length from WIF but I can still hear her claiming ""But I was first"" and ""That's her job, not yours!"" as he is helping the new mother lift and fit heavy items into her hatchback.

Young mother drives off.

And then there were three.

I was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen next, but I was also not going the be surprised if he would return with WIF's furniture just to get rid of her.

But nope. Out YL comes with an outdoor dining set for the couple in the middle.

WIF: ""Aw, for FUCK'S SAKE!""

YL: As he's passing her ""Yeah, sorry, this was right in front of your order and I had nowhere else to put it.""

WIF: ""Uuuurrrrrgghhhh!"" Like she had just stubbed her toe. 

YL: Who is now clearly giving no fucks and just wants to rub some salt in those bitchy wounds ""I'm sorry, but if you handed in your receipt when you got here, we wouldn't have this problem.""

WIF: Some under her breath muttering

YL: ""What was that, sorry?""

WIF: ""Just Hurry. THE. FUCK. UP!""

This woman is now so irate, and YL is just continuing to be the most chilled guy on earth as he helps load the couple's dining set onto their trailer.

Now it's just me and WIF. And while YL is in the warehouse, she start's yelling at me, like all this is my fault.

WIF: ""He better not bring your stuff back now, you even said that you're not in a hurry!""
Me: ""Umm...No, I'm not""

WIF: ""Why not?!""

I'm pretty sure even she knew how stupid this question was after I gave her a confused look and chose not to answer.

The heat was now on, she was tapping her feet, pacing back and forth, shaking her head. It was like someone had just told her  that someone had stolen her identity and used her credit cards to purchase shitty furniture and they also had to wait in line.

And then it happened. The knight in shining fluorescent returns with his forklift carrying one single chair. He rode straight past WIF, just smirking at me the whole time during his slow and steady voyage.

WIF: ""You have got to be fucking shitting me!""

YL just pays no attention as he very carefully helps me load up my chair.

Me: ""I know how it is man, you're doing this deliberately right?""

YL: ""Yep. And it just happens to be my smoke break now, so she can wait at least another five."" 

We both shared a little chuckle as obscenities were being screamed in our direction.

I drove of with a sense of joy, satisfaction, and a well priced piece of Chinese assembled furniture. All in all, it was a good transaction.

Sometimes, it just pays to be pleasant and follow simple instructions.

PKLKickballer,61,,98,17v8ld,,492,"Not exactly retail, but I have a small brewery and over the weekend was manning our booth at a local beer festival.  We had three varieties of beer on tap.  15 minutes before the show ended we kicked a keg, and made the call not to tap a new one since it would be a waste to give out just a few more samples, then be stuck with a not quite full keg we couldn't sell.  We took the tap handle off and removed the sign for that beer (a porter)  Two beer were still available.

A guy came up and asked about the porter, and I told him it was kicked:

Guy: I heard you have a good porter.

Me: Yup, but we just kicked the keg, sorry.  Want to try one of these others?

Guy: No, I want the porter.

Me: Sorry, it's kicked.

Guy: Tap another one.

Me: I can't do that.

Guy (pointing behind me): I see a keg right there, put it on.

At this point I'm not going to judge.  Everyone has been drinking for hours and you have to expect some lapses in judgement.  No problem.  Another guy in my booth restates what I said, the guy tries the other beers and goes on his way.

The next day I'm checking our Facebook page, and see that that morning the guy posted on our wall, ""Should have tapped the porter"".  Today, two days later, I find that he has now posted a comment on our website feedback page again decrying our decision not to tap the porter.

The first, if you missed it is [""I have cancer and a lot of money""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17fuaq/i_have_cancer_and_a_lot_of_money/) .

This event took place last spring while I was working as a cashier at the Orange competitor of the store of the previous story. 

It was just me and the Head Cashier up at the registers, and because of the really crazy spring we had last year it was 75F and busy in March (don't worry, the snow came back). So, I'm doing my job as efficiently as pleasantly as I could and then this guy shows up in my line with three products. Innocent enough. He has his son with him, and his son is probably about 26-28, so this guy was early-mid 60s, so we'll just call him CWAK (Creeper with a Kid).

I start ringing CWAK's stuff and do the pretty standard 'Did you find everything all right today?' and of course, as is the traditional response of creepers, he responds, 'No. I need a phone number.' 

So, I very hesitantly suggest that we have a phone book at the Service Desk and he might do well to check there.

CWAK of course doesn't realise that this was indeed a cue to CUT THAT SHIT OUT so he decides to clarify that it was indeed my phone number he was looking for. At this point, his son has his head buried behind his hands and looks like he wants the world to swallow him there. That or this wasn't the first time his dad had done this. Whatever.

I politely indicate that that is not available. And CWAK continues pressuring, offering a date. Then suggesting that maybe I 'check him out' too. The son is now over by the double doors, just hoping that this ends.

Eventually this guys stops his shit and realises that he's not getting my phone number by just asking so he tries as different technique. The really fucked up compliment-like-insult.

""I bet your parents are really disappointed in a girl like you working retail at your age. Don't worry, I like it.""

Ew. I'm so appalled now that I can't respond. My head cashier is giving me the 'Do I need to step in?' look. But before I can indicate one way or the other I get.

""Wow. Just look at how red you are."" Then he calls over to his son ""Look at how embarassed she is!""

At this point, I've pretty much had enough. So I respond ""Well someone needs to be embarassed for you.""

That did the trick! CWAK quietly grabbed his stuff and shuffled off, his son giving me one last look of 'I'm sorry. I can't help him' before disappearing off into the unseasonably warm afternoon.

actioncode10,112,,97,174p3j,,493,"I used to work the returns desk at a large Smiley-Faced retailer, because I did something wrong in a former life I guess. Anyway, one night this woman comes in and wants to exchange an old car battery. It was still within its warranty, but had entered the ""prorated"" portion of its guarantee. In other words, she only got some money back, not the full purchase price. I explained this to her, she was cool with it, and for simplicity's sake let's just say she was going to get $20 back, which we agreed would be applied towards the purchase of her new battery. She gets her new battery which rings up with tax to (let's just say) $40. I apply the $20 cash to the total, she pays the other $20, takes her battery and leaves.

BUT WHERE'S THE FUNNY?

The funny came 10 minutes later, when Giganto the Mountain King came thundering into the store, the battery in his big, beefy, stubby hands. Homeboy slams the battery down on the counter and just lays into me about ""ripping off his wife."" I was used to this kind of treatment, because I was in the shithole south and nobody is nice to clerks at return desks. I ask him to explain the dealio and he pulls out the receipt and *shoves* it in my face. ""Where my $20 credit!""

Oh joy.

I show the man where I had applied $20 in cash at the bottom, which had come from the return of the old battery. Nope, not good enough. He was zeroed in on the fact that the battery *rang up at the full price*. I explained to him that the $20 off was a cash credit, not a discount on the battery's regular price. He just didn't get it. AT ALL. Homey kept getting louder and louder, accused me of pocketing the $20 and making his wife pay the full price, typical moron bullshit.

Then it happened. 

After the umpteenth attempt to explain that the reason he saw two cash entries in the tender section, and showing him the slip from the return and how the amount from that equaled the first cash entry, THE FAT STUPID MOTHERFUCKER PICKS UP THE FUCKING CAR BATTERY AND THROWS IT AT ME.

He hucked it straight at my chest. I jumped back and spun to the side but it still caught my upper arm and left a hella-nasty bruise on it. The car battery landed on the floor and promptly began spewing/leaking/bleeding ACID everywhere. I look back at Giganto, whose 400lb ass is trying to come over the counter at me, and I grab the phone and use the PA system to call for every manager up to the front because EMERGENCY.

They all come running, and one manager is pulling Giganto back off the other side while the store manager (to her credit) is doing her best to neutralize the acid with baking powder and contain the mess. They FINALLY get Giganto calmed down, and then the he said/she said bullshit starts. The managers review the slips, and while they did determine I did everything by store policy, the one manager bends the truth just a hair (making up some nonsense procedural mistake I had ""made"") so Giganto could, in theory, exit the situation with a little dignity. I'm used to this tactic, so I apologize for the (completely made-up) ""error"".

That's when round two started. Giganto's wife was back in the store by now, she was crying, cops got involved, etc. Long story short: Giganto swore to God he was never come back to our store, because it was full of liars and cheats. I had a nasty bruise on my arm for a while, and the floor behind the returns desk was ruined. We reviewed the security tapes later and my direct boss couldn't believe my sweet Matrix-style moves.

Because we sell brands that are affiliated with drugs and sometimes gang related emblems, a lot of our shoplifter base are guys in gangs. And we have A LOT of shoplifters, the most in our mall. A few weeks ago, a coworker of mine and assistant manager of the store was working alone from open-five. She is petite, 5'1"" and no more than 120 pounds. We are going to call her Jane. Due to our company policy, approaching shoplifters must be with respect and kindness. We may only offer to hold their items that were clearly stuffed in their bag up at the front for them.

We identify one of them in conversation with eachother as ""kiss lip tattoo guy"" as he (and the rest of his inferred gang) have a tattoo of a red kiss mark on their necks.  This guy comes in all the time and gets away with boatloads of clothes. He is the slickest motherfucker. 

So Lip Kiss guy grabs some camo skinny jeans and asks for a fitting room. Jane lets him in. When he comes out, he doesn't have the jeans in hand (SHOCKER) and he walks over to ""shop"" around some more. Jane then notices that he has the camo jeans underneath the pants that he wore into the store, as she can see the camo print peeking up from the top of his other pant's waist band. Then she notices that he his tightly gripping the sensor in his hands, obviously looking for a hiding spot. She walks over to him, puts on her fake smile, stands about six feet away and says 

J: Did you find that on the floor? I can take that for you and put it in our bin.

KLG: What the fuck are you talking about?

J: The sensor in your hand, it's the store's property and it will set off an alarm if you walk out with it. I can put it in our sensor bin for you.

KLG: I dont have nothin' in my hands (he says, as he not-so-discreetly slips the sensor into his pocket)

J: Well, I just saw you put it in your pocket. 

Kiss Lip Guy then turns around so that his back is facing her, then just as quickly turns back around and punches Jane square in the jaw while saying ""Dumb white bitch.""

Jane fell to the ground from the force of the punch after her neck whipped around, and hit her head on our concrete floor. A woman and her two very young girls run over crying as the woman tells Jane that she is calling 911. The men (If you can even call them men) calmly walk out of the store. When Jane re-gains her ability to stand, she chases after the men making a scene in the mall so that they will be caught. She screams ""That man just punched me in the face!"" over and over while pointing at the man. All the other mall workers come out from their stores to see what the commotion is all about. When Kiss Lip Guy hears her screaming, he comes after her AGAIN. He turns around, running at her, fists ready. At this point, a man working at another store runs out and creates a barrier between Kiss Lip Guy and Jane, and this sends Kiss Lip Guy running. A pack of mall workers chase after him and got his license plate number. Jane is feeling really terrible at this point, obviously in pain. And the pain is even greater because not a week earlier Jane got a concussion while doing manual labor by herself at work and our company made her work a twelve hour shift the very next day. 


The best part about this fucked up story? Jane got punched around 3 o clock. She immediately called our District Manager (as our store is without any managers right now besides Jane who is a mere assistant still in her teen years) and she explained the situation to Our DM while crying and obviously shaken up. Our DM's response? ""Haha, Oh man that sucks. You're okay to work the rest of the day right? Just let me know how things go. Talk to you later."" And she hangs up. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. Jane then emails our DM explaining that she doesn't feel safe in the store and has had a horrible day and would like to recover at home. Our DM responds ""Well who do you think is going to come in for you? you are going to have to work with [Manager from nearby store] on that."" the message was very cold and unsympathetic in any way. Jane then calls our Loss Prevention guy and explains the situation to him and the fact that our DM wouldn't let her leave. His response? ""Oh I understand, yeah just go ahead and take a five in the back. Freshen up."" Wow, what a savior. Thanks for the five mins off, amirite? Should be enough time to recover from being physically assaulted by a grown man! 

Eight o clock rolls around, one hour before closing time, and Jane gets a call on her cell phone from human resources saying that she can leave. Gee, thanks. 

Jane then has to work two days after this incident, and every day for the rest of the week. Jane sent an email to our DM on one of these days and explains that she is quitting and cannot work her two weeks for fear of being in the store. They had not caught the guy that did this, not to mention he is, as I said, in a gang (the police confirmed this from his record of past assaults and gang affiliation) and she feared for her safety. I don't fucking blame her. Our DM then called her threatening her saying that if she quits then ""she cannot use [Store] as a reference."" Really? Worked here for three years and she can't use the store as a reference because she feels unsafe and doesn't want to be there anymore?

Sircus123,179,,131,10laj7,,490,"I sell cell phones (as some of you may have read my dozen+ posts here). I have always carried many different phones, from the iPhone to basic flip phones that can barely text. I, personally, prefer my android phone. After having an iPhone then working in the industry I made my choice. I don't hate the iPhone, selling it pays my bills, but I try to get customers to know about androids and their pros over the iPhone. Some people just want the iPhone, period. No problem, it's yours, I am not one to argue with you.

But this one guy... damn... I had to set him straight.

Before we begin, this is before the iPhone 5, and the Galaxy S3 was coming but not out yet.

Two friends come up, One guy we will call Steve, because he was the apple fanboy, the other we will call Fred. Fred wants a new phone, and wants to know about all of them. Steve keeps saying ""You're wasting your time, just get the iPhone."" Fred ignores him, and I present a few phones to him.

After going through one or two phones Steve speaks up. ""Don't listen to this guy, he just gets paid more to sell the crappy phones, isn't that right bro?""

I am not your bro. ""No, it doesn't matter what phone I sell you, I get paid the same"" (actually, a slight lie, there ARE phones I get extra spiffs on, but it is usually the cheap crappy ones and I never push those sales. Apple never gives those spiffs, but it is an easy sell for fanboys).

""I bet you got an iPhone. You know what the best is.""

""Yes, I do."" I pull out my Galaxy S2, which is one of the phones Fred was looking at. ""I love this phone, it's really great, and I would pick it over an iPhone anyday. But that is my choice.""

Fred - ""Yeah, it does seem like it's one of your-""

Steve - ""That ain't got shit on the iPhone""

*sigh* okay, this is where I start going into pushy mode. I pull up the specs on both the Galaxy S2 and the iPhone 4s. The S2 outshines it in pretty much every catagory.

Steve - ""Whatever, numbers don't mean anything! Preformance matters.""

Me - ""Can I see your iPhone?""

I open his iPhone and open the internet browser.

AFTER that I unlock my phone, open the browser. Load the homepage, then go to google, look up something random (giraffe I think) and load the wikipedia page.

Oh look, the iPhone has finished loading the homepage.

Steve - ""Well I hear Samsung makes really crappy phones, they break all the time!""

I throw my phone across the store. Pick it up, pull out a pen and stab it repeatedly on the screen. not a dent or scratch.

Me - ""Now can I see your iPhone and try that?""

Steve - ""HELL NO!""

In the end, Fred laughed at the whole spectacle. Steve tried to bring up a few arguments (more apps, easier to use, etc) but I brought them down (more FREE apps on android, more customizable to work the way you want it, etc.) In the end Fred bought the same phone I had, but Steve still said he would regret it. My boss said that was the best showcase of a phones capabilities he had ever seen. I see Steve and Fred in the mall sometimes and Fred always gives me a smile and a wave, Steve never looks at me...","I don't normally show my brand loyalty, but this customer forced my hand...",621,talesFromRetail

somethrowaway5,33,,125,1mpofd,,489,"Not sure if this happens to many people in management but it’s really starting to get under my skin. I hate being told “tell me if I’m being unreasonable” because generally it’s code for “I know I’m being unreasonable and I’d appreciate it if you told me I’m not”. I’m a straight shooter. If you ask if you’re being unreasonable and you are and I’ll flat out tell you. 

For the sake of this story I’m mid-level management at a small company.

Upper Management Person: [Employee Name Redacted] hasn’t picked up her company cell phone again when I called!

Me: When did you call her?

UMP: A few minutes ago.

Me: Did you expressly inform her that you’d be calling her at night and that you expected her to be on call? Maybe she was busy and hasn’t been able to return your call yet (ENR has a family and regular obligations).

UMP: I’ve tried calling her all day.

Me: That’s strange. I’ve been able to get through every time without any difficulty (which included at night).That would be a problem. Give me a second I’m getting a call.

UMP: Sure.

(Switch Lines)

ENR: I’ve been trying to get a hold of UMP but I keep getting voicemail. Do you know if UMP is having any problems with their cell?

Me: Not to my knowledge. I’m talking to them now. You should really try UMP again. Maybe try UMP’s second cell.

ENR: Okay I’ll do that.

(ENR hangs up, I switch lines)

Me: I’m back. ENR says she’s called you several times and has only gotten voicemail.

UMP: I don’t want to talk to her now. She’s pissed me off by not answering her phone. Why do we provide her with a phone if she can’t answer it?

(Situation deteriorates. There’s a lot of back and forth. UMP is plain pissed because of multiple incidents that aren’t ENR’s fault. UMP was not clear about expectations and did not file clear paperwork outlining ENR’s duties and that she would need to work at night. I defend ENR.).

UMP: **Well let me know if I’m being unreasonable** but I’m going to cut off her cell phone as soon as I get back and [remove 50% - 75% of job duties] so that she has more time to answer the main line.

Me: I think that’s unreasonable.

UMP: What do you mean that’s unreasonable? What about all she’s done?

Me: I still think everything you’ve mentioned could be the result of unclear communication on your behalf, coincidence, technology failure or a number of other things that warrant investigation instead of discipline. You’re also effectively firing her because she won’t be doing the same job anymore and she’ll take it as that. She’s a pretty integral part of the company and her duties need to be performed by someone. I would reconsider doing so unless you’re absolutely sure that …

UMP: I am. Again, just **tell me if I’m being unreasonable**.

Me: In my opinion you are. Look you’re free to do what you want and I’ll live with the decision you make, but that doesn’t make it a good one or the right one.

UMP: What would you do?

Me: Provide her with clear written duties informing her she’s expected to work at night, pull the cell records and let tech support test both your phones to make sure something isn’t going on. If there are discrepancies in the cell records then consider disciplining.

UMP: Well I’ve had enough already. **Tell me if I’m being unreasonable** but I think we’re just going to take her cell and [remove 50 – 75% of her duties] and be done with it.

TL;DR: Upper management uses “Tell me if I’m being unreasonable” as code for “I know this is totally unreasonable but I want you to make me feel better about this” and I don’t buy that.

queen_mcgina,52,,98,16xowv,,488,"So I use to work at a co-op grocery store when I was 18. We had this family owned construction group that use to come in multiple times a week to buy our hot table food for lunch and get some cafe drinks, and I was usually the one to ring them up. They were always incredibly polite to us and the more senior employees knew them by first-name basis. I had only been working there for a few months at this time and I'm incredibly shy, but they were slowly getting me to open up.

At the time I was working there, it wasn't mandatory to wear smocks, so I was just in my every day clothes. That day I was wearing one of my favorite shirts. It was a picture of a squid and it said ""Free hugs."" I was working the register while their group came in and ordered their drinks, so I'm making small chit-chat with them. They ask me about my infant daughter and how we are both doing (things had been really tough because I am a single mom) so I greatly appreciated them asking. Chit-chat continues and one by one they start paying for their meals.

The mother (this is a family owned construction company, so they all work and own together, and go to lunch together) finishes paying for her meal and comes up to me from around the register counter and I am freaking out a little bit. ""Ma'am? Uhm?"" is all I can mutter and she reaches out to give me a hug. She says, ""We all get a free hug with our meals today, right?"" and gave the warmest laugh I had ever heard.

DeaditeQueen,89,,121,1nqw8c,,485,"It seems most of my posts cause a myriad of emotional reactions from you, dear readers. It occurred to me while reading the comments on my last post that I have purposely avoided sharing the story of an event at the Vet Clinic that brought me to tears.

Like many people who work with animals I am far from calloused to pain, but learned to deal with it on a level where I didn't suffer burn-out. I always did my best to separate myself emotionally just enough to respect the grief of clients without wanting to jump in front of a car at the end of each shift. But everyone has their breaking points and for the first time since it happened, oh so many years ago, I think it only fair to share it with all of you.

Our clinic was open on Saturdays, but only for a few hours in the morning and with half the staff. A majority of the scheduled appointments were for simple things like vaccinations and well checks. We opened at 7am and I would arrive at 6:45 to open the front doors (our Saturday vet and owner used the backdoor to arrive very early to review patient charts for the day) and grab some coffee before ""the push"". Clients often called last minute demanding to get in (non-emergencies) and I would spend most of the morning convincing people to come on Monday, etc. Our appointments officially started at 8am; giving time for the techs to set up, prep vaccinations, etc.

It was about 7:15 when I heard a growling car engine screaming down the road. I glanced out the window to see a green Suburban take the fastest and tightest corner into our lot that id ever seen. Tires threw up smoke and left a long curve of skid marks. This was BAD. I yelled for a litter. I didn't know what kind or animal or what size but I wanted to be ready.

I dashed out the door in time to see a young man (early 20's) jump from the drivers seat while the Suburban kept running. He was vaguely familiar and his face was swollen and red the way a face can only be when you've been crying your eyes out.

""HELP ME PLEASE!!!!"" he screamed in what was probably the most desperate and heart wrenching voice I've ever heard. He had pulled up half on the sidewalk leaving only about 2 feet from the back of his vehicle to the door. He flung open the back to reveal the lifeless body of a beautiful all white husky mix. Blood was pooled in the back of the Suburban and was smeared all over his fur.

I looked only for a moment before our vet was by my side scooping the dog up and hustling him to the back. He'd worked plenty if miracles before but my instinct told me this dog had passed way before getting to us. The pure desperation in this young mans eyes was indescribable. I had witnessed emotional pain on my levels, but this was something different. This was pure selflessness. I know in my heart he would have changed places with his dog in a heartbeat.

(FYI I'm tearing up just remembering this) The owner followed the vet to the back and told him that his father had been leaving for work and didn't see the dog snoozing in the shade of of the back tire and because the dog was older and hard of hearing he could only guess that's why the dog hadn't moved when his father started the car and backed over him.

We had ""looks"" at the clinic. Most of us could communicate with those alone and the vet have me a glance that said ""This could get gory back here, take the owner upfront"". I gently took him by the crook of his arm and brought him upfront explaining they needed room to work. He was in such a daze I'm sure I could of led him into the path of an oncoming train and he would of simply followed. 

As we reached the front area a white SUV came roaring in and a tall, broad older man hopped out and ran in. It was the father. The young man turned to him but before a word could be said the door to the back opened and the vet emerged. The young man spun back around and for a millisecond our eyes met and I KNEW I was looking in the eyes of a man praying for a true miracle.

The vet put his hand on the young mans shoulder and simply said ""I'm so sorry.""

He couldn't say anything else. The young man fell to his knees pleading with unknown forces to not let it be true. The father's eyes welled up and tears fell. He went to his sons side and helped him to his feet. The son's posture shifted and before I could step back he balled up a fist and punched his father square in the jaw. The father took several steps back from the blow then grabbed his son and forcefully pulled him into his arms; restraining him with a bear hug and pleas for forgiveness.

The son screamed and cursed his father while struggle to break free. I was watching this and where I'd normally be searching my brain for ways to defuse the situation I found my emotions getting tangled in their web.

The son broke free and took another swing. Dad saw it coming and easily sidestepped it all while crying himself and still begging forgiveness. He grabbed his son again and when he tried to pull him into the bear hug the son countered by head butting him causing blood to immediately pour from the dad's nose.

I had to try to shake off my own feelings and intervene. Now I'm a woman, but not a waif. I'm almost 6 feet tall and far from a Kate Moss frame (no I'm not a huge fatty either). I rushed in and put myself between the two hoping the presence of a woman in the line of fire would at least halt the physical fight.

It did for a minute as the son turned his back on his father while declaring his hatred and how he wished his father had died instead of his dog. Strong words even for that situation. I lost control. For the first time since my first euthanasia I lost it.

I began to sob and I couldn't stop the tears from streaming down my face. The son turned and saw me standing their crying. He pushed past his father and without even knowing each other's names we embraced. It seemed like hours that we just hugged each other. As I gained more control over my emotions he continued to let his out, but in a healthier way then punching his dad. He buried his face in my shoulder and simply cried. His father sat on one of our benches and buried his face in his hands to do the same.

When neither of them had any more tears to cry they agreed to bring the dog home and bury him in the backyard. They worked together like 2 pall bearers to bring the body out on a litter and gently set him in the back of the still bloody Suburban. They didn't speak much, they just did what needed doing.

As they drive off and morning appointments (who were always late!) began to arrive and I simply stared out of the window watching the father follow his son down the road like the somber-est of funeral processions. The rest of the day was a blur. Even when we closed I still felt cloudy and sad and sat in my car crying for about 20 minutes after the last of the staff had left.

4-6 months later I see his face again. The young man who had shared a deeply personal embrace with me. He walked in all smiles and revealed a teeny Bengal kitten from under his coat. He could never replace his lifelong pal so he had gotten a kitten in his memory (his dog had loved playing with cats). I sat at my desk and smiled like a fool watching this young man cuddle and baby talk his new prize kitten and I never doubted for a moment that that kitten is still enjoying the most spoiled and loving life.

Osiris32,60,,106,1bag6d,,485,"I've posted this story before, but it's been about a year and this is the perfect sub for it.  Apologies for it's length, but it's a semi-complex tale that deserves detail.

I worked at a rather busy gas station in a quite rich neighborhood for several years.  I was the closing cashier (rich people near an Interstate think that a 24-hour gas station would bring in ""undesirables"") which actually gave me quite a bit of authority.  The Manager usually left around 4pm, and we were open until 10.  So for six glorious hours, I was king of my little domain, which was the convenience store, the 12 pumps, the parking lot, and the car wash (which will figure into this story).

It was a rather nice spring day, and nice days tend to mean that the car wash will be busy.  Rich people with nice cars want their nice cars to stay looking like nice cars.  I was inside, selling cigarettes and trying to keep the local bored teens from stealing beer when a nice car drives at a higher-than-normal speed up from the car wash, through the gas pumps, and parks in a fairly incongruous angle in front of the doors to the store.  Out jumps an older lady, somewhere in her late 60s, dressed like she was trying out for Meryl Streep's part in The Devil Wears Prada.  Kinda looked like Streep, too.  She marched toward the doors with a ""*this transgression shall not stand*"" look on her face.  I steeled myself, and put on the CS fake smile.

Sadly, it's been a few years since this happened, so I cannot quote the conversation verbatim, but the upshot was that she was QUITE displeased with how clean her car was after going through the car wash.  I apologized, and offered to run her through again for free, which was Standard Reply #1 for anyone having an issue with the car wash.  Ah, but that just won't do.  Okay, Standard Reply #2 was to offer to cut her into the head of the line, something we didn't like doing because it made all the other customers mad.  But that wouldn't do, either.  Standard Reply #3, refund the money.  Nope, that won't do, either.

I'm now perplexed.  What did she want me to do?  Which is what I asked her.  Instead of getting an idea of whatever it was that she wanted done told to me, I was instead impaled by a gale-force tirade about the quality of the store, the employees, our intelligence levels, why we found it necessary to hire high schoolers, and several choice coarse epithets that drew concerned and irritated looks from the two other women who were in the store with their children.

At this point, I realized that nothing was going to placate this harpy.  I again apologized, and offered to give her the card for the General Manager so she could talk to her.  Which the lady slapped out of my hand, but added that she wanted to know what *I* was going to do about this.  I responded with ""I don't know, ma'am, you haven't told me what you would like to happen.""  This, of course, set her off on another tirade, but I was now the full focal point of her anger.  The more general comments she'd made earlier were now very specific insults about my intelligence, my work ethic, and my value as a human being.  With several swear words thrown around quite a bit.

Now, another minor bit of back story.  There was a reason that, at 26, I was working at a gas station.  I was in school, working on my second degree.

In law enforcement.

Customer Service smile dropped away, and it was replaced with Authoritative and Stern.  Calmly, I told this ""lady"" (though she didn't fit any definition of the word I know, exception the biological one) that if she insisted on insulting me and the station, and swearing in front of customers and their children, then we didn't want her business any more, that she was to leave, and that any further contact would have to go through the GM.

I'll give you a moment to allow your imagination to come up with a suitable idea of her reaction.  I'll give you a hint, it wasn't unicorns and rainbows.

So now I went from calm to rather loudly commanding her to leave the premises or else I would be calling the police.  To which she seemed completely nonplussed, and continued to rant.  Now, being someone who's going into law enforcement, I don't bluff when I say I'm gonna call in backup.  So I made the call.  (Another bit of backstory, the local police LOVED our store, because we were one of the few places they could come get snacks at prior to graveyard shift, and we called in DUII drivers to them on a regular basis).

Five minutes later, here comes the black-and-white cavalry.  The officer, whom I'd had numerous official and unofficial interactions with, comes into the store.  I gave him the ""holy hell, this idiot REALLY needs to be smacked and tossed out of here"" look, and he gave me a ""what, the she-hag?  She's that much trouble?"" look back.  She then turned and lit into the officer about what happened, lying the whole time.  She said that I had threatened her, that I had used racial and sexual slurs, and that I hadn't actually gotten her car cleaned, which was *obviously* theft.  The officer turned and looked at me, to which I simply responded ""We have five cameras and a microphone in the store.  Everything has been recorded.  If you'd like, I can call the GM and have her come down here and show you the tapes, because that's not what happened at all.""

The officer escorted the lady outside, where another newly-arriving officer faced the same tongue-lashing.  The first officer then took my statement, and asked what I wanted to do.  I told him that she had to be off the property, and that she could talk to the GM in the morning, but I didn't want to deal with her ever again.  The officer smiled knowingly, and walked back outside.

What followed was the officer telling her that, no matter what may have transgressed, he could find no evidence of a crime, and that since I was an employee here and had told her to leave, she had to leave.  Period.

I'm kind of surprised that the lady's head didn't just explode right there due to high blood pressure.  She started screaming at the cop, almost incoherently.  I could understand words or phrases here and there, like ""never"" and ""treated"" and ""have your badge"" and ""fuck.""  But she wouldn't leave.  The officer, keeping his cool, asked her three separate times if she was willing to leave.  She wouldn't directly reply to the question, just kept screaming.

So he arrested her for criminal trespass.  She did not go quietly.  I applauded.

Now, this is where the REAL fun begins.  Because, as it turns out, her rage slowly turned into dawning realization as she was driven to jail, and she began to plead with the officers to be let go.  When they declined, she tried to name drop by stating that her husband was a circuit court judge for the very county we were in.

Which turned out to be true!

So it became a minor bit of local drama.  Since she was, in fact, married to a local judge, none of the other judges in the county could try her case due to conflict of interest.  Not just that county, but two others as well, seeing as how she was a social climber and therefore was heavily involved in social events, elections, political groups, and such.  She had to be tried in court almost 100 miles away.  She plead guilty, got a fine, and did 100 hours of community service (which, really, for that kind of trespass is a reasonable punishment).  Her husband, publicly quite humiliated, retired early and divorced her.  I never saw her again after the trial.  My boss gave me a raise for ""dealing well with a difficult situation"" and a paid day off.  I spent that day at the beach, eating ice cream.

TL;DR - Entitled she-devil tries to push around a wage slave, he gets her arrested and gets mint-chocolate chip in a waffle cone as a reward.

Brophages,89,,143,1gxxxx,,484,"Background: I work at a big box store that has two baby franchise food places inside it. The big box store basically allows a pizza place and a coffee shop to operate out of it, and in turn, the coffee place and pizza place kind of work like privately owned versions of the normal store. They can do most of the things a chain can, but we lack the ability to do things like issue cards or, in the pizza places' case, do special orders. Both of the food places are well known, national brands with at least three shops just within our city.

So today, I was running the coffee place by myself. This lady in a yellow shirt and big sunglasses comes up. She will be Yellow for the purposes of this story.

Yellow: mumblemumble

Me: I'm sorry, what was that?

Yellow: -gesture of annoyed shock, as in 'can you seriously not hear me?'- a [XL] sized [DRINK].

I can't really get into words the opinion she seemed to have of me. A lot of people who come into this type of coffee shop are super particular people used to dealing with the same baristas day in and day out somewhere else. They get really, really snippy and pissy if you ask them to slow down or repeat complex orders, and that was what she was doing. Anyways. I go to the menu to punch it in, but I find that we don't have it available in the XL. We have other drinks like it available in that size, but because of how she has modified it I simply can't ring it up in that size.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but I can only do [DRINK] in a L size. Is that alright?
Yellow: -more annoyed shock. Up your mental image from a bratty teen to someone who was just told a ridiculous story that ended with their car being soiled by a large dog- Uh, yes it is. I get that here all the time. Are you serious? They do that for me here every time I come in! What...?

She said all that rather quickly, and looked like she was prepared to continue. I interrupted, trying my best to stay cool, and tried to explain that whatever she'd had here before, I was physically unable to process her request. And honestly? If she had been a bit nicer about it I would have even considered doing it for her.

She settles for a large but makes a really big deal about it. Whatever. I remain polite throughout the remainder of our time together, and she even seemed to get a lot nicer the longer she was there. Not apologetic, just... Not as 'holier-than-thou'. I finished her drink and that was that, right?

Nope. A few minutes later she comes back with half the drink consumed and stands at the cash register. I'm on the other side of my little drink makey area doing something, and I looked up to address a customer next to her about what toppings -that- customer wanted on their drink. She immediately interrupted me and got between us.

Yellow: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm a VIP gold member at this store and I -trails off and kind of huffs and shrugs-. This just isn't acceptable, I would like you to refill this with-

At this point, she stopped and just kind of looked at me. As far as I know I didn't have a particular expression, but I must've let my 'you have to be kidding me' face show.

Yellow: ... Or just, just fill it up with ICE.

Me: Okay, let me get you some more ice.

*Moral:* Lady, we don't fucking have VIPs. We don't even -sell- or award the stupid card you have. Even if you visit us every single day and get that shit, I'm not going to risk my job for a jerk.

fascist_unicorn,48,,89,1cs9f3,,488,"So I was at a new location of a place of employment assisting them with setting up the store. They do not open for a while now, so the place is a CRAZY mess of pallets, boxes, no product out, and employees from various other locations in sweats and casual gear helping set up. Huge signs on the door reading ""GRAND OPENING ON (date)"", windows mostly covered in half rolled up signage/paper and incomplete, well, everything. The area this place is located is also newly developing and many other stores (including a different store next to us, a few in the center elsewhere) are not open for business. All the stores have large signs informing the populace of the opening date. You get it.

Anyway, due to the volume of employees entering/exiting, it's really hard to have the front locked constantly since we usually worked in waves all around the HUGE store. So we would have people stroll in and look around at the CHAOS, realize their mistake and leave.

This is not about those people. This is about the one who strolled in and was fucking ANGRY that we have nothing to sell them. Unfortunately, we also have brand reps who come in and set up their section. They're nice enough but resemble our customers a lot (don't know where their area is exactly and look around a bit) and it's too hard to check every one of them out each time. No product out so not too concerned about theft.

Well, Mrs. Bitchy Bitch-Bitch (as I shall call her) happened to pop in while we were all busting our collective asses in the back doing a trash run. I happen to go towards the front to retrieve a wayward pallet, when someone rudely shouts ""Uh, EXCYOOSE ME!!"" I look over and figure it's just a tired brand rep and say ""What's up?""

""What's UP? That's how you talk to people?? What's UP is that you have literally NOTHING for sale. What is 'UP' is that I drove all the way here and you have NOTHING for sale.""

""Uh.. We aren't open yet, pretty sure we aren't even listed yet, we don't open for a long time. We're setting up. The store will be open next month. Sorry for the confusion, please come back then and we will have plenty of products out. Sorry again.""

""Oh, of course, that's why nothing said that you weren't open out front, you all need to fix that.""

""The signs on the doors and windows say ""Coming Soon"" with our Grand Opening date, ma'am.""

""No, they *don't*.""

""Ma'am, this way, please. See these doors? The signs here say ""Grand Opening (date)."" Just check the door signs, a lot of places over here are just getting set up, like next door and (business) over there.""

Mrs. B B-B leaves in a huff. Whatevs, my hour's break in in like 5 minutes.

**FAST FORWARD A FEW MINUTES INTO MY BREAK.**

Outside, having a smoke, chilling in-between next door to other unopened store. Guess who comes walking back towards my store? Yep, Mrs. B B-B. Not clocked in for my break so I go into ignore mode with my headphones in just rockin' out. She walks past me, over to other closed store. She's halfway there when I turn to watch this unfold and take out my headphones. This store has merchandise being stocked so it's locked. She does.. not expect this. Pulls hard, door doesn't open. Pulls harder, then tries to push. Smacks the door with her hand when an employee of that store opens the door. Immediately tell employee is a SASSY Black Lady. ""Yeah, you here to set up?"" 

*""Uh, NO*, I was trying to *shop.""*

""We ain't open yet, sign's on the door."" *SLAM*

Mrs. B B-B starts cursing at the door, I guess S.B.L. probably didn't stick around to listen. Mrs. B B-B looks over, sees me.

""Oh, you probably thought that was HILARIOUS don't you? You'll think it's funny when I call your store when it opens and complain about your treatment of customers. Or I should just walk back in and tell your manager now, how about that?""

""Yeah, it was pretty *fucking* funny actually, since I told you about this. I don't work at this place, I just help set up the store, I'm off the clock now, you have no idea who I am, and you aren't a customer since we have nothing to sell, you're just an intruder at this point. The signs clearly say ""Authorized Personnel Only"" which obviously doesn't include you, so you trespassed and I was nice about it. I even warned you about other businesses being similar which I didn't have to do. Also, the signs are on EVERY FUCKING STORE'S DOORS. Learn to read. *Bye-bye now, go away*."" *wavy hand motion*

And with my conclusion, Mrs. B B-B duly made her escape to her car and left.

C08313458,75,,96,17ng27,,485,"Sorry for the wall of text. Just needed to get all of this off my chest.


Long time lurker, first time poster.


**BACKGROUND:** I work as a Box Office Assistant for a well-known theatre in the UK. We have 3 venues within the theatre and at least 5 shows a day (including stand-up comedy, straight theatre and musicals). Because of the amount and the diversity of the shows we get a lot of varying customers.


The way that a customer can collect their pre-paid tickets is simple. We ask *What show are you here for?*. Customer replies. We then ask *And what's your surname?*. Customer replies. We find their tickets in the box marked with the show name. The we ask *Can you please confirm your postcode..?*. Customer confirms the postcode. We hand over the tickets. They go enjoy their show. We get on with the rest of the waiting customers. Simples.


Except when apparently we are not seen as people...


I had one customer this evening that was just so rude and necessary that it made me question how some people get through a day treating other as they do.


I saw this guy walk up to the desk: Tall, skinny, around 25-28, visibly gay (you know the type) and he was eating a sandwich.


Now it's annoying enough when someone is eating at the desk, but most people have the common decency to stop when they are talking to you. This was not one of those people.


He approached the desk and shoved his credit card straight in my face while he was stuffing his face. I calmly made eye contact and asked what show he was here for. He once again just pushed his card in my face. I tried to look around it and asked again. He had finished his bite and so he very kindly answered me. So I asked him his surname, hoping I would be able to get it out of him before his next mouthful. Nope. He takes a large bite and once again thinks that his card is enough. So I clarify that I need him to confirm the surname that the tickets were booked under, as it can sometimes differ to the one on the card. He tells me, in the most condescending, rude manner that I nearly wanted to refuse him service, because it had been that kind of **week**. But I kept my calm and got his tickets. He then tries to grab them out of hand, but I manage to keep hold of them. I then ask him to confirm his post code.


The look he gave me was one of absolute shock and horror. It was like I was asking for his first born...


So I say *""You just need to confirm your postcode for security reasons""*. And he just looks at me. Leans in and says:


&gt; ""I'M EATING!""


Right in my face. Sandwich flies out of his mouth and hits my face. At this point my colleague [lets call him PC] who was manning the register beside me, shot up out of his seat and pushed the man back. I was just in total shock. This guy showed no guilt in what he had  done. Just took the tickets out of hand and walked away. I couldn't say anything. The other customers who were there (remember at least 5 shows on, so the foyer is constantly busy) just stood around agog at what they had just seen. 


A very kind lady came up and gave me a napkin to wipe my face. I was shaking at this point. PC radioed the DM who was there straight away. PC told her what had happened, as I was still shaken up, and gave a description of the man. She radioed for security (which we have because there is a public bar on the ground floor) and told them what happened.


The next thing I heard were shouts from the stairwell, along the lines of: ""You can't treat me like this!"" / ""I'm a paying customer"" / ""I haven't done anything wrong"". And then I saw him being escorted off the property, still eating his bloody sandwich.


And then he said those magic words: ""This isn't the end, I'm calling my lawyer""

To which the security man replied: ""Great, maybe he can explain what 'threatening behavior' and 'right to refuse entry' means"" and slams the door in his face.


I then went on my break and just about broke down.


I've had unpleasant customers in the past, which I can get into at another point, and I've had absolutely brilliant customers, but this is the first one that really affected me on a personal level. 


I don't know if I'm being stupid, but it's those kinds of people that make me loose hope in humanity...

Me: I can't accept your card then, sorry.

MC: You guys took it before. (Turns to his kid) lets go. 

Kid: Why?

MC: Cause they're assholes!


I know people don't always like carrying their wallets, but having an ID with your credit card seems like a no brainer.


Edit: Holy crap, right after posting this he came back. He had cash in hand which isn't uncommon after I refuse a card. After calling us assholes though, I planned on telling him to leave.

MC: Hey, sorry for how I acted. I work in customer service myself. Don't know what I was thinking. 

Me: uh.... Well thanks for apologizing. Don't worry about it, we all have bad days.

fatty_fatty,57,,122,1hla0u,,485,"This happened a couple years ago when I worked at a store that sold magazines, including all the awesome-st mature ones. That being said, porn gets stolen—a lot. Since it was one of my jobs to help reduce losses as well as stocking the new magazines I decided to start putting no-go's on the porn. On top of that, I would quickly count the ones on the shelf every week, and correct our inventory for missing ones (usually 5-10 a week). 
One night just after completing aforementioned task I leave to go home, but since I was hungry I decided to eat fresh across the street first. Well upon returning to pick up my car, I notice that there are several police cruisers parked to block the entrances. Intrigued, I go inside to see what the hubbub is about. Well I guess in the ten minutes or so that I was gone a group of four boys only 10-12 years old triggered the theft alarm. Two of them just ran, and two stayed behind. My manager was a wizard at convincing people that they should stay since we couldn't actually make them stay.
So the police are there, and we decide that they are just dumb kids so they shouldn't be charged. The police call the kids parents, and get the first two to give up the names of their accomplices. They are being very calm and professional (I for one don't much like the police). They tell the kids that they are going to not be in trouble this time, and how what they did was immoral and stuff like that. I was going to leave at this point, as it was really a boring and routine shoplifting procedure.
But, as I am leaving the office a lady comes in saying she is the mother of one of the two. She was way too calm about the whole thing. She asked if her kid was being arrested, not worryingly more like she was making a note of how much dinner she needed to cook. And when the officers say ""no"" she asks if they could anyway, just to teach him a lesson. The officers say they really cant if the store doesn't press charges, which we really didn't want to.
Anyway, enter mother #2. This lovely woman immediately starts yelling at the police for wrongfully detaining her child. To which they explain that the boys not only admitted to it, there was video evidence. They also mention that they are not arresting or charging him, so he is more or less free to go.  Well, she just refused to believe that her little angel would do such a thing. And instead of taking her child and leaving with dignity, she starts screaming all sorts of profanity at these 6 or 7 cops. We are not in the office at this point. we are on the sales floor at the entrance. And she is yelling about how she will sue everyone here, she even points at a few customers and threatens to sue them for I assume existing. 
At this point the manager asks her to leave with her child. To which she refuses. Conveniently the police were there, so they say she can leave on her own or they could remove her for us. Begrudgingly she leaves, still yelling. But only for a couple minutes. She came running back in throwing rocks, I shit you not ROCKS. The police were in the office, just chatting with the manager about something, when one of them shatters the window between the office and the floor. I rarely enjoy watching police arrest people, but my god did it feel good to see that woman pepper sprayed. 
As I was leaving for the final time that night the first overly calm mother looks at me and said, ""I always hated that bitch.""

hobbsarelie83,29,,67,19oyf9,,489,"So I have worked at the same grocery store for 5 years, unfortunately. A lot of people that come into my store are regular customers because it's a small town. I ALWAYS try and make sure my customers, who aren't dick bags, get 110% amazing customer service. There's a lady who is a stroke victim who frequently shops at our store. She's the nicest lady and everytime I'm working I'm her personal helper, which I don't mind. I've actually been doing this for the last 3 &amp; 1/2 years. She comes in, finds me, and I help her shop.

She always ask where I'm at when she comes in and is disappointed when I'm not there (from what my managers have told me).

""Was that your fiancee's grandfather that I saw in the paper?""

So i'm working at the register, blessed that most customers are nice and reasonable. megabitch walks over with an umbrella that costs $9.99 and the $10 off coupon. I had a similar situation the day before and the man understood and found something else. 

me: I'm really sorry, the coupon requires the item to be over ten dollars.

L: I'm sorry, the computer doesn't allow for this to go through.

megabitch: Are you the manager? 

L: I'm the floor supervisor...

ranranbolly,36,,96,1ikvv7,,474,"I currently work at a pretty major store, though I won't name it, suffice it to say you've probably shopped there if you're American. Before I was transferred to my current department, I used to work with items shipped to the store for customers. If they ordered it online, we'd receive it in the store and they'd just pick it up there, no shipping charges. A lot of times you'd get pretty curt customers, grabbing their items and leaving without much to say. We didn't have a lot of people, in fact, we only had one person working this area (myself.) Whenever we'd get gigantic items, I'd either have to be the one to load it up and take it out, or if I was lucky...I could find someone much larger and stronger to do it. A majority of the time, it was me.

Anyway, I had a guy come in one day to pick up his couch. These are the orders I would hate the most, obviously, because they're some of the heaviest. Someone helped me load it onto a cart, and I brought it out for the guy. He looked pretty grumpy by nature, with a sort of perpetual frown on his face. He was about in his mid-40s, early 50s, I'd say. When I brought the couch out, I asked if he'd need help loading it into his truck. Obviously he would, because most people generally do. In fact, most people don't even bother to help loading up their own heavy junk when an associate offers a helping hand. They'd rather stand by and watch. The guy sort of nodded, and said 'yes', really quickly. Then he pushed his grocery cart towards the end of the department, looked back at me, and yelled in a high-pitched voice 'FOLLOW..MEEEEEE!' He then skipped off. He'd been putting on the bad mood front the whole time, just so he could do that. It actually genuinely made me smile, and really made a pretty boring day legitimately awesome.

[deleted],61,,82,18azov,,476,"I have worked retail now for 25 years now.  I have gotten really good at pretending to be pleasant and ignoring other people's weaknesses and attitudes, but yesterday, I had a customer get to me. 

At my store, you have to have a military ID to shop there. People get around this by saying they are placing three orders (or whatever) and then have the person with the ID pay for all three orders. Now most of them are smart enough to understand that if you are placing three orders, you need to somehow separate the three different orders, so I know when to stop ringing. The black plastic bars found at the edge of most retail registers are particularly good at splitting up these orders, but if one is not skilled enough to know this, leaving a gap and telling me, ""Hey, this is where my order begins, so stop here."" Actually works.

Yesterday, I had someone who for some reason had never been to a retail store ever before and did not understand this concept and did not tell me when her order began.  I rang in half of her order before she started screaming at me that that was her order.  She actually said to me, ""How dare you ring my order with hers!!!!""  She kept on for a minute or two about how I was so stupid.

Normally, I would apologize and let it go, but yesterday I didn't want to be fucked with, so I looked at her and said, nicely in my best sugar coated condescending voice, ""I am not a mind reader."" I grabbed the bar on the side of the register and showed it to the lady, and said,""This is a separator bar. It is used to separate orders. You place it in between orders, so I can tell when your order begins and the next one ends. Now you know.""

She was really mad, but she just gave me a dirty look and shut the fuck up.

My supervisor holds in his laughter and handles it well. When trying to determine the necessary clean-up, he called the register and asked: ""How much puke is there?""

In July of that year, I was fired from the station.  This came about because I had been caught by corporate on my cell phone while at work (didn't matter that I was getting a call from my mom telling me that my Grandma, who was in hospice, had just slipped into a coma, and probably wouldn't make it through the weekend) and the manager had no choice but to send ol' Osiris a pink slip.  I don't look good in slips, and pink is SO last year.  Seriously, keep up with fashion trends!

Anyway, while I was no longer an employee, I was still there on a semi-regular basis.  Several of the co-workers were good friends of mine and lived in the area, and my grandmother (the other one, the one in a coma didn't make it through the weekend.  She was 104, and I miss her terribly) lived just a mile away.  So I was in the area visiting on a regular basis.  The station had good prices for gas and a decent beer selection, so I would stop in and chat.

As I turned on to the cul de sac, I realized that there was a news van in the parking lot of the station, it's antenna extended and what looked a lot like an interview being conducted in front of the store.  I thought to myself ""Self (for that is what I call myself), this isn't normal.""  I looked around, but couldn't see any police cars, firetrucks, ambulances, or other governmental/emergency vehicles that may provide a clue as to what's going on.  So I park, walk over to the corner of the store out of camera shot, light up a cigarette, and proceed to try and overhear what's going on.

The reporter, resplendent in his dark blue I'm-on-the-scene-of-a-human-interest-story blazer, was speaking to the camera about someone's generosity.  However, I didn't see anyone with him aside from the camera man and a rather bored-looking broadcast tech.  Strange.  Stubbing out my cancer stick, I walk into the store to see a couple of my old co-workers.  They are BEAMING.  Not that stupid forced customer service smile we've all had to shove onto our faces like a bad Dia de los Muertos mask, but real, honest smiles of joy.

""Okay guys, what's going on?  The news is here, and you're all smiling wider than when we got those surprise Christmas bonuses last year.""

One of the guys then explains what's been happening all day.  Early in the morning, a man came in and asked to speak with the manager.  They went back to the officer and talked for a short while, after which he came out with a happy smile and she (the manager) came out looking stunned.  The man then went outside and stood in the middle of the pumps, waiting for the next car to arrive.  As it drove up, he walked around to where the attendant was talking to the driver.  The man held up his hand to stop the conversation, pulled out a $100 bill from his pocket, and said, ""fill them up, it's on me.""

And he had been doing that, for ever person who came into the store.  All day long.  When I arrived he'd been doing it for about 11 hours.  He hadn't left once.

The station had become quite busy about an hour after the guy showed up, as people called their friends and family and told them to come get free gas.  Even in a town as affluent as that one, $4 a gallon isn't exactly cheap.  It had died down as the evening wore on, but the man was pointed out to me, still standing out there at the pumps, talking with one of the attendants.  I asked the cashier why.

Apparently, the guy had recently been given a rather large inheritance, one he didn't feel that he should keep.  So he decided that the best way to get rid of the money was to make a whole bunch of people very happy by filling their tanks.  Over and over and over.

The reception by the community was shock, then a little suspicion, then grateful thanks.  Many people had told him throughout the day how that rather small act for him had made their day or week so much easier.  Several people who had been emptying change jars just so they could have enough gas to get to work were suddenly looking at full tanks.  Tears were shed.  Lots of them.  The entire station staff was in the best mood I'd ever seen.  And, obviously, someone had tipped off the local news, because they were down there covering the story for the evening news.

Not everyone had taken him up on his offer.  A few had declined so that one more person other than them could get it.  A few standoffish people didn't want anyone thinking they were getting charity.  But the vast majority of people simply thanked the man and left the station, holding money they had expected to spend and smiling broadly.

I never found out how much the guy spent that day, but it had to be a lot.  Our average intake per day was well over $100,000, so it wasn't cheap for him at all.  I also don't know where he kept the money, since even in $100s that would mean a pretty damn thick stack of cash.  All I know is that it was a beautiful thing to do, that his name was Dave, and that for one day he made a lot of people happy.

PasswordIsntClop,79,,88,171wlv,,478,"At the store I worked at, there wasn't a line for returns. In fact, the person doing returns was also the only cashier. This worked about as well as you think it would: it didn't.

If a customer had a return, they would wait by the side of the register until the cashier had cleared the line, then if anyone had a return they would get serviced. If someone came along and wanted to check out during the return, they would have to call for back up. It sucked.

So, a black man comes into the store and needs to return something. No problem - I direct him towards the cashier, who has two people in line. He waits patiently for the cashier to finish, and once the line is empty, starts the return.

Not five seconds after she greets the customer and begin his return does a black woman come JOGGING down the aisle, waving her arms in the air at the cashier, screaming ""HEY HEY HEY"".

She gets up to the register and starts berating the cashier. She claims that the cashier had seen her coming, and because she was black, rushed to get the *other black person* there in front of her to *intentionally delay* her checking out... because she was black. That the cashier was racist and did not want to check out a black person, and proved it by doing a return for a *different* black person.

Absolutely mind boggling what her logic was. Long story short, the cashier thankfully did NOT say ""but he's black too!"" because I'm sure that would have caused a shitstorm. They called a manager, who opened a new lane and checked out the angry woman, and *didn't* give her any coupons. She complained and pitched quite a fit over the cashier being racist, but thankfully the manager clearly saw that it was bullshit and did not budge.","Well, since we're talking about customers pulling race cards...",566,talesFromRetail
CurvedStraightLine,85,,89,1f71l7,,479,"My last retail management job, I was getting out of my car when a guy grabbed my door and held it half open.  The wall blocked behind me, so he was effectively stopping me from being able to go anywhere.

""Give me your money!""  He said, aggressive voiced.
Without thinking I said ""no.""
""Give me a dollar?"" he responds, less aggressive.
I repeated no, and he looked downward and sad, then responded ""ok, ok"" and wandered off.

I rushed into work, only to find out that the same had happened to a coworker, only she gave him money.  We called the cops, and were told they were already on their way--someone else had called in the same issue.  

As soon as the cops arrived, blues flashing, several other people rushed out of the nearby grocery store.  This guy had tried to rob them also.  Altogether there were probably a dozen people freaking out, and it was devolving into a full scale panic.

Next thing you know, with a cop standing next to me, taking my statement beside the cop car, the guy comes right back to me and says again ""Give me your money.""  The cop immediately grabs the guy, who begins to bellow and yell incoherently in confusion.

I don't hear anything more about it for a few days, then I happen to look out over the parking lot and there's our friend, harrassing an old lady.  I call the cops again.

The cops take him away a second time, and one of them tells me that I should continue to call him in--but don't be surprised if someone tells me otherwise.

Later that day I get a call from a social worker, who says he heard I had an issue with Johnny.  Turns out Johnny isn't really all there and lives at a medical facility nearby.  Somehow, Johnny has found out that if he demands money, people will give it to him.  But I shouldn't think of it as unarmed robbery.  I should see it as ""aggressive panhandling"".

They were working on the issue, he said, but it would help if people would stop giving him money.  Doing so only reinforces the behavior!  It would be helpful to tell my customers just not to give any money to the large aggressive man demanding their wallet.  Did I have an email list or something to reach out to them?

I took his name and contact info, then called corporate.  Corporate, I have found, lives for this stuff.  They contacted attorneys against him, contacted the mall landlord, and we all got a memo that the guy was banned from mall property and we should call police if we even saw him (regardless of what he was doing).

Johnny was arrested over a dozen more times.  ",Aggressive Panhandling?,568,talesFromRetail
lokigodofchaos,69,,141,1nud0o,,470,"After I graduated college, I got a job at a big box home improvement store while I looked for jobs in my field. One day typical suburban mom (TSM) come in wanting to buy paint.  TSMs are generally clueless about the process of painting, so I make sure to guide them through the steps. She seemed pretty grateful for the help and was pleasant so far. Once we selected a color I asked her how many square feet she was painting to determine how many gallons she needed. She of course, didn't know so I asked her how tall her walls were, the estimated dimensions of the room and the number of windows and doors.
Me: Okay so with the room being 10 by 15 with 8 foot high ceilings you are looking at 400 square feet of painting surface. Minus doors and windows you can probably get away with a gallon of paint  per coat. 
TSM:Wow that was fast, you must be one of the ones that graduated.

I was shocked. Was this a compliment? She was implying that my fellow employees were all drop outs who couldn't do simply multiplication. Most of us in my department were college students or recent graduates. We worked there because the job market sucked and the hours were flexible for classes.

 I pretended it didn't phase me and politely upsold the hell out of her. Premium rollers and brushes she would probably only use once,  Frogtape (high end masking tape),and I mixed her paint in the more expensive line of paint.

isu1857,200,,210,1dc26j,,470,"I'm not really upset about the situation, just thought this might be interesting to share to all of you. We all know customers can be the worst people walking into your doors, but I was not expecting this yesterday.

Since it was Sunday, we were slammed around noon. I work at a large sporting goods store in the footwear department. I was busy helping customers, and there was only one other person scheduled to work in my department. 

I notice a guy and a girl sitting on a bench, holding [this Nike shoe](http://www.nikefree50store.com/images/50store/mens-nike-free-50-5-hyper-blue-tint-black-volt-neon.jpg).

I would have to say that 75% of the time when someone is holding a shoe, they are looking for me or one of my coworkers to get a size for them. Naturally, I ask if he needed help finding anything. We'll call him Offensive Customer.

Offensive Customer: Well, I was wondering if you had this shoe in a masculine color.

Me: (confused) Well, sir, blue is a traditionally masculine color that has marked the male gender for quite some time.

OC: Yeah... well it's not.

At this point, I stood there and stared for about 10 seconds, and since he didn't say anything else, another customer caught my attention and I excused myself. 

About 20 minutes later, the OC is standing by the giant wall of shoes with the girl and again, I decide to approach them because maybe he ""found a more masculine shoe"".

Me: Did you find anything that you would like to try?

OC: No, actually. Do you have any shoes that don't have queer colors?

Me: (in a state of shock, yet anger) Wow, that's offensive.

I walked away. I completely refused to help him anymore. While I was walking away, I heard, ""No it's not"", so I replied, ""Yeah, it is.""

I radioed over to one of my coworkers who was helping out our department from fitness and asked him if he could help out the customer. He didn't second guess the call I made, and I later told him what happened. To my surprise, the customer fed the same offensive line to him, and didn't respond. He just stood there silently until he decided to try on a shoe that was ""not queer"".

levirain,77,,108,1nnfjf,,469,"Up until recently, I worked at a fairly small Garden/Floral/Gift store in Minnesota. There are 7 of these stores, all of which are in Minnesota. Now I had been working at this store for about 4 years, so I know the ropes around this place. When we are short staffed, or no manager can be found, I act as supervisor/manager.


This story happened I wanna say sometime in Early October last year. The manager on Duty (MoD in this story) was actually the same one as in the [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1lt4ny/maybe_if_you_didnt_want_me_to_call_the_police_you/) story I posted. Now before I get into the story a little background on our return policy, since that is what this is about. For everything: with a receipt you have 90 days, with out is kind of up to us, but you only get store credit for the LOWEST price we have had it all year. Perennials, trees and shrubs: with a receipt you have 2 years we need the actual plant as well, with out is again really up to us but you get the LOWEST price we have sold it for in the last year. So if you bought an item at 29.99, tried to return it without a receipt and the item is now a sale item, you get the sale price back as store credit. Annuals and plants that wont survive MN winters are only warrantied for 90 days if you bought them April-September.


OK, story time. As I said, it is early October, probably second week in. I am the only cashier working in the hardgoods area(2/3 of the entire store). A lady comes in with what looks like 2 almost-dead rose bushes. I start my usual, ""Oh, have a return? I can help you here."" When she sets the plants down, I notice they are Hybrid Tea roses (not considered hardy in MN). I ask her if she has a receipt.


**C: ""No""**


Me:""Ok....well without a receipt all I can do is store credit at the lowest sales price we have sold them for""

October 1st our Hyrid Teas go down to $5 a piece, so, she is getting $10.

**C:""what...I bought these at 29.99 just a few days ago""**

Me:""Our hybrid roses have been $5 for two weeks now""

**C:""Well, I don't remember when I bought them...but I paid 29.99""**

Me:""I have no way of knowing if you got them during our sale or not without a receipt. Our policy is, without a receipt, lowest sale price""

**C:""Well that is just fucking ridiculous""**

Me:""I know, I am sorry, but that is the company policy""

**C:""Well then just let me fucking exchange them, the new ones *will* have the two year warranty.""**

Me:""After September we don't warranty any hybrid roses""

**C:""Are you fucking kidding me""**

Me:""Hybrid roses aren't Minnesota Hardy, they won't last our cold winters""

**C:""Then just fucking return them for the $60 I paid for them""**

Me:""Again, company policy is that you get the LOWEST price that we have sold them for in the year, it is against policy, but I will skip the $5 dollar price and give you 15.99 back for each since that is what they were all of September""

**C:""I remember what I fucking bought them for""**

Me:""Without a receipt, this is all I can do""

**C: get me a fucking manager if you are going to be so difficult""**

Great, MoD is a fucking kiss-ass to customers. Bends over backwards, doesn't stand up for her employees, and takes their crap. I just know this chick is going to get here way.

Me:""Alright, MoD is way out back, I will call her up but it may take a minute or two if you would like to sit down""

I call up MoD and while we are waiting I can her the customer on her phone bitching about how ridiculous I am being, and how I shouldn't be here alone because I am so incompetent.
Yea, fuck yourself lady, I offered to break policy for you, I am not getting written up because you couldn't keep a receipt.


A few more minutes pass and MoD still isn't up, the customer starts bitching about the wait. I re-page MoD and she tells me she got stopped but will be up when she can. One of the horticulturist happened to walk inside while I was siting at the counter with the roses. She came over and we were talking about them, and I explained everything to her. Hort is a sweet little old lady, love her to death, and she hates when customers are rude to workers.

Hort:""...Well that's to bad.""

Me:""Hopefully MoD says the same""

Hort:""...you know this rose have dirt caked on its branches don't you?""

Hort begins to tell me that she thinks the customer bought the rose over a year ago, wintered it over with the MN Tip method, but it didn't last the summer. So this plant may be EXTREMELY out of warranty. We double check the tag, since we print the year on them, and surprise, that part is missing. Hort runs off to tell MoD our findings.

MoD finally comes up with hort, asks me if what Hort said is true, and I agree. All three of us walk over to the customer.

MoD:""So you are wanting to return the two hybrid roses?""

Still on the phone **C:""Yes, but I want the price back that I paid for them, and apparently your cashier is to incompetent to do that for me""**

MoD:""Our policy is lowest sale price in the last year""

**C:""I didn't pay no $5 dollars for two roses""**

MoD:""I am sorry, but without...""

**C:""I shouldn't have to fucking keep my receipt, you should be able to just look it up""**

Hort:""Does -Big Box Store down the road- do that for you?""

**C:""I bet they would, since the appreciate *my* business""**

MoD:""ok, well...we aren't suppose to but I can offer you the second highest sales price of 15.99""

**C:""your cashier tried to pull that shit with me too. I paid 29 90 fucking 9 a piece for these, and I want that back""**

Without saying anything more, MoD nods her head. ""Ok"" she says. I am flabbergasted, this is the most I have seen her argue before, and she just gave up.

MoD:""just return them for the full price"" The customer smirked, like, full force smirk. I think thats where I had it.

Me:""You log in the register then, I am not breaking policy under my log in. LP guy would have my head, you are a manager, under your log in he would know someone ok'd it""

MoD:""...I can't have you ring under my name, its against policy""

Hort:""Fine then, do it yourself, this whole thing is against policy. LeviRain and I are going on break""

toxlab,96,,92,1gzb0c,,471,"This tale takes us back to my very first employment. Given the median age around here, this means that most of you were either crawling around pooping your diapers, or were still just a glint in the mailman's eye. As usual, I'll probably be verbose. TL;DR to follow...

I'm still all gung ho about customer service. In my teenage rubric, I know the secret of keeping customers happy, and everyone else must be doing it wrong. What's so hard about selling Big Macs?

And then I met my first intractable customer. We'll call him Bill.
Bill was probably around eighty. He walked with the careful, deliberate pace that comes from knowing that you're one broken hip away from being a terminal invalid. He apparently was supposed to have a walker, but refused to use it. The upshot of this was that you could see him coming from a mile away. As soon as he mounted the stairs outside, you had a good ten minute window before he made it to the counter. In future visits, I would spend that time getting everything prepared just right. But at this point, he is a stranger to me.

He makes his way to the empty counter at a glacial pace. The dining room was empty. It was a bit like watching someone traverse a minefield: one hesitant toe forward, transfer weight to the heel, slowly slide the other foot forward...I give him the standard spiel. Big grin, ""Welcome to McD..."" He cuts me off with a guttural grunt. 

""I'm sorry, sir?""  ""GRUNT"" I'm sorry, I cant understand you. Can you speak up?""

""ARBLEGARBLEBLARGHBA!"" This guy's got marbles in his mouth. I start to panic. What do I do here? Do I get a piece of paper and ask him to write it down? Point to the menu? I see my shift leader rounding the corner to the office. I call out to her. She looks up, sees him, and comes over.

""Bill"" she says, ""this is toxlab. He's new. He doesn't know you yet. He'll get your order, but you have to be nice."" She runs me through his order. Every day, he comes in and gets the same thing. Fish sandwich, cheapest thing on the menu. This entitles him to use a senior discount for a free small coffee. He wants a small water and two lemons. On the tray, not in the water. He takes two creams and three sugars. Three. Not four, Not two. Three. One plastic stirrer. And he wants three napkins. Placed on his tray, away from the lemons. 

This order nets the store the grand total of $1.03. And God help you if you get any of that wrong. 

At first, I pity him. I think, maybe he had a stroke. Maybe that's why he has trouble getting around and speaking. My shift leader says that's not the case. He's been a pain in the ass for a year now. He can speak perfectly fine. She knows this because he threw a temper tantrum in the lobby after a kid was being stupid near his table. The cops showed up, and all of a sudden he could speak just fine.

I found this out when the senior card program decided that card holders had to pay tax for their free drink. I had no idea until I rang him up and it came to $1.06.

HE. LOST. HIS. FUCKING. MIND.

He went ballistic. Suddenly I could understand every word out of his mouth. Most of them were insults to my mother. The word ""asshole"" got a lot of use too. Other customers around the restaurant are prairie dogging: Heads are popping up. I try to cut in. ""Sir, I...If you'll just let me...I'll get..."" Nothing. doesn't slow him down at all. A customer leaves the dining room to come to my aid. He engages Bill. Now they are both yelling. I am very confused. I turn and run to the back. My shift leader is doing inventory in the basement. I tell her what's happened. She sighs. She's too busy to deal with Bill today. Call the police. 

Okay, the cops. I can handle this. I babble into the phone, and return to the front. Surprisingly, Bill has quieted down some. The guy he was arguing with went from respectful but annoyed to flaming mad and ready to kick ass. I think Bill sensed he was getting close to having that hip break. He turned and made his way towards the door, like some foul mouthed tortoise. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Two days later, I'm back at my post. I see him approaching. Oh shit. The other cashier today is a trainee. Hey, she's gotta learn sometime, right? I didn't totally throw her under the bus. I told her everything I could in the three minutes it would take him to make it inside. Grab the tray, lemons, napkins. She gets the water. Ring in the sandwich. Don't pour the coffee yet, he'll say it's cold. Two creams, three sugars. He's getting close. Fish will be up right in time to ring him through. Out of sight. We got this. 

He makes it up to the counter. He gets the welcome. ""Hrmrmrm"". ""The regular today? Coming right up."" she turns and gets the fish. I stand nearby making happy meal boxes. Watching. Waiting for this to get bad. She totals. $1.06. No reaction. Thank God. Lemons far away from napkins. Good. She sets the coffee on the tray. He grabs it, takes the lid off, and throws it in her face. 

She drops to the floor, screaming. I yell the shift leader's name. I get a cup of water and start pouring it on the girl's face. Shift manager comes out. Sees us. Sees Bill holding his empty cup, looking at nothing. I tell her what happened. She vaults the counter, grabs Bill's shirt. He puts his arms up. She steps inside his hip, and judo tosses him to the floor. 911 is called. 

These many years later, I remember the girl was burned, but okay. I don't remember what exactly happened to Bill. I don't think he got jail time. I know he was never allowed in the restaurant again. And I know why he did what he did. 

He was upset because when she put the coffee on the tray, the lid wasn't secure and a drop of coffee got out and got on his napkins.

My boss was pretty accustomed to dealing with customers who believe they have the right to barter for everything. He had been there close to 10 years and did not barter with any of them. 

One day, a month or so after I started, a short, round man with a heavy, south-african accent walks in the door. ""Hello, my friends!"" he bellowed out to nobody in particular. The boss was handling a different customer so I had to go greet the man.

""How can I help you?"" I asked him. ""Well, my friend. I have a problem."" he replied. At this point I feel something bizarre is about to transpire, but wasn't sure what it was yet. ""Ok...?"". the response oozed out of my mouth with thinly veiled confusion. 

""I need a computer"" he says, then stares at my intently as though that was some secret code for something I was supposed to understand.

""Well, you've come to the right place. We have many computers."" I am sure at this point I had a half confused look on my face, my brow was probably starting to scrunch up like a dog would when it's master is making baby noises towards it.

""Well..."" he starts... ""I don't have any money."" 

I stood there, unable to respond for a minute. I tilted my head and leaned forward a bit, about to ask him the obvious question... ""How do you intend to buy a computer with no money?"" but instead as my body tilted forward, after what seemed like 5 minutes my bravery crumbled and I nodded then replied... ""Let me go get my boss...""

I go relay the conversation to my boss and head back to the service area. A short time later I hear a disgruntled sigh followed by ""Well I will take my business elsewhere!"". I peer around the corner to see the man storming out and my boss shaking his head in a dismissive fashion.

Apparently, the man believed he could take a computer home on the honor system, as long as he came in and paid for it when he felt like it... ""from time to time"" he said. When my boss explained that business in this country doesn't work that way, the man was genuinely offended. 

My boss just shrugged it off and said ""Get used to it, there are more where he came from..."" and there was. He was just the first of many facepalm inducing customers I had to deal with while I worked there.

As I'm giving up my search for the man, one of my friends who I hadn't seen in quite some time happened to enter our store. We had a quick chat and he told me some kind of amusing story (Cant remember what about, but it was enough to make me truly laugh out loud) 

A few minutes pass after my friend leaves, and I notice the man who was asking about the discounted headset earlier is now back in the store, browsing again. I grab the headset and head over to him. ""Hi, I couldn't find you before... but I checked with my manager and we can take X dollars off the price for you."" He looks at me with a death stare and says ""I saw you laughing at me, and I think it is disgraceful... I'm not buying anything from you"" 

Confused, I asked him what he was referring to. ""Before- I saw you with someone laughing about me and how I wanted a discount"" (Umm I'm pretty sure making fun of customers is not something we do in public view...) I realize he must have spotted me chatting with my friend. I just so happened to be holding the man's headset in my hands during the chat, so he's assumed we were both having fun at his expense. I apologize profusely and tell him its all a misunderstanding, I had no reason to make fun of him for trying to get a discount from us, etc...

SinNominae,111,,124,167zrp,,468,"At my job, which is a grocery store, Tuesdays are the day during which senior citizens get a 10% discount, so we get a lot of old people in on Tuesdays. Most of them are nice, patient, and quite friendly. But there are some who make me want to rip my hair out. Anyway, to my story.

Last Tuesday, I was waiting in the foyer (where they keep the carts) for my boyfriend to pick me up after work. It had been a LONG day...a lot of grouchy, rude customers who seemed like their only purpose for living was to be difficult and mean. So there I was, leaning against the windows and watching for my boyfriend's car...when I hear ""I need that cart!"" So, being naturally curious, I turn around.

A rather obese woman was standing in front of an old woman in the last motorized cart we had available. The woman had her walker in the basket and was shopping with her daughter. The old woman looked up at the obese bitch and said, ""Excuse me?""

Bitch: I said I need that cart! It's the last one, I need it!

Old lady: I'm sorry, but I need it. I cant'--

Bitch: Get up! You have a walker! You don't need this scooter! I do! 

The old lady paused and looked at her daughter, then back a the bitch: Why do you need this cart?

Bitch: I'm disabled! Now get up!

Old lady, sweetly smiling: I'm sorry, but as far as I know, being fat and lazy is not a disability.

Then she swerved around the obese bitch, laughing her ass off. Her daughter whispered, ""Mom! I can't believe you just said that!""

The few of us who saw it were laughing to no end. The obese lady turned red and ran (more like shuffled) back out to her car. 

**Tldr; Fatty tries to take last scooter from old lady, old lady tells her off.**

**EDIT** I forgot to note that I watched the obese lady run back to her vehicle--which was at the BACK of the parking lot, no where near a handicap spot, she wasn't limping or showing signs of breathing troubles.

[deleted],153,,186,1q7w5a,,473,"Mkay.

I have a lot of self-harm scars.

We're not talking hundreds, we're talking *thousands*.  Some more noticeable than others.

I work in a business where I'm lifting heavy equipment daily, so if I wear long-sleeves under my work uniform, I'll overheat  very quickly.  So, to spare myself the heat exhaustion, I just wear my regular short-sleeved uniform and pants.

I work with customers face-to-face and have to interact with them on a daily basis as well as help new employees with equipment from time to time.

Now, it's not *everyone* that writes me off as an angst-y young adult with issues, but I get at least one customer a day who just doesn't seem to understand that I have a soul.

One particular day, I wasn't in the best frame of mind and was just kind of clocking in the hours.  Typical and not a huge deal.

Well, a customer comes in and starts to joke around with me, saying things like ""Oh, I heard you had a lot of complaints today.  I'm going to speak with your manager.  ...just kidding!""

Now, I have a form of Asperger's that makes it hard for me to understand course joking sometimes, so I took every ""joke"" literally.

I tried to laugh it off after a few minutes, but then he goes off and says ""What is your problem anyway?  It's just a joke.""  

I casually explain that I don't understand those jokes all the time because I have autism and he goes and says ""Oh, yeah, I could see the likes of you having autism."" as he glared at my arms.

...Fuck you, dude.  Fuck you.

Then, another time, a woman came by and started to insult how I looked and dressed.

Now, I have long bangs that cover half of my face because I'm missing an eyebrow on my left side.  I don't do makeup on it, so I wear my hair this way to cover it up.

Our uniforms are black and grey with either black or kaki pants.  I don't wear kaki because I (knowing my tendencies to get hurt) would somehow get bloodstains on it or muss it up with dirt and grime.  So, I stick with black pants and a black shirt.  To dress it up, I wear wide, colorful wristbands and a rainbow lanyard.  

So, given my look, she goes off and starts to make fun of my hair.  ""Why do you wear your hair that way?  You don't even look like you have a face!  Get a haircut.  And why do you wear wristbands anyway?  Are you homosexual?""  

All very casually, like she was just talking about normal stuff.  I brush it off, because I get comments like that all the time.

*Then*, she leans into my ear and says ""You're going to rot in Hell.""

Out of the fucking blue.  What.  The.  Fuck.

I cannot comprehend people.  I really can't.

I was working the register one day about a year ago. It was slow so there wasn't much to do but obsessively clean the paperwork drawers and wipe down the counters. As I'm doing this I hear this kid start screaming, ""But I WANT IT!!"" and then the dreaded sound of of merchandise hitting the floor. ""DAD WOULD BUY IT FOR ME!!""

My manager comes out of the office to see what the commotion is all about and is just in time to see this mom dragging her daughter (maybe 10 or 12 years old) up to the front of the store.

Mom: (to the manager) Are you the store manager?

Manager: Uhh... No, I'm the Assistant Manager, how can I help you.

Mom: My daughter seems to think that destroying someone else's hard work is the way for her to get what she wants. Do you think that is acceptable? (she subtly shakes her head""no"" at the manager. My ASM catches on quickly)

Manager: No Ma'am I don't think that is acceptable at all. What do you think we should do about this?

Mom: Well I think that she should have to clean it all up and apologize to your employees , don't you?

Manager: Yes I think so. (She turns to the now mortified looking daughter and points to me) This is RedHeadedBug, she helped to build our displays. What do you think you should say to her?

Daughter:(ignoring my manager) MOM! I can't believe you are doing this! I want to go home! When dad hears about this he will make sure you never see me again.

Mom: If that is what you want, now what do you say to this young lady since you ruined all her hard work?

Daughter:(very grudgingly) I'm sorry I pushed everything off the shelf.

Mom:(To my manager) Now if it is okay and you have the time, could you help me oversee her while she fixes the shelf?

Manager: Of course. Thank you so much. 


My manager told me later that the mom told her she was going through a messy divorce and she was expecting some acting out from her daughter but she didn't want to encourage the behavior. She apologized over and over to my manager and thanked her for playing along. My manager gave her a 20% off coupon for the next time she came in for being so great. It's always great to see parents making their kids own up to their rotten behavior.

UptownShenanigans,90,,89,1kfn59,,469,"I work as a pharmacy tech, and I hate Mondays.

Not in a Garfield kind of way. No, it’s because on Mondays apparently everyone and their mother decides that this is the day they’re picking up their medication from my pharmacy. We’re talking over 300 prescriptions in the span of about 5 hours. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since it makes the time go by faster. However it gets grueling after awhile, especially when people begin to wear you down with their nonsense.

Well today was no different. I got off my break at around 5pm, which is the start of what I have dubbed the “afterwork pill brigade” - the long, long line of people going through our one drive-thru window on their way home from work. Well, right after I put my lab coat back on, it started and did not stop for 3 hours. 

Personally, I think drive-thru pharmacy is stupid. If things run smoothly, it’s great because I can get your info, snag your drugs, and get you on your way in less than 5 minutes. However, if one of the many things go wrong, it takes a long time to fix (if we even can), and we get in trouble if a person stays at the window for too long. And here is where my story starts.

About one hour into nonstop customers at drive-thru, a woman pulls up asking for her meds (now referred to as grumpy woman, or GW). Things start out normal. She’s a little crass at first, but this isn’t surprising. I get her name/birthday/address and type it into the computer. Bing! She has one ready in the waiting bin. The conversation goes like this:

Me: Ok Mrs. GW, you have one ready. Let me go ge-

GW: Wait, there should be two! That one and another, but I don’t remember the name.

Me: Ok do you remember what doctor prescribed it?

GW: It was Dr. Blah! She said she sent it yesterday.

It’s seriously annoying how often doctors don’t call in prescriptions when they tell their patients they did.

Me: Well I don’t see it, and I can’t contact your doctor since I don’t have any of her info. Would you like to just buy your one right now and call her tomorrow?

GW: No! I’m going to call her right now!

Me: Ok, but ma’am, you can’t stay at the window. There are people behind you, so you’ll need to either come inside or pull around to the back of the line.

GW: I’m not coming inside!

Me: Then please pull around.

She drives off a huff, and I help the next couple people in line. Well she pulls up again, but this time she’s on her cell phone. She thrusts the phone in my face and says,

GW: Here’s the doctor! Talk to her!

Me: Uhh sure. Hi this is Uptown, how can I help you?

MD: *annoyed* Ok so just refill Mrs. GW medication.

Me: But we don’t have an original prescription for it.

MD: Fine. Give her thirty of the 10 milligr-

Me: Actually, hang on, but I’m sorry. I cannot take prescriptions, only my pharmacist can.

MD: Fine, then hand the phone to the pharmacist.

Me: Again, I apologize, but you need to call the pharmacy line to give prescriptions over the phone.

GW overhears me saying this, and says,

GW: What?! Why can’t you just give my phone to the pharmacist?! I’ve done that before!

Me: Ma’am, I’ll get in serious trouble if I do that. *hand phone over to GW* Please just have your doctor call the pharmacy line. 

GW: Well fine, but I’m not leaving until it’s filled!

Me: Then you’ll have to either come inside or pull around since there are people behind you.

GW: UGH *drives away*

So, I’m not sure what’s about to happen. I do hear the phone ring, and I just continue helping the next people in line. But after a couple cars, GW pulls up again.

GW: Well is it ready yet?!

I go check, and sure enough, it is. Guess the guys filling saw how much crap I was getting that they did it quick

Me: Yep! *I was actually cheerful since I was happy to get rid of her* So that’ll be $50.

GW: WHAT?! Why is it so expensive?! 

Me: Well your first script is only $6, but the one you just filled is $44, and there is no cheaper generic.

GW: UGH! Fine, then just give me *similar, cheaper drug*

Me: Ma’am, we need a prescription for that. You’ll need to have your doctor call that in.

GW: I AM NOT CALLING MY DOCTOR BACK!

Me: Then, I apologize, but we can’t fill it. Do you still want the medication?

GW: NO IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE! JUST GIVE ME THE GENERIC!

Me: Ma’am I told you, there is no generic. This is the price. I don’t know what you want me to do.

GW: WELL I’M NOT LEAVING UNTIL ITS CHEAPER.

Me: *defeated* Ok one moment, let me get my pharmacist.

So I go up to the pharmacist who’s neck deep in work and explain what’s going on. I tell him that Mrs. GW refuses to leave until we give her a cheaper option. Yes, I told her that’s the price. Yes I told her there’s no generic. Yes I told her we need a new prescription for the other drug, and she refuses to call her doctor again.

So my pharmacist says, “Ok let me talk to her.” He pops up to the window and says, “Ma’am this is the price of the medication. There is no generic, and we need a new prescription if you want the other one. You can either buy it or not”

GW: *super cheerful* Ok! I’ll just buy the medication then. Thank you so much.

FUCK YOU!!! What the fuck was that?! You just gave me so much bullshit, were a huge dick to me, and now you’re totally fine with everything?! What. The. FUCK

And the worst part was after all this happened, all my colleagues said I should have just been assertive with her. Basically tell her that this is price and you can buy it or not. 

No, that’s not how that works. If I’m assertive, then the customer thinks I’m rude. If the customer thinks the tech is rude, she’ll complain to corporate. If corporate hears this then my pharmacist get in trouble. If the pharmacist gets in trouble, I get in even worse trouble.

This didn't happen to me, but my wife. Many years ago before she finished college, she used to work in a sandwich/coffee chain here in the UK called OOPS ""a large coffee/sandwich chain""  (who really pride themselves on top customer service).

FredFltStn,49,,236,1p6aku,,468,"When I was 17, I got my first real job as a delivery driver with a national red roofed pizza chain. The hours and pay were terrible, but I've always been an over achiever, so i worked hard and quickly rose to assistant manager. 


I was excited...until I figured out the promotion actually meant longer hours, more responsibility, and a set salary, rather than hourly pay. There were some weeks where I figured out i was actually making around $3.50/hour with all of the hours I was working. Still, I did my best, figuring at least I had a job.


The manager of my restaurant was two years older than I was. He had actually started as a driver at that very same restaurant. Apparently, he had knocked up one of the waitresses shortly after he had started, and after a shotgun wedding, they were happily married with a baby. The owner of the franchise had either felt sorry for him or taken a shine to him, either way, he had quickly risen to manager at the restaurant. 


I've seriously just spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to sum up this manager in writing. As an alternative, I'm simply going to list a series of adjectives that best describe him. Incompetent, sexist, thief, cheater, misogynist, liar, irrational, narcissistic, dimwitted, perverted, lazy, incompetent. I realize I listed incompetent twice, but one really didn't seem to do him justice.


Unfortunately, this gem of a manager drove away all but the most hard-core or insane help. shortly after they were hired. I would go to the trouble of interviewing and hiring help, only to have him quickly drive them away. My favorite was the waitress I hired who never even bothered to show up. She had been warned about the manager by a friend after I hired her, and was smart enough to abandon the job.


After six months of working split shifts &amp; 60-70 hours per week, I was ready to abandon the job as well, but I couldn't bring myself to quit. I had never quit a job before, and my 18-year-old brain decided it would be better to be fired then to quit. Unfortunately my manager knew that he was screwed without me, and I under estimated his resolve to keep me there.


For some reason, I felt loyal to the hourly employees, and I didn't want to just not show up for shifts and make their lives worse. In retrospect, I attribute this to Stockholm syndrome. Instead, I began to act out while I was working.


If a customer was rude or of obnoxious to my staff, I would tell him off and throw him out. If you complained about our delivery times, I would cordially tell you to order your god damn pizza from somebody else. If your children ran around the restaurant screaming, I would offer to have them muzzled. My incompetent manager thought all of these things WERE HILARIOUS!


One busy Friday night we ran out of clean plates, cups, and silverware. Normally, the drivers would wash dishes between runs, but of course they were out on deliveries, and the manager had no intention of washing dishes. As I'm standing in front of the dish sink trying to catch up, a stack of pizza pans falls over into the sink and drenches me. I am officially at the end of my rope.


While I am not proud of what happened next, I feel it is pertinent to the story, so I'm going to include it. I can only hope my mother never sees this.


I stripped off my wet clothes and continued to wash dishes, wearing only my shoes and an apron. The manager came back to get clean plates and saw me in my new dishwashing attire. He looked shocked for all of two seconds and then busted out laughing. The rest of the staff took turns coming back to see what was so funny. Thank God this was before the invention of camera phones.


I was officially a broken man. I figured that if this didn't get me fired, nothing would. I arranged to take a few days off, and one week later two friends and I left for a 3 day spring break vacation in Florida. All three of us desperately needed some time away.


On the day we arrived, we drove by the Disney casting center, where job interviews for potential Disney employees took place. On a whim, we pulled into the parking lot, went into the building, and all filled out applications.  After hours of waiting, we were all interviewed. I decided not to put ""naked dishwasher"" as part of my experience. 


24 years later, two of us are still employed by the Walt Disney Company. The third person eventually moved back home to get married to her high school sweetheart and raise a family.


I quit my pizza job from a pay phone in Florida after we had gotten the news that we were all hired at Disney. The pizza restaurant manager cried during the call. I never washed dishes naked at work again. ""At work"".

These two stories happened in the last 2 months and just show how easy it is for a table to stand out.

**STORY 1**

Family of 4 comes in, mom, dad and two kids somewhere between 5 and 10, boy and a girl. The kids were being annoying from the moment they sat down. I have 2 young cousins who I am very close with and I understand that it's difficult to keep them under control when one is doing something so exciting as going out to eat. But I felt like these parents were just enforcing the brattiness. They were whining and picky throughout the whole meal. They weren't doing anything wrong per se at first, just being annoying, but then later when I came out to clear their table it started. 

I dropped a little dish with dipping sauce in it (it was plastic, so luckily it didn't break. My hands were pretty full so I couldn't pick it up just then. The mom asked her son to pick it up for me. He gets up and walks over to the dish. Instead of picking it up, he KICKS it at me. Mom and Dad laugh ""oh kids... hahaha"", I say in a somewhat playful voice ""Well that wasn't very nice"", go inside to put the dishes I am holding away and come back to finish clearing up.

When I go back outside the kids are running around the patio, screaming. Parents aren't saying anything of course. I drop the check and finish clearing off the table. As I am about to leave the kids come back up to the table ""Mommy, mommy, look!!"". I look at their hands. They're covered in chalk. In dismay, I look over to the chalk board. One of our staff members goes to art school and is extremely talented. She does an amazing job at designing our chalk boards. This one has a really nice picture of assorted fruits and was advertising our smoothies. 

Well, *had*. The kids had wiped away the the picture, leaving a mess of little finger prints everywhere. ""Ooooops, hahaha, sorry about that"" laugh mom and dad. And they didn't even tip me well after all of that.

**STORY 2**

This just happened last night. A family of three sat down, mom, dad and their little boy, probably around 8 or 9. I bring them their waters and ask if they would like anything else to drink. The little angel asks me ""miss, what kind of sodas do you have?"" After I go through the list he asks in the sweetest little voice ever ""May I please have a Sprite?"". My ovaries just jumped, I don't even have kids and I was about to cry cause the way he asked was so sweet. 

I bring them their drinks and take their food orders. Later in the night when I come to clear the table he says ""Excuse me Miss, can I ask you a question?"" He then proceeds to ask me how many Red Sox games I've been to and then tells me that his parents just told him that the reason they are in Boston tonight is to go to the game, and it's his first World Series game ever. His parents had told them they were going to pick up something at a store, and surprised him during dinner with the tickets. 

As they were leaving the restaurant he comes up to me (I was at another table taking their order at the time) ""Excuse me Miss, have a wonderful night!"" The other table and I can't stop ""d'aaaawwwwww""-ing. That sweet little angel deserves to go to every Red Sox game.

DiggerNick9,57,,88,18j7fi,,470,"So around this time a few years back, I was working in a small store that used videogames/movies/cds/game systems. We had just done some remodeling after taking over the neighboring space so there were still walls with no paint on them, exposed wires and piping, etc.  There also has been no heating in the back of the store for the past few days due to the construction. I normally wear a hoodie so I don't notice it at all.

After a few hours of being open an older woman came into the store and asked for the bathroom key after looking for a few movies. I took her stack of movies to put off to the side, gave her the key, and pointed her in the direction of the bathroom. Minutes later I see her marching past the aisles towards me with this face filled with fury.

""Gah, Have you people ever heard of heat!?"" she exclaims after slamming the bathroom key on the counter in front of us.

Oblivious at the moment as to why she's upset about heat, I look at her confused and reply, ""You mean the Val Kilmer/Al Pacino/Robert De Niro movie? Yes, we have a coupl-""

**Background** Working at the children's circulation desk was by far my favorite desk. I got to read the kids books that were returned, less foot traffic and I got to experience some of my favorite conversations and kid quotes ever! Below are the highlights of either conversations I've had with kids or things they said while running past my desk. All names have been changed.


African drums are being played in the children's room for an African Heritage Celebration. Lots of kids dancing and learning about Africa, it was cool. A boy and his mom are checking out books at my desk...

**Boy** *Mama, are we from Africa?*

**Mom** *No, sweetie our family is from Germany.*

**Boy** he gets a thoughtful look on his face then says *If I get REAL tan this summer then can I be from Africa?!*

His mom smiled and took his hand to go get some books to help explain heritage.

**Random quotes**

Kid says to me *You have HUGE boobies! When Ima big girl I'll have them too*

*But daddy! The fish dared me to do it!* (I still wish I knew what that one was about!)

Kid says to me, clearly pleased with himself *My poo was green today!* 

**Me** *Well that's quite a feat!* We fist bumped.

Kid asks me *Are you pregnant?*

Kid holds up a scratch and sniff book *Can I eat this?*

*Gra'ma if there are giant space bugs, do you think Buzz Lightyear will stop them before they eat us?*

Girl hold up a Disney book *Which Princess is your favorite?*

**ME** *Ariel*

**Girl** *I don't like her, I bet she smells like fishes poop....*

*Mom! I put my nose on his [baby brother's] butt and he smells like farts!* (This I actually got to see happen and I nearly fell out of my chair when he yelled it at top volume)


Girl named Annie walks up to my desk. I've seen her in with her dad the entire summer. Since he teaches and is off all summer they basically lived in the library. Now she's with a woman who I assume is her mom since school is back in session.

**ME** *Hey Annie!*

**Annie** *Hi, Miss Library* (most kids called us Library, using it like our names)

**Me** *Is this your mom?* 

**Annie** *Yep! My mommy's a prostitutor!*

I look at her mom with a grin.

**A's mom** *She mean prosecutor. I work at the court house.*


And now for my favorite conversation with a kid ever!

8 year old girl comes to my desk with a stack of probably every dino book in the place, including the Zoobooks. She hands me her card with a smile.

**Girl** *What's your favorite Dinosaur?!*

**Me** *If we're talking herbivores, the Brachiosaurus. Carnivores? The Raptor or the Allosaurus for sure. how about you?*

**Girl** *The T-Rex, because of his awesome teeth! I feel bad for him though, he's got little arms...Have you ever seen Jurassic Park?*

**Me** *Heck yeah, I love that movie! You're favorite part is the T-Rex scene isn't it?*

**Girl** *Sort of, I love it when the guy gets eaten off the toilet! The Raptors gave me nightmares though, so mom won't let me watch The Lost World or the third one.* She looked so sad.

**Me** *Yeah, I had nightmares too when I first saw it. I was even younger than you! You know the best way to feel better? Pretend Dr. Grant is there helping you fight them off, worked for me every time.*

Her mom had been intently listening this entire time and seemed so happy with my response she piped in...

**Mom** *Honey, if what the librarian suggests works maybe we can try watching the Lost World together. What do you say?*

The girl got so excited she hugged me over the counter, grabbed her books and ran out the door with her mom to go re-watch the first movie and see if she got scared. I found out a month or so later that she was no longer having nightmares and was watching every dino movie or special she could get her hands on. I'd never felt so happy to have accidentally helped a child get over a fear I had had as well.

TL;DR: Lots of weird questions and comments heard from kids in passing and making a connection with a girl over dinosaur interests and fears.

maryjaneshoes,60,,109,1neh7x,,464,"I am in high school and needed some cash, so I decided to apply at a store which is famous for making sure their customers ""never pay more for fabulous"". 

Well, I was in training and it was my first day on registers. I started off the night with a coworker training me, but of course, just as she went on her 15 minute break and left me to fend for myself, a woman walks (trips) up to the register with a cart literally so full that things were piled up to her head.

She smelled like urine and cigarettes and began slurring her words from the second she started putting an obscene number of gym shorts all over the counter. She took a look at my ""In Training"" sticker on my name tag and her face lit up like she'd hit the jackpot.

But just because I'm a 17 year old girl with an ""In Training"" sticker on my name tag, does not mean that I'm a *fucking idiot*.

She starts off by making intense conversation with me, which, to be honest, distracted me... which I could tell was her intention. I was finding it hard to remember if I had already rung up that pair of shorts, or was it this one? and I was getting overwhelmed by the pile of things growing on my counter and the line forming behind this woman who was clearly intoxicated.

Then, I noticed something. She had put red clearance stickers on items over their barcodes to lower the prices. I kept my poker face and scanned a picture frame that had been ""marked down"" to $3. I looked at the screen and saw that the sticker was intended for a juniors' tank top. 

I decided to say something, and shit hit the fan.

Me: ""Excuse me, ma'am, but it looks like this sticker is for a tank top - not a picture frame, so unfortunately I'll have to charge you the actual ticket price which is $19.99. Would you still like the frame?""

CB (Crazy Bitch): ""What? Are you saying I switched the tickets? I'm not a fucking thief.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I meant no disrespect. I don't think you're a thief, I'm sure this was an honest mistake. Would you like the picture frame?""

CB: ""No, not if you're not going to honor the price I thought it was."" 

Me: ""Okay.""

So I go back to scanning the next item, which, miraculously, ALSO has the wrong clearance ticket on it. Hmm, and so does the next one, and the next. And looking back on my screen, I didn't remember ringing up any candles, or kitchen supplies. 

Me: ""Ma'am, it looks like most of your items have been misticketed. I'm in training so I really don't know how to handle this. I'm so sorry. I have to call my manager down here, so could you wait just a second for him?""

CB: ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'M NOT FUCKING STEALING.""

She goes into a fit of obsceneties and gets so worked up that she vomits on the floor. I'm in shock, and so are the people in line behind her. And it looked like CB would be in shock if she was capable of forming actual thoughts.

She looks at me and runs out of the store, setting off alarms as she leaves the door. My manager, who had been walking past as she vomited and ran, chased her outside as she was getting into her car. He then called the police who came and she was arrested for public intoxication, and my store is currently pressing charges on her for the sunglasses she tried to smuggle out with her. 

I guess you could say it was the best training I could have possibly gotten on registers that night. I don't foresee anything crazier than that happening (fingers crossed?)

I did end up having to mop up the puke, which is absolute bullshit if ya ask me, but yeah. Thats my tale from retail.

TL;DR: Crazy drunk bitch tries to switch ticket prices, I confront her, she gets very upset and ends up throwing up, running out and taking a pair of sunglasses with her, is arrested for public intoxication and my store is pressing shoplifting charges against her. Also, I cleaned up the puke. 

**Obligatory Front Page of TFR Edit: Thank you guys so much for the overwhelmingly pleasant response, this is why I love Reddit. For the record, I left my job literally the other day and that's why I'm choosing to tell this story now. But anyways, thank you all for making me laugh in the comments. You cheered me up after a shitty (for unrelated reasons) day!**",Woman throws up everywhere after being caught switching markdown ticket prices,573,talesFromRetail
madgreek70,88,,114,1am5dj,,470,"I use to work retail at a very large store. I usually worked in the back, which meant I did not have to wear the store uniform. One day another worker and I helped a customer put a TV into her car. As we were walking in the store a lady came up and asked if we worked here. We replied yes. She then told us how here son would constantly wounder off away from her, and she would loose track were he was. She then pointed her son out who was playing with some clothes in the clothing department. Meanwhile I was standing there wondering to myself ""OK so you cant keep an eye on your kid, and please don't ask me to babysit."" She kept talking about how he doesn't listen, and blah, blah.
She then asked us something that to this day, I cannot believe a competent parent will ask a complete stranger this question. ""Can you go up to my son, grab, him and take him out of the store and pretend you are going to take him away?"" When she asked this I can swear my jaw hit the floor! My and my coworkers reaction was, ""Are you fucken serious?""
She then said to act mean and scary, and she will be watching he whole time and waiting outside the store doors. She wanted to scare her son, into not wondering off, and that bad thing might happen if he does. I then replied again, ""Are you fucken serious?""
We told her no, we are not going to pretend to kidnap your child. It is just completely wrong, and so many horrible things can happen. We also told her maybe you should keep a better eye on your son, it is your kid and you need to be looking after him. When we told her this, she then became very upset yelling profanities and, asked for a manger. Apparently she did not like that two young ""punks"" were trying to tell her how to raise her kid, and that we used profanity at her. She even told our manager that we refused to help her in teaching her son a lesson by kidnapping him, and this was not customer satisfaction. At this point my manger also replied ""Are you fucken serious?"" and then with a ""Get the hell out of here, before I call child protection services!""
She then argued more, when she was done we had to find her kid because he disappeared again. When we did find him, she left and yelled some profanity on the way out. My manger came over and said to us and we could not stop laughing at what just happened. ",No I will not kidnap your child!,584,talesFromRetail
gh0uls,27,,83,1icptf,,463,"I used to work as a bag boy/cart pusher for a large chain grocery store, and we'd get shoplifted from all the time. Mostly teenagers stealing bottles of liquor, and most of the time they'd get away with it. Once in a while people would attempt a bigger heist with a cart full of groceries, but those were rare.

 My favorite story about shoplifting happened one Friday night at work. It was pretty slow in the store and I was outside on my 15 minute break shooting the shit with a coworker. We're standing out in front of the entrance when we see two girls, probably in the 18-20 age range, hustling from the store with a couple bottles of liquor. Usually when this happens they are heading to a car to drive off immediately. Not these geniuses. They get into a car, in plain sight of me and my coworker, and sit in the backseat presumably waiting for one of their accomplices to return from god knows where. 

My manager comes strolling out about 30 seconds after them and says, not expecting us to be of any help, ""Hey, did you see where those girls went? They stole some alcohol."" 

My coworker and I shrug and point at the car they are sitting in, about 40 feet away from us. My manager gives us a look like ""Seriously?"" and walks over to the car. We watch the scene from a distance: he knocks on the window, berates them for a minute, snatches the bottles back and tells them never to come back to the store. The girls are bawling. My manager walks back into the store muttering ""dumbasses"" under his breath.

gurrl,88,,92,1iauok,,461,"Alright, like I said in my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1i9x8t/the_one_where_i_am_reminded_how_far_i_have_come/), I work in an extremely male-dominated environment. Totally fine by me.

Except for when the customers insist that I am a weakling or not fit. 

I am about 5'8"" and on the thinner side, but I've got some serious guns going on. I could probably kill an elephant with my thighs [note: this may be a bit of an over-exaggeration]. I love being physical on the job and getting the chance to get a workout in when I have the chance, ex: stocking shelves with heavy items, loading up hundred of pounds of rocks, etc. 

Several times I have offered to assist customers in loading items either on the dollies or into their cars. Many times, however, I am flat out refused. I am told that, as a woman, I just simply cannot deal with such laborious tasks. I usually just crack them a mischievous smile, ask them what they needed to load and proceed to do it myself. For some reason, most end getting a kick out of it.

One small incident stands out in my mind, however. It was a busy afternoon at the store, with tons of customers checking out. The regular lot guys/loaders were slammed with duties at the other end of the store. I walked up to a distressed-looking man who had about 600lbs. of pebbles in about 12 plastic bags. I proceed to ask if I can help him, and he proceeds to look me up and down, exclaiming, ""You can't do th-"" As he is saying this, another man turns around and interjects, ""Naw man, you need to get this [male coworker of mine]. *He* will get the job done, but you have to wait a few minutes. I mean, not that you can't or anything, *sweetie*."" 

I give the interjecting man (IM) a look, and turn back to the original customer (OC), ""Seriously, sir, I am fully capable of loading this into your vehicle. I reallly love the workout."" And I grin that fake customer-service smile that we all know so well.

OC&gt; Are you sure you can do this?

IM&gt; Trust me, man. The [male coworker] will do so much better. He's still working on mine, but...

Me&gt; I am still wonderfully and fully capable of doing this, we could be done in a moment, and you won't have to stand around and wait. May I ask where your car is parked?

Unsure, the OC points me to a large SUV outside. I start towards his car, when IM emits his final word, ""Alright man, don't say I didn't told you so...""

It took me all of two minutes to load the pebbles onto the vehicle. I turned around, asked for the customer's name, shook his hand, smiled, and said, ""Thank you for shopping at [my place of employment]. Have a wonderful day.""

bagelpusher,59,,111,1ggwju,,465,"So I work at a department store that has a deli. We have a bit of downtime, so I decide to organize our meats. As I'm doing this, I notice we don't have an open black forest ham. People buy that shit all the time, so I figure I'm going to take some initiative and have it ready to go for when someone asks for some. I weigh it, take it out of the package, put it on the slicer, and set it to a 10 so I can cut the butt off.

Up until now, I had been pretty cocky about the safety of the slicers. You really have to try to cut yourself while catching the meat. That's the thing. I wasn't catching the meat when it got me. After I caught the butt and disposed of it, I reached for the ham to wrap it up with its date and all that, which is when it happened. I never bother turning off the slicers because they're on a really short timer anyway, so it's usually a waste of time worrying about it. At a 10 setting, though, I really should've fucking turned it off.

So I'm bleeding profusely from my knuckle, and they take me to the back to clean it up and call for my manager. Somehow, one of my coworkers doesn't hear me shouting profanities about how I had just cut myself and decides to give a customer a sample. Using the same slicer I just cut myself with. The exact fucking one. The customer eats the sample containing traces of me and decides to order a whole pound of the stuff. After my coworker cuts it up and hands it to them, someone informs him of what happened. I can only assume how wide his eyes went, as I was still in the back, but after finding this out he runs out and stops the customer and demands that they return it. I smell a lawsuit.

Anyway, at this point I've been sent to the back of the entire store (not just the back of the deli area) to fill out some paperwork. While I'm waiting for my manager to come back to take me to the hospital, I overhear one of the janitors talking to one of his buddies. Apparently, as I was dealing with my hand, he had been cleaning one of the restrooms. It was blockaded and everything when an older employee jumps the blockade, shoves the janitor out of the way, and proceeds to shit all over the floor in one of the stalls, just barely missing the toilet.

lululiya,49,,86,1dvea1,,460,"I work at a store that sells body jewelry. Some of it is hypo-allergenic, some of it really isn't and contains nickel which some people react very poorly to.

So one day this 20-something guy comes in and right off the hop he's acting like a total prick. He snapped his fingers at me and pointed down in front of him to get me to come over, like I was a dog. So I go over with a smile on my face and ask what I can get for him.

He says he wants a new lip ring, but it needs to be black. I showed him the black lip rings but warned him that they weren't hypo-allergenic, so if he has any problems with nickel he should opt for one of the titanium ones instead. He looks in the case with titanium lip rings and rolls his eyes.

""I said I wanted black. There aren't any black ones in there, are there? Do you even listen? Why are you trying to sell me something I clearly don't want?""

To which I reply, ""Oh no, I'm not. I'm just warning you that if you are prone to reactions then I wouldn't buy the black ones.""

He goes off on me and demands to see my manager. My manager is not in the store. So he tells me he's disgusted and sick of pushy sales-people trying to convince him to buy things he didn't ask for. Calls me a stupid little girl, wonders aloud how I managed to get a job working with people in the first place, etc.

So I ring him up and he leaves. A little over a week later he comes back with a swollen, red lip. He screams at me and my manager that I sold him non hypo-allergenic jewelry when he explicitly told me that he needed titanium. He demands a full refund.

Luckily I had told my manager as soon as she returned from her lunch the previous time all about that asshole. So she told him that hell no, he would not get a refund. She told him she doesn't allow her employees to be harassed at work and that no one from her store will ever serve him again.

So he left, taking his shitty attitude and grostesquely swollen face with him.",(x-post from r/pettyrevenge) Well deserved lip infection.,546,talesFromRetail

SheepdogCabbie,27,,114,1lzfp8,,460,"Hello again! Unlike my [previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ln16v/family_man_breaking_a_little_bad/) [stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1lmtha/no_you_dont_get_free_stuff_for_returning_items/), this one isn't from my grocery store days. This happened at my current job as a taxi driver last february. It was a VERY cold night, about -25 degrees celcius. This is important later. It was a saturday night, and everything was usual enough. Most of the people were drunk and happy, some were going home from work, just the usual crowd really. Until this happened.

At around 1 am this maybe 50-years old lady got in my cab. She was pretty thin, and something about her appearance seemed a bit off. Not threatening or junkie-ish, but just a bit weird. I didn't really think anything of it at this point. She was dressed nicely, so I didn't even bother to ask if she had money even though her destination was about 40 km (~25 miles) away.

She told me that she had been out with some friends that she hadn't seen in a long time. She had had a good night. The usual cabbie-customer smalltalk. Pretty soon she started talking to herself. I didn't always hear what she was saying, so I would ask her to repeat herself. As I figured out that she's not talking to me, I just ignored her. At this point I started thinking that she may be on some drugs (prescription or otherwise).

We were well on our way, about halfway there when I asked her what exit does she want to take off the highway. It didn't really matter, one way was a few minutes faster and the other maybe 2 kilometers shorter, so it's just a question of preference. She told me to take the second one. Good enough. The shit hit the fan when we passed the first exit that we could've taken.

&gt; Crazy Lady: ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING! YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN THAT EXIT! TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW!""

&gt; Me: ""Ma'am, you told me to take the second exit. I can't turn around, since we're on a highway and there's a fence between the lanes. We can take the next exit just as well.""

&gt; CL: ""WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHERE WE ARE DO YOU? TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW!!!""

&gt; Me: ""No, I can not turn the car around here! We'll take the next exit, please stop yelling.""

&gt; CL: &lt;Some more yelling and all around shit-flipping&gt;

And this is where this got really serious. She was sitting on the back seat, on the other side from me. She grabbed my right hand sleeve and pulled. Luckily I had both hands on the steering wheel and didn't lose control, but I slammed on the brakes after checking that nobody is right behind me. I was done being polite by now. I turned around and told her in no uncertain terms that yelling and cursing is one thing, but touching me when I'm driving is another. I wasn't telling her to get out (-25 degrees, remember?), but I did tell her that if she does that again I'm throwing her out. She apparently had had enough of my warm Mercedes, and decided to leave on her own. In the middle of the highway, at 1 am, on foot.

As soon as she got out I locked the doors, put on the emergency blinker and called the cops. I told them what happened and where I am, and started driving about 10 meters behind the lady as she started walking. Funnily enough, she walked the way where I was driving, so she didn't even turn around to walk the way she wanted to go so bad... At one point she realized it's freezing out there, and came by the door and gestured me to let her in. I opened the window just a bit, and told her that she's not coming in my car again and that I've called the cops. She asked me to at least let her have her hat and gloves. I checked the back seat, and sure enough they were there. I threw them out of the window for her so she wouldn't freeze to death while we wait for the cops.

After maybe 15 minutes of me frantically flashing my brakelights to passing vehicles to warn them of 1) me driving walking speed on the highway and 2) this crazy lady actually WALKING on the highway, we got to the second ramp that we were supposed to take. When we were on top of the ramp the police arrived. Not just one patrol either, but three! Slow night for them I guess.

When the police talked to her she seemed genuinely remorseful and lucid. I was actually thinking that the cops think that I'm the bad guy here, since she put on the act so well. I told them that 10 minutes ago she was completely different. She agreed to pay me for the whole trip, and asked me if I would take her the rest of the way. I told her no, and she totally understood and apologized some more. The police told her that they could take her home

After she had paid me (by credit card, so the officer didn't actually see if the payment went through), the officer asked me if everything was good and paid for. I told him yes. And now she went batshit insane again. She started yelling at the officer for asking such mundane questions. ""OF COURSE THE PAYMENT WENT THROUGH! YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY?!"" etc. All around berating and cursing. The cop tried to calm her down, but in protest she threw her wallet with full force into the dark forest with a meter of untouched snow laying there. The officer told her that she wouldn't be going home tonight and escorted her to the patrol car. I'm guessing the poor guys went searching for her wallet in the snow after I thanked them and went on my way.

FletcherPratt,67,,106,1df3i1,,459,"This is random and happened years ago but it still bothers me a bit. I worked for a long time for a grocery store chain. This is about when I was  a lowly assistant manager. On this occasion I was working at store in a downtown area that had been gentrified. The building the store was in used to be something else so it's layout was unique. 

One busy afternoon I got called up front to ""help a customer"" which was always a code for a ~~compliant~~ complaint.  I straightened my god awful company tie and headed up front. The customer in question was a conservatively dressed older women (CDOW).

CDOW: How many handicapped parking spots do you have?

ME: I'm not sure ma'am (looking out the window  into the parking lot) about 6 I think. I see there are some empty ones.

CDOW: You have eight. Why do you have so many?

ME: Well I know we are required to have a certain number but I don't know what that number is.

CDOW: You are required to have 8?

ME: I'm not sure.  Probably.

CDOW: Are you the manager? Why don't you know? (at this point she wanted me to understand that I was scum of the earth and likely an impostor)

Me: (This flipped my switch from ""bend over backwards"" mode to ""say whatever to get this bitch out of my face"" mode.) Assistant Manager and it has never come up before.

CDOW: I come to this store every day and I spend a lot of money here. I can never find a parking space because your parking lot is too small and you're wasting all that space on empty handicapped parking spaces.

ME: Yes the parking lot is small, but you know this building used to be a *major old school department store* and so when we turned it into the grocery store the parking lot was already in place. One of the costs of being in such a neat area, I guess.

CDOW: you should have put in more parking.

ME: I wish we could have but the building and the current parking lot are bounded on all four sides by city streets.

CDOW: If you couldn't provide me parking you shouldn't even have a store here (storms off)

ME: (under my breath) well, that would clear up your parking problem ...

*(I am cashier at a pet store. I see a man walk into the store, pick up a large and expensive coffee table book on show dogs, and get in my line. My manager has warned me, and shown me a picture of this man. He tries to convince cashiers to give him a refund for items he has just stolen. I immediately page my manager, who, unbeknownst to me, is tied up with a minor medical emergency in the back of the store.)*

Thief: “I want to return this item.”

Me: “Do you have a receipt?”

Thief: “No.”

Me: “I’m very sorry, sir. Without a receipt, I cannot give you a refund.”

Thief: “Give me a refund.”

Me: “Sir, I watched you pick that book up when you came in. I know you did not buy it.”

Thief: “Give me the f****** money, or I’ll kick your a**.” 

*(Most of the customers in my line start backing away.)*

Me: “Sir, I cannot give you any money, and if you leave with that item I will call the police. Please leave the store.”

Thief: “You little a**-hole!”

*(The thief grabs the front of my shirt, and rears his arm back to punch me. I throw my arms up to shield my face. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a flash of movement. The next thing I see is a spatter of blood on my counter, and the man out cold on the floor with a bloody nose. My manager, with a paramedic from the earlier emergency, walks up.)*

Manager: “What the heck just happened?”

*(As I tell my story, an assistant manager calls the police, opens another line, and checks out the waiting customers. The paramedic starts checking on the man, who has a clearly broken nose. The man slowly regains consciousness, and points to me.)*

Thief: “She assaulted me! I’m going to sue!”

*(I talk to the police.)*

Me: “He grabbed me, but I never hit him. I don’t know how he got hurt!” 

*(The man, a known criminal, is handcuffed and put in the police car. The officers and my manager go to review the security cameras. About ten minutes later, I get called to come back to the office.)*

Manager: “You have got to watch this!”

*(The camera footage clearly shows the man getting the book, getting in line, arguing with me, and then grabbing my shirt. At that moment, the customer in line after him, a tiny, middle-aged Asian woman, leaps up, grabs the hair on the back of his head, slams his face into my counter, and then calmly steps back to where she had been standing. She did it so quickly, that we have to run the footage back on slow to see exactly what she had done. After the thief is out cold, she walks over to the new line that the assistant manager opened, buys her bag of cat food with cash, and leaves without a word.

 ""Thank you for calling, can you hold for just a moment please?""

""NO!  I need to talk to the reptile person NOW!""

""I am the 'reptile' person, but I'm with another customer it'll be just a moment""

I'm already cringing.  I put her on hold as soon as I finish explaining I'm with somebody, because I know people like this, and if I ask her to hold again, she'll just refuse.  So she gets put on hold for a little less than 30 seconds.  I finish bagging up my other customer's crickets and turn my attention back to the phone.

""Hello, how may I help you today""

""I told you not to put me on hold""

""I apologize, but I have to take care of the customers in the store first m'am""

At this point she starts going off on me.

""Well, my lizard is DYING, he won't eat, and I don't think he's drinking, and I NEED HELP and he could have DIED when you put me on hold!!!""

""I'm sorry, please slow down, can you tell me what kind of lizard?""

""He's a leopard gecko""

""And when did you buy him from us?""

""Oh, I didn't get him there, I got him at a reptile show""

(At this point, I could have just told her that it is not my responsibility, as she did not purchase it from our store.  But I can understand that she is under stress and trying to help this poor little lizard survive, so I'm going to do my best to try and point her in the right direction.)

""Well, I can tell you what we would do for our reptiles here if they seem to stop eating.""  I go on to explain to her how you can sometimes open their mouth and get them started on a cricket, on using different supplements to make sure he's getting nutrition out of it.  But most importantly, I recommend to her that she go find a vet who deals with exotics.  If he's really looking that bad, she needs to take him to a professional.

""I'VE ALREADY TRIED TO! I tried putting a cricket in his mouth and he won't eat it!!! I don't WANT to pay for a vet bill!  He doesn't look good! What do I do???""

""It sounds like you're doing all you can, the only other thing you can do for him is you need to take him to a vet.""

I almost laughed out loud at what she said next.

""I want to speak with your manager.""

""Please hold""

I put the phone on hold.  
Ok.  I can be empathetic to a point.  I can understand that somebody might take their frustration out on me when something is wrong with the pet we sold them.  The problem is, we didn't sell her this gecko, and I am not a certified veterinarian...if he's really that bad, she needs to get off of the phone with me and CALL A DAMN VET.

I told my manager the short version of the story and he picked up the phone and reiterated to her what I already had said.  

According to him, she threatened to call corporate on us and hung up on him.  

I don't know what happened to her lizard, but I can only hope that she comes to her senses and takes him to a vet, but I highly doubt it.  ","Dear Pet Store Shoppers: WE ARE NOT YOUR VET!

chesterfeildsofa,31,,97,1ox4ap,,455,"When I turned 21, my mom got me a job at a gas station where one of her friend's son was the manager. I grew up with him until i was around 8 and he would randomly come by our house to see my mom from time to time. Of course, like some mothers do, she tried to set us up numerous times. I rolled my eyes and ignored it. 

After working there around 9 months, my manager was being promoted to the IT department of the company. Suddenly i realized how much I would miss him being around all the time and asked him out. We've been together for over 3 years now and have a 1 year old daughter.

Anyway, back to the story. His replacement as our manager seemed like a nice guy. He said he liked me because before anyone knew who he was, he had come into the store as a customer and I went above and beyond to help him. 

Turns out, he was a douche. Any little thing we did wrong he would belittle me and my coworkers. We had a store meeting in the back room one time and he bought food for everyone...except me. I had to run the registers while everyone else sat in the back room eating and discussing things that were going to change at our location. A few days later, i was doing something and he bitched at me saying ""We just had a meeting and talked about this multiple times, chesterfeildsofa. I know you're not as stupid as you look, but you need to work on listening."" I reminded him that I wasn't in the meeting, I was running the registers. He said it wasn't a good excuse because he had posted a summary of everything from the meeting on the cork board, yet no one even mentioned that to me. 

The final straw came when one night, he was about to go home. He asked me if I knew how to deal with vendors and that Pepsi was coming later that night to pick up a case of stuff that went bad. I said yeah and he said if I had any problems to call him. Pepsi came, and the paper work confused me. It said he was taking 24 20oz bottles of Pepsi, but the case set out had other kinds of bottle on it. I called my manager and he doesn't pick up. I don't know what to do, so the Pepsi guys says he will just get it the next time he comes to the store.

The next day i come in for my shift and my manager calls me into his office. he asks me what happened, I explained it all to him, and he says ""If you didn't know how to do it, you should have just said so instead of just making yourself look too stupid to do something so simple."" Then he sent me back out. 

I stood at my register for around 30 minutes contemplating walking out. I asked my coworker if she could handle the customers by herself, and she said yes. i told her I was leaving. I close my register and walked into the office to get my stuff. My manager immediately yells t me to leave because he was conducting an interview. I said ""Andre, I can't take you anymore. I'm sick and tired of your shit, so you can go fuck yourself, I'm out"" and walked out the door. 

My manager comes after me as I am getting into my car. he tries to get me to come back and I scream ""No, I'm done! I'm tired of you making me feel miserable all the fucking time so you can just shove this job up your ass"" and took off. 

Later, my coworker told me when he walked back inside he immediately told her I was banned from the store. After hearing that, i realized i need my last paycheck stub. I had direct deposit, so I needed to get on the office computer to print my stub out. I emailed the company via their website, explained what happened, and said I just wanted my last paycheck stub. I got a phone call from the district manager, explained again what happened, and she said she was sorry I felt I had to leave like that. Then she offered to talk to the other district managers around the city and see if I could be hired on at a different store. I said yes, and got my job back working with a super awesome manager lady. (Also my boyfriend had nothing to do with getting my job back. He could have helped, but he told me he wouldn't because it would mess with his reputation in the company and possibly get him fired. I understood that and didn't even ask)

That really pissed my old manager off. He felt like me walking out on him should have made me blacklisted from ever getting a job with them again. I felt all happy inside knowing that he was pissed.

Oh it gets better

Remember how he was conducting an interview when I walked out? He ended up hiring the guy. 6 months later, they realize cigarettes are missing as well as some money. They catch the guy on camera, fire and prosecute him. Then my old manager gets fired for not catching the guy sooner.","Final Straw from Mr. Asshole Manager, sweet turn of events",552,talesFromRetail
comefullcircle,114,,82,1b58bx,,461,"I work for the coffee chain that has you rolling up rims right now. I was having an absolutely abysmal day at work. One of those days where several times the thought of walking off the floor to go have a good, few minute long cry and scream fest makes its way into your head. (Or maybe that's just me...) 


Anyway, part of why it was such a terrible day was I was working the drive thru speaker. I have ""the voice"" for it, so I'm always there. I went from loving it, to liking, tolerating, disliking... to loathing. Policy is to suggestively sell what our hot item is right now. To every car. I hate doing this, but its part of my job.


There's one customer who really hates hearing this. So much so he will cut you off as soon as you say ""would you like..."" with a very loud ""NO!"" and go on into a long-winded rant about how we need to stop with the advertising and how it annoys him very much, and repeat that same speech to the person working in window when he gets his order. Managers told us to just tell him to write head office or visit our Facebook page. I've dealt with him about a couple of dozen times. After a slew of rude, mindless, dumb people, I hear the abrupt ""NO!"" while I'm in the middle of one of my ""leave the floor and cry"" thoughts. 


I take a deep breath, grip the counter as tight as I can, and interrupt his speech with my own. ""Sir, this is part of my job. I hate it. I hate it just as much as you do, if not, more. (I get gradually louder, and end every sentence with more emphasis.) You know how much this annoys you the one time in the span of a few days you hear it? This annoys me just as much, every time I say it. To hundreds of cars a day. 5 days of the week. But, I am required to do this. Being a person who likes having a job, I do it. Yelling at me will change nothing. Yelling at my coworker in the window will change nothing. There is nothing we can do about it. So I beg you sir. Please tell head office how you feel about this. Visit the Facebook page, write them letters, call them, show up on their doorstep. Whatever you have to do to show them how much you hate this and want it to stop. Because I want that just as much as you do."" 


There's a very heavy, uncomfortable silence. All my coworkers are staring at me. My shoulders are moving with my deep, shaky breaths. I'm hunched over the counter, fingers hurting from holding it so hard. Now at any point he could have driven away, but he didn't. He listened to everything I said. He mumbles his order, and I tell him his total, and that my coworker will meet him at the window.


There were no cars ahead of him in the queue so he was the next vehicle up to the window. I'm watching from close by. My coworker repeats the total. He fumbles for a debit card. When he hands him the machine the customer asks, without looking at him ""So you guys have a Facebook page?"" Coworker nods. ""Yes sir. Our Facebook page is for people to leave comments, concerns and dislikes about the service we offer. You can write on their wall, or follow the link to the guest service form you can fill out online, or call the phone number posted there."" He hands back the debit machine, takes his order, blinks slowly and gives a quick, gruff nod before leaving. I like to think that was an apology.


Now I was very lucky that my manager had left for the day and it was a supervisor on the floor during that in-between time waiting for the afternoon manager to start their shift. The supervisor on the floor came up to me, took my headset away and sent me to replenish every bit of low stock we had, then clean any bit of mess or disorganization I could find. Basically keeping me away from customer interaction. Nothing was said about my rant. It's as if it didn't happen. I honestly don't know if I'm in trouble or not. I feel like this particular supervisor wouldn't bring it up to a higher up, but I suppose I'll find out tomorrow. Now even though the supervisor didn't say anything about it, my ears were practically bleeding from praise coming from my coworkers.


Tl;dr - Customer hates up selling. I told him to get off his ass and instead of yelling at me, yell at head office to see it gets changed. Coworkers rejoiced. Not sure if I'm in shit or not.


Edit: Spacing.

mitzubee,62,,85,1egqim,,458,"A few years ago I was starting my first ever retail job in a store that sold all sorts of things cheaply. 

This was my second day on the job and I was stocking the shelves with toothpaste when a customer came up to me and asked if we had measuring tapes. As the store is rather large and I had no idea where things were at the time, and as I only had an hour to finish up the shelves I didn't want to waste too much time running around the store. I turned to my supervisor (who was a few metres away) to ask her if we had any measuring tapes. The supervisor simply answered ""no we don't have any"" (out of earshot of the customer) I relayed the message to the customer, apologised and carried on with my shelves. 5 minutes later the customer came back to me quite annoyed with a measuring tape in hand saying ""what type of worker are you? You don't even know what you store sells!"" I apologised saying that it was only my second day there so wasn't a 100% of what stock we had and that a colleague had said we didn't have any (I wasn't going to make out that I'd answered 'no' because I didn't know and wanted to get rid of her). When the customer walked off I informed my supervisor that we did have measuring tapes and her answer was ""F***ing customers are just too lazy to look around the store themselves, I can't be bothered with them so I just tell them we don't have whatever they're looking for"".

I learnt a lesson that day: 
1) Unless you have no idea, just go look for yourself.
2) Never ask THAT supervisor where something is as a customer.

Our security guard, let's say Mike, was hovering near the door, as is his norm.

I flag him over and tell him about Jane, only to then notice a black shape poking out of her top. It was clearly a bottle of tagged vodka. He and I both gave each other 'that look' and she was confronted about it. Paraphrased conversation goes something like:

Mike: Ma'am mind if I ask you to step over here

Jane: I didn't do anything *covers chest with hand*

Mike: Ma'am I can clearly see a security tag sticking out of your top

jessbakescakes,49,,95,1mbftr,,458,"The store I work at is set up so that one door is an entrance, another is an exit, and they're connected by a vestibule/atrium area where we keep the carts. As you pass through the registers, the exit is right in front of you, where the carts are. TL;DR: You have to pass the cart return/cart gathering area to exit the store. 

Customers at my store have a habit of just leaving their carts in front of the service area and creating a clog. So yesterday, after one person left their cart, and several others followed suit, there was finally a break in the action so I could move the carts the four feet it took to get out the door.

CurvedStraightLine,46,,87,1k8dh9,,459,"It was the after Christmas sale at my store, which is as near hell as I want to get.  Hordes of women would descend on our store in that one week, ripping through clothes, destroying the store.  The workload shot through the roof as women decided they NEEDED one shirt, but it wasn't available in their size, and an employee would be tied up for an hour calling around for it, only to find that the sole store that still had that size in stock had it on hold for a customer who may or may not ever come back.  Worst, the reduced prices on everything meant that our staffing (decided by hourly sales) was actually less than it logically should be.

Management took turns closing the store during those hellacious weeks, and I had the bad luck of closing during the pre-sale.  This was when we only opened the store to certain customers after hours, an act that only ramped up the self entitlement.

The store closed at six, and reopened for the VIPs at 6:30.  It was catered, so as the droves descended on our store, I sent employees to vainly grab up spilled and stained clothing, and wipe up the wine splashed on the carpet.

The event ended at 11, but the last VIP didn't leave until midnight.  I turned around to look at the destruction that used to be high end retail.  Clothes on the floor, clothes literally drifted against the walls in the fitting room like snow after a blizzard.  Heaps of put backs burying the tables they were on.  All of which was punctuated with abandoned plates with half eaten food, grapes chased under tables, cheese trampled into the carpet underfoot.

I rallied my crew, doing my best to beat their demoralization, and we set to reassembling the store.  I signed them all out for extra labor hours with an email to corporate, and tucked into the big clean.  Along the way, we abandoned uncomfortable high heels and jackets.  I ended up half in clothing out of my gym bag, hair pulled back, just battling the mess left behind.

By 1:30, we almost had it licked.  Then, I heard the noise of someone yanking the door.

We actually had an issue at this location, where people would pull the doorhandle repeatedly.  Our neighboring store actually had their door handle ripped off by customers just not accepting that the store might be closed. And this was obviously one of those times.  The customer was just banging at the door to get in.

They looked tipsy, which made sense.  There were two restaurants in the mall that served mixed drinks until the wee hours.  They probably had just gotten kicked out.

Puzzling over why they were here, I remembered that a set of keys had been found earlier in the evening.  So, I summoned my best retail smile I could muster, and unlocked the door.

They instantly shoved the door open, hitting my foot, but I wasn't about to let them in.  Through the open crack they looked at me confused ""Are you open?""

I know that question deserved a firm but polite no, but instead it just broke my brain.  I stammered out a confused ""n-no?  No?""

She stared at me confused for a minute and then asked if she could come in and ""shop around"" a little.

I still was not processing this.  The stupidity of it just made my brain cease and I just kept repeating ""No?"" at her.

She turns to her friend and says something about having to come back ""tomorrow"" in a snarky voice.  At which point one of my employees, fueled with retail rage comes up behind me and yells ""It IS tomorrow!"" and slams the door shut on them.

[Front page post about fake $100 printed in a five reminded me of this:](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/135t51/if_you_work_in_retail_watch_out_for_this_just/)

We had an old employee come back through our store 2 years after he had moved to AZ. The fucked up part was that this old employee passed us a counterfeit $100. He and his buddy decided to target one of his old girlfriends and keep her occupied while the bought some $3 item with the fake hundred. It worked... in a way. She took the money but someone else caught it later that day in cash office. It was a horrible bad forgery. It was on some thin construction paper and the pic didn't even line up. The damn thing almost could be split into two pieces through the middle. 

So we called the cops and the bank, they took care of it. Not the first time we had been given fake money. /shrug Fast forward 2 days.

I get a call asking for a manager, I respond that I was one or we had the OPs manager here today. He asked how long we would be there today and if he could ask for us when he got there... (I am thinking oh great, what kind of customer was I gonna get this time) I say yep and I tell him we will both be here till two. 

About an hour later in walks two guys, *very* nondescript. Average hair cut, nothing remarkable about either of them. They ask the front desk for me by name and I get the radio call and head up there. 

""Hi are you (Me)?

Me: Yep, what can I do for yah?

About this time, you heart just starts racing. The motherfucking Secret Service is asking for you to step into the office. I call my other manager and I tell the girl at the front desk to divert calls and such. We go to the office. Heart still going. I head in with the manager and they tell us the situation. They were sent from Denver to track a long trail of fake $100's that started in AZ. The Secret Service had been following our old employee and his buddy. 

Me and my manager now feel like secret agents tracking spies and shit. We show them our footage of the money transaction (we had already made a tape for police) and everything. Turns out these were two of the most laid back guys I had ever met. Despite their job title, they were extremely cool. We spent about 45 minutes in the office when I get a radio call ""He is here...."" ?

Me: ""Who is here??"" 

Front desk girl: ""Employee with the fake money...""

He never left town. He was coming back to the store to flirt with his ex-that he had just given fake money to a couple days before.... I look at the Secret Service guys with an almost gleaming smile and said, ""The dumb bastard came back, he is in our TV section right now."" They both lit up like it was Christmas. They weren't expecting this.  I show them the camera and where he was and what he looked like. 

""Stay here"" We did.
 They both stand up, unzip their jackets reveling the gun you knew was there but never actually saw until then and they march out of the office. They dumbass never saw them coming, with his back turned they swooped in. One grabbed him by the shoulder while the other came around front. (we were watching on the surveillance cameras). Both had a hand on their gun, they asked him his name and identified themselves as agents with the Secret Service.

We went to the front counter, where the one agent nodded us an appreciation nod while their other marched him out in handcuffs.

A couple of years ago I was working in a sandwich restaurant. A guy came in with his young (5ish) daughter. He ordered 2 subs. I made his according to his specifications, then asked what veggies he would like on his daughter's sub. 

He tells me ""Lettuce, tomato and no mustard."" So I put the veggies on the sub and said to him ""So you don't want mustard, but would you like any other sauce?"" He repeats, ""no mustard."" I figure that means he doesn't want sauce at all, so I close the sub and start wrapping it.

He then proceeded to flip the fuck out and yells at me, ""I want mayonaise on that!"" I apologize, re-open the sandwich, and he starts screaming again ""listen honey, I've been a manager at (different fast food restaraunt) for 10 years now, your job isn't that hard""

Since he's flat out screaming at me, I'm getting pissed, so I retorted with ""I asked you what sauce you wanted, you didn't tell me, I may have an easy job, but it sure gets hard when my customers can't pay attention.""

He continued to scream about how dumb and rude I was, and how easy my job is until the store across the mall from us called security. It took the security guard almost 10 minutes to get him out of my store. Once the security guard almost had him out of the mall, no mustard guy started threatening the guard and the cops ended up coming, he was arrested for uttering threats, and child services were called.

melodyponddd,73,,123,159iyd,,460,"So, it was another night in the fitting rooms. It was an especially busy day in the red and khaki store. The new Jason Wu clothing line had just dropped and a bunch of women were waiting outside the door before opening as if it were Black Friday. 

Knowing I was scheduled in the Fitting Room I had a wave of anxiety crash over me, but I held my head high. I knew I could do this. 

The doors opened and sure enough all the women went rushing to the clothing line. I busied myself as much as I could while I braced for the oncoming storm.

It actually wasn't too bad. All the women were incredibly respectful of one another. If a woman tried on something that didn't fit, a complete stranger would ask if they could try it on. People were becoming friendly with each other, swapping clothes, laughing while they waited in line. It was very pleasant. 

As the day went on, the Jason Wu items were scarce. The accessories (the scarves and handbags) were the first to go. I found myself having to make calls to our surrounding stores to see if they had any in stock. Some did, some didn't. 

There was a nice African-American couple trying things on. I struck up a conversation with the boyfriend/husband while his girlfriend/wife was trying on clothes. 

Enter Rich Old Bitch. This woman came to my desk decked out head to toe in animal fur clothing, designer hand bag, nails done, and her face freshly Botoxed. Her fake nose was as far in the clouds as I could see. 

ROB: Excuse me, but I would like to know where all the handbags are. 

You know how in movies and television shows rich people have that...accent/tone of voice where it just oozes with ""I'm rich therefore I'm better than you""? That is how she sounded. 

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, we sold out of those fairly quickly. If you would like, I can call other stores for you.  

The lady said that was fine and she waited while I called up stores. During this time, I noticed she was very put off by the African American couple. Her nose kind of scrunched and she pursed her lips. The African American gentleman was very nice, said hello to her, and tried to make conversation. The old woman didn't have any of it. 

After a while, I hung up the phone and told the lady that one of the stores still had one handbag left. Since they are a promotional item it couldn't be put on hold but if she left now she'd have a good chance of making it. The lady said that was fine and asked what store it was. I told her the location. Now, I live in a primarily rich town. Myself and my family aren't rich by any means but we are surrounded with rich folks. This location was in a safe area, but not the wealthiest area in town. 

She came out with this lovely statement: 

ROB: Oh, never mind. I don't want to shop where all the poor black people and illegals shop. 

The couple had left, at this time but they were still within earshot. The boyfriend went to turn around but the girl stopped him. I was furious with this woman. From the way she treated the couple up until now i just couldn't stand her ignorance. So, I came up with a white lie on the spot. 

Me: EXCUSE ME? I'll have you know my stepfather, who is a lawyer, is black. How dare you. If you need any more help I will call one of my associates because I refuse to help you. 

The lady did not know what to say. She paled and mumbled an apology and got the hell out of the store. The couple approached me and the boyfriend asked if my stepdad really was black. 

Me: Nah. I don't even have a stepdad. I knew I couldn't yell at her so I got back at her the only way I could; making sure she knew she was an embarrassment. 

The guy laughed, gave me a fist bump, and told me to have a good day.

So I was working at a major gig venue in a major city, some awful band was playing but I was working with another guy on the stage door/guest list. Shortly before the afterparty started, we got the usual rush of people from the main auditorium to our door. One guy said his name to my colleague, not on the list. He goes absolutely nuts, screaming ""DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM I'VE PLAYED HERE A HUNDRED TIMES YOU SECURITY ARE ALL THICK YOU JOBSWORTH WANKERS"" (not exact but you get the idea). He's screaming this at two security guards, one of whom is a former serviceman and the other (myself) whose hobby is kickboxing. Eventually we get him away from our door (it wasn't pretty) and get back to the list. We sort out the next guy pretty quickly, apologize for the wait and the guy in front of him, blah blah, without really looking at him. ""What a knob, mate. You shouldn't have to deal with dicks like that."" I hear. I look up, and none other than Johnny Vaughan is stood in front of me calling some randomer a knob. Had a chuckle, let him in, and suddenly the night seemed a little better.

Klaus_Hargreeves,34,,105,1lfngj,,455,"The setting:
Busy coffee shop right off the freeway, packed with hungry, caffeine-starved folks of all ages and backgrounds. We are frequented by homeless/van-living customers, and they are usually the most respectful, nice customers we have. 
I'm on register at this point, and there is a line wrapped almost to the door. Ohhhhhhh boy.

The disheveled girl:
A girl of about 18, maybe younger, comes in, very tired and just pacing back and forth in front of our little food case. I can tell she's had a rough day, and it's HOT outside. She's wearing a backpack with books nearly busting out the seams, and sweating. I couldn't tell if she was homeless, but her face had dirt on it, and her clothes looked ragged. On a normal day, I would've probably spent a few minutes asking about her day and wishing her well, but this was too busy a day to be personal. Boo.

The problem:
Disheveled girl is holding one of our water bottles. We offer water for free in cups, and on hot days, most orders we get have a water included. She's been waiting for our line to die down and just chilling near the food case. I think a lot of people wait for the line to die down so they can get more help, if they don't know what they want. Anyhow, this very pissed off looking girl (We'll call her PO) starts yelling at disheveled girl (DG from now on). DG gets a deer in the headlights look and doesn't even respond at first.


PO is yelling ""Thief, are you going to PAY for that water?!"" 

DG: ""I haven't been through the line...""

PO, to me: ""MAKE SURE SHE PAYS FOR THAT! HEY! YOU!""

Me: ""I uh.. It's really not her turn in line yet."" I eye all the customers in line.

PO: ""JUST GET THE MONEY!""


At this point I counted her as one of our crazies, and went back to helping the very shocked looking line of customers again, trying to lighten the situation up a bit. A few coffees and teas later, I see PO poke her head behind the employee area.. Oh no. I get scared when people come into the employee area, because it's never been a good reason. 


Me: (a bit stunned) ""Miss, what... what are you doing?""

PO: ""SHE HAS TO PAY FOR THAT! SHE'S a THIEF!""

Me: ""Miss, I will help you shortly, the line is moving rather quickly and I'll get to you, please."" I gesture out at customer side of the store.

I turn to DG with a sympathetic smile and say ""Sweetie, would you like a large cup of ice water? It's rather hot out. No charge."" But she just kinda stumbles up to the counter out of line, doesn't say a word, puts two bucks down, and walks towards the door. PO came behind the employee area again.

PO: ""Where's the money?!""

I was so infuriated with this crazy customer that I just pointed at the money, then pointed at the back of the line, giving a very ""WTF"" face. Then I remembered I ought to be polite, as I don't really know her story. I sigh, and say ""Miss, I promise, I will help you when it's your turn in line, but please do NOT come back here."" If she wasn't a tiny girl, I would've been scared she was going to try to rob me. Crazy tiny girls can still fuck you up, though.


PO goes back around to the customer side, yelling at this girl along the lines of ""theif"" and ""Sketchy"". And I mean YELLING at this point. Even though it was busy, I left my spot (I'm supposed to be PLANTED and not move for anything when it's this busy, or else I get yelled at. This is one of those rules that, if you break, it fucks over all the other employees.) to get my manager so he could escort this crazy person out of our store. But he was already on his way out to see what all the commotion was about, so I happily resumed my place on register, relieved that this would be resolved. 


As it turns out.. PO was not just a customer, but a worker at another location in my chain, scheduled to work in our store for the day. She went to the back and had a long chat with our store manager, and never came on the floor for her scheduled shift. I'm not sure what they talked about, but I haven't seen her back since. I hope she got a stern reminder of our company policy, and to never YELL at customers like that.

PO, I hope you do not come back, as you are scary and mean.

Broniba,58,,103,1p0b7t,,456,"Backstory: So, at my little corner of coffee house bliss, we have an extra room attached to our main shop that used to be a liquor store - when it closed, we bought it and turned it into an event room that people could rent out for meetings, parties, what have you. It's not part of the general shop and we reinforce this by keeping the door closed - however, it isn't always locked because potential renters often want to see the space to see if it'll fit their needs, what they need to rent so far as furniture, yada yada. All this to say, room is there, not supposed to be used unless you have reserved and paid for this room. 

Well, last night as I was manning the bar, I notice two ladies open that door and walk into the room. Now, these ladies had been sitting (just the two of them) at our largest table for over an hour at this point sipping their free cups of ice water. They were both very obviously well to do - they gave off that ""vibe"" of 'I'm rich and you're not and we both know it'. Well, they'd been there until I'd gone to the table about ten minutes earlier placing down the ""reserved table"" sign and letting them know that, no rush, but in about thirty minutes a group was coming in that had previously reserved that big table. They didn't seem to have any problem with that at the time, so I went back to work. 

Didn't think about them again till my co worker says ""I wonder what they're doing."" I look up, and see the ladies disappearing into the room. Well, co worker is very new, so I told him that if he'd watch the bar for a minute, I'd go ask. I honestly figured maybe they'd seen the room and were wanting to rent it or something. So I walk back, and was thoroughly puzzled to see them sitting at one of the tables in there still sipping on their waters - in the dark, I might add. No event equals no lights on in the room and only the light from the shop coming through the door window. I open the door, and the following conversation occurred with Rich Lady (or, RL from now on):

Me: Hi there, ladies. Can I help you with anything?"" 

RL: We're just having a conversation. There were getting to be too many people in there. 

Me: Haha, I understand, it gets a bit crowded sometimes. I'm sorry to tell you, though, that this room isn't part of the general shop area. It's a special room we save for reservations. 

RL: But we're just having a conversation (kid you not, same phrase twice, as though I somehow missed it the first time)

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but this room can only be used for folks who have reserved and paid for it. 

Cue facial expression that lets me, the minimum wage plebe, know exactly that she, Ms. Rich and Fancy Pants, does not appreciate my trying to tell her that she can't have her way. 

RL: ""Ugh, I know what this room is for, I've paid for it before.""

...Wait...so you know what the room is for, you've used it and noted that no one from the main shop wandered in and crashed your party, yet you can't seem to understand why I'm asking you to leave said room? Honey, Sugar pie...use the brains so well concealed by your bad dye job. 

I think my confusion must have shown a lot because she rolled her eyes and huffed again. I tried one more time. 

Me: I'm really very sorry, ladies, but I'm not allowed to let our regular customers use this room without reservation for any reason. 

One more big huff and they start to get up. And leave their cups on the table as they stiffly walk out and flounce out the door. 

I just...I don't get people! Seriously! You came into a very crowded, very public shop, but somehow deigned that your conversation was so deep and dark and mysterious that you literally needed to go through a closed door into a dark room and have your talk there...and then you're gonna act surprised when we notice.

Uniquitous,34,,145,1n6vlm,,455,"Back in the long, long ago, before terrorists made us lose our collective shit, I worked at a discount store with a floral name. I worked in the section that sold TVs, VCRs, little stereos, and for some reason, guns.

That's right, we sold rifles, shotguns, ammo and accessories for both. My 16 year old self had the keys to the display rack and trigger locks, so if we had ever come under attack I suppose I would have been in great shape to return fire.
Anyway, one day a couple of bubbas came through to purchase some deer-killing-devices. My assistant manager (a weedy sort of fellow, good natured though) was on hand to have them sign the paperwork, which they did, and I accepted their payment and bid them good day. Standard procedure was to alert the front desk that a firearms purchase had been made.

So, I pick up the phone and dial the extension for the front desk, and (giving my manager a wink and a smirk) say ""Teresa...? Um... there are two men with guns heading in your direction...""

BadKitty1011,238,,118,1mxqrk,,449,"I swear the full moon brings these people out from under their slime-encrusted rocks for the sole purpose of pissing hairdressers off.  So, TFR, I present to you the top 5 things to NEVER say to your stylist.

**1. ""But how much is it for just a trim?  I don't need a cut, just a trim.""**

It's the same fucking price.  It takes us just as much time to cut off half an inch as it does to cut off six inches.  If I use my scissors, it's a cut.  Period.

**2. ""So, is this your real job?  Or will you go to college and have a career someday?""**

What the hell constitutes a ""real job"" anyway?  For your information, we do go to college.  There's a hell of a lot more to this profession than you think.  We have to have an understanding of chemistry, art, mathematics, psychology and geometry.  Bite me.

**3. ""Can you tell me how to fix this colour?""** 

No.  I can fix it for you, but I'll be damned if I give away my knowledge so you can run down the street to the nearest drugstore and buy a box, then call me up and scream at me when you screw it up.  Do you go to your mechanic and ask him how to fix your car?  Your dentist and ask her how to fill your cavity?  I don't think so.

**4. ""It'll only take 5 minutes to cut it.  You don't look busy.""  Also along the same line, ""I need it done right now!""**

Don't tell me how long it takes me to do my job.  Sure, I'll cut for 5 minutes, but it'll look like I did just that.  Plus, you'll pay the same amount as if I cut for 30.  And I may not be busy right this second, but if I say I can't accomodate you, I have someone coming in very shortly.  Someone who took the time to make an appointment.  Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.

**5. ""I couldn't find a sitter, they'll be fine.""**

No.  No they won't.  Salons are dangerous places, and our equipment is expensive.  The ones who show up with 2 kids for their chemical service are always the ones who assume we're babysitters, and tune them out with a magazine or phone.  If I wanted to work with kids, I would have gone to school for it.  These ones will also yell at me when I tell their precious little snowflakes to not pump up or bounce on the chairs.  Those chairs are expensive, and they're not anchored to the floor, it can't be done.  Of course, when snowflake busts his lip open when the chair tips, they'll flip shit and threaten to sue.  Leave the kids at home, or cancel the appointment if need be.  

**Bonus tip - to the wives and girlfriends, there is no need to hover over me while I cut your man's hair.  I'm not going to whip off my shirt and give him a lap dance if you go sit down.  I'm a stylist, not a stripper.**",How To Piss Off Your Stylist,567,talesFromRetail
sinspider,35,,116,1hd8fs,,454,"More tales from the comic shop. This one in particular has stuck with me very clearly over the years and frankly is one im sure that most people in retail that have stores that 'hold' stock can relate to. Tl:DR at bottom

In my last year at the store we were taken over by new owners (again) and frankly they were rather nice. South african family who were straight shooters and albeit did things differently, were still great to work for. They allowed all of us in our respective roles to have more responsibility. I became known as the 'Comic book nazi' (see Seinfields soup nazi) for dealing with people that others were afraid to, such as the person in this story. 

Our store meant that your could pre-order figurines before they were made, 3 months in advance with a deposit and the customer would know the date the figures would come into the store and had 2 months to pay and pick it up due to us calling them and/or letter. (amazing amount of time in my opinion).  It should be noted that even with a small store markup, most of these figures were minimum $100 if not over $1000 for the epic collectors pieces. 

I started going through a lot of these orders and discovered that a number of customers had been taking advantage of these extended collection period and would not pay for and/or pick things up for 6 months or greater. More when they felt they had the spare money, which had lead to the back of our shop overflowing with boxes. It was honestly silly to the point of where we had no where to put our own bags in the back of the shop due to there being no room. 

I took it upon myself to start chasing a lot of these people up to collect their shit or at least start making consistent payments on it instead of just the minimum (deposit) and if they didn't it would be put on sale for another customer. 

For the most part customers were appreciative. Many had forgotten they had ordered it or were embarrassed to have been taken advantage for so long, which cleared a lot of space in a short time. Some were a bit more aggressive until i explained things to them. 

eg sinspider: most places will only hold orders for a week or less and you've had this in storage for 4 months with no additional money paid etc and if i had not called you likely would have forgotten about it at all so at least we had the courtesy to call you.
customer:...ill be in this afternoon

Anyway, this particular customer has never left my mind (lets call her FM for fucking mole). This was a person who believed anyone else (especially retail) was beneath her. Which was ironic because she was a militant feminist bogan which was...well she was the first i had encountered in my life. FM had been a customer since the store had opened but for rarer, hard to find items and upon checking how long her orders were sitting out the back some had been sitting out there for as long as 18 months! 

This woman was also one whom knew when our busiest periods of the month were but would still call up and keep one of the staff on the phone for half an hour or more looking for specific issues of specific comics and then drive straight to the store expecting that they would all be waiting for her in the 5 minutes it took her to get there. She did this to me twice. 

FM: I want all these things. (list as long as my forearm)

Sinspider: sure thing but you understand most of these comics have not been in print for many months, even years. I will do what i can to find these for you and put them aside for you. Just be aware the new catalogs are out and we are very busy at the moment so they might not be aside until tomorrow.

FM: sure thing, thanks.

(fast forward **7minutes**)

FM (at counter behind other customer): **loud sigh**

FM (reaching counter): **exasperated sigh** so have you put everything aside for me?

Sinspider: um...i told you on the phone that we were extremely busy and i have not left this counter since you rang me. Id be happy to go looking for you and see what i can find but it may take some time.

FM: so go.

(containing rage, jump ahead 30 mins)

I have found maybe half the list after neglecting every other customer in a very busy period to help FM and the rest we simply dont have in stock (from over 9000 comics) and cannot order in. FM lets out a loud sigh every time i don't walk up to her with the counter with her entire order, enough that the whole store could hear. I explain this to her but instead of thanks she begins to complain about the service. We are not helping her. We are not looking after one of our best customers **cough** and so on. No thanks for the thousands of comics i searched through to find her the crap she wanted to begin with. Anyway i digress, i was just setting up the type of personality this FM is. 

Back to the 18 month old orders. It turns out she was coming in and picking up the 'must have' pieces every 6 months (still way over what we allowed) and leaving other pieces behind. I called her up and the conversation followed as thus:

Sinspider: Hi FM, im sinspider from *comic store* and im just calling to let you know that it has been 18 + months since you have made any form of payment on 'x' items and many others. If you don't come in to collect your items in the next 7 days they will be put back on the shelf.

FM: **abuse and more abuse and then some occasional words** I paid for a deposit and i continue to order from you guys you have no right those are legally mine i will take you to court if you try and take them from me.

Sinspider: True you paid a deposit for them but you have not paid any further amount since then, being well over a year and we very rarely see you in the store. Our policy is to hold stock for only 2 months and you have clearly exceeded this.

FM: **abuse followed by your doing this because im a woman** 

Sinspider: FM i have just told you exactly what our policy is and you can take it from me and my bosses that no longer are any freeloaders taking advantage of our policies anymore. 

FM: **FUCK YOU**
*hangs up*

I thought i was going to be in trouble from the newer owners for how i handled the call. Instead they were happy for me dealing with her for taking up an entire shelf with items that weren't profitable. I find out later that she came in the next day. Picked up the cheapest figure that she had (**$40**) and abused the staff again and continued to do so after purchase. I arrived on my shift to see this abuse carrying on. Not knowing who she was told her to GFTO of the store and not come back and she recognized my voice. She leaves the store and doesn't meet my gaze and we dont hear from her again.  

Her crap gets put back out for sale and all sold within the next week earning the owners some $600 from her deposits that were nullified and some of her figures were worth even more netting them $1500 total. And thus earning me my new title of Comic book nazi. I wore it proudly and no regular customer ever fucked with me again for fear of loosing their stuff.

meguriau,39,,137,1p961l,,450,"Hey TFR! I've been intending to make a post but struggled with wording until I came across an askreddit post and submitted my first story as a comment. I'm in the middle of procrastinating from my thesis at the moment so this first one will be almost a direct copy-paste with modifications. 

**Background** 

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. If there's any interest, I'll try to make it a point to post a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

This first story is from the early months of this year. It was my first summer working for the brand and the thermometer had not dipped under 30 degrees Celcius for several days at that point. 

My manager and I were working an incredibly busy shift when the motion sensor sounded. In came a local girl, noticeably overweight, disheveled hair, belly exposed from ill-fitting sporting attire, racquet bag over her shoulder and large quantities of chocolate smeared around the edges of her mouth. 

Without any warning or acknowledgement of any sort, she began pulling hats from almost every shelf, making it a point to try on the most expensive hats possible. In a most meticulous fashion, she went about smearing sweat and ice cream on the linen and organza hats, brushing felt hats against the direction of the nap of the fur and jamming them back onto the hat block, amongst other travesties in the process. 

Upon completing the first of her objectives, she made a rude remark about the brand with regard to some of the products then skipped off on her merry way.

A few hours later while my boss was on her lunch break, the same girl returned. As it turned out, after everything she had done, she still had the audacity to leave us her resume. I gave my boss the satisfaction of putting it through the shredder.","Please excuse my behaviour from earlier, here's my resume. [Tales from a Hat Boutique]",587,talesFromRetail

The ring, had 3 HUGE diamonds and lots of little ones around it. 

I thought it had to be fake, because of the sheer size of the diamonds, so I took it up to the front counter, and showed my manager.

The manager also thought it was fake, but we put it in the lost and found box behind the counter, just in case it had sentimental value to someone. 

Today, I go into work, having totally forgotten about the ring and find out that someone had come to see if we had it, because it was their engagement ring.

It was real. My manager thinks it would of been worth atleast 8k.

The owner was apparently almost balling her eyes out when she found out we had it.
She comes back 30 minutes later with $20 worth of scratchies as a thank you for finding it.

I try to not wear my uniform to other stores but I was in a rush so I had no choice. And unfortunately for me the store I went to had uniforms similar to the ones where I work. So as I'm getting what I need I'm of course approached by a female customer that asked "" where are the Apples?"" This is when I notice her and see that she's dressed horribly and smells horrible. She looked like a 19yr wanna be hooker.Well call her Smelly hooker (SH). I thought ' well this is gonna be great' and told  her ""I'm sorry mam but I don't know I don't work here"". This is when she proceeded to go bitch mode. SH: WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YES YOU DO YOU WORK HERE. And I calmly told ""mam I really don't work here"". SH: THAT DOES IT I WANT YOUR MANAGER. I couldn't take this anymore so I told her ""For the last time mam I don't work here. If you want the manager you'll have to find someone that does work here"". Then she just got mad and stomped away. Thinking she would get the manager I decided to hurry up get my things then get to my car. As I was about to get in I see one of the employees (I assumed was the manager) running towards me yelling ""HEY! GET BACK INSIDE AND TO MY OFFICE. NOW!""

I work at a gas station here in Canada. Its a self serve station so customers have to pump their gas themselves, but in my province, you have to pay for your gas before you pump. 

Most customers I deal with are okay with this, because this law has been in effect since 2008, but there is the occasional customer from neighbouring provinces, and the US of A that come in and make a big deal about the fact we are asking them to pre-pay for their gas.

A little back story, the law was created when a gas station attendant stepped out in front of a car that tried to steal $12 in gas, trying to stop him. The driver hit him, and he was dragged under that car for several kilometres until he died.

So I'm having a pretty good day at work, it wasn't a slow day, but there were 2 of us there, but there is only one till at our store. I was on cash and my coworker was reading the paper.

Then, an older guy comes in yelling at us about how ""the pumps not working"". I tell him there seems to be nothing wrong, (a message pops up on the till if there are any problems) and that we can complete the transaction here inside if he likes. He then starts swearing at me saying that he hasn't even pumped his gas yet. I then see his licence plate, he's from the wonderful province next to us that doesn't have this law.

I calmly explain to him that in our province you have to pay for your gas before you pump it, its not just you, everyone has to do it, and that its been the law since 2008. 

Me: ""There's no way I can turn your pump on until you pay for your gas.""

Douche Bag: ""I just filled up at [gas station] up the street and they didn't ask for me to pay first!""
(you'd think he wouldn't need gas if he ""just filled up"")

Me: ""Its the law for everyone sir.""

The old man is clearly frustrated and mad by this point, and there are a few people waiting in line behind him now. This is when my coworker chimes in.

Coworker: ""Sir, the law was put in place because a young man working at a gas station in-""

The old guy cuts him off.

Douche Bag: ""I know the whole fuckin' story! Its just stupid that we should suffer because of *some dead kid*.""

Everyone in line behind him looks at him. 

Coworker: ""That kid lost his life. This law is helping save lives from-""

Douche Bag: ""It was stupid of that kid to step out in front of that car! He would have been alive and none of us would have any trouble getting our fuckin' gas if he wasn't such a fuckin' idiot.""

By this point we are allowed to kick him out of the store for causing a disturbance, and if he doesn't we can call the police.

Me: ""Back then he was responsible for any gas not paid for.""

Coworker: ""That $12 would come out of his pay cheque and he would be fired. I'm sorry sir but your going to have to leave.""

Douche Bag: ""What the fuck is this! You can't kick me out! Just turn on my god damn pump!""

Me: ""If you don't leave now I have to call the police.""

Douche Bag: ""This is bullshit! I'm going to [other gas station up the street]! You just lost a customer!""

The old guy stormed out of the store and back to his car and drove off, forgetting to close his gas cap.

This is the first time a customer has really gotten to me. I already get the occasional ""immigrants stealing out jobs"" because I'm half Middle-Eastern (born in Canada by the way), but just the fact he didn't give a shit that someone like him killed a young guy because they didn't want to follow the rules really made me mad. Both me and my coworker were really mad for the rest of our shift, thankfully the rest of the customers today were generally nice.

I have loads of stories to tell about the stupidity of customers and their delusions, but this is the most recent. I had electricians in-store last week to fix the AC. My store shuts at 8pm, so they guys turn up then and start unloading their equipment. We have high ceilings so they need to use a cherry picker. It needs to come in the front door so I open them nice and wide. The machine is halfway through, basically blocking the door, when a couple try to get in. They are both fatties, so it was a squeeze. I catch them quickly but they have already begun to browse. I had to explain we are not open, the doors were open for the cherry picker. The reply? ""We will only be a few minutes."" Eh, whit. It is almost 9pm, it is dark and there are no lights on in my store. No we are not open, get out. They leave, in a huff.

crickey23,39,,153,1keyxl,,442,"Third post here! I hope you guys are enjoying my stories so far.

A little background to this story: We just got a new part timer in our department and even though she's been here about two weeks yesterday was the first time I've met her. She witnessed this whole thing go down and hopefully she doesn't think this happens often.

Yesterday at the shoe department it was pretty bonkers; tons of clearance going on so I had a lot of customers wanting shoes and I was by myself until 45 minutes before my shift ended. New girl, who I'll call NG from here, had just gotten in but I was helping a customer so I hadn't really gotten to chat. After I left the customer, a teenage girl, I go talk to NG. Halfway through finally introducing myself we see this kid bolting down the front center aisle of the accessories department, yelling ""I didn't steal nothing!"" followed by our two LP officers charging after him at full speed. The kid was carrying a backpack full of Polo shirts and dropped it while he was running. After they turn the corner me and NG and another customer start chatting about what happened. A few seconds later a couple other kids (one carrying a Victoria's Secret bag--an important detail) cut through our department, heading toward the direction the other kid was running. I saw in my most threatening, authoritative voice, ""Are you with the kid who just ran by here?"" They denied it, acting like I was crazy but I knew full well they were. I can't do anything to them so I let them go.

A couple minutes later the teenage girl I was helping before the incident comes up to me and tells me that one of the two kids who walked by stole her Victoria's Secret bag! At this point I see them walk toward the front exit so I follow after them. 

Now as most of you fellow retailers know you just can't tackle someone on probable cause (or at all, unfortunately), so I follow closely behind. I call out to them but the keep walking. Once they leave the store I can't follow anymore so I turn around and go back to my department. I feel like a jerk at this point for letting them get away and tell the teenager I'll have to get a hold of security about it.

The LP officers come around to accessories a couple seconds later, huffing and puffing and I tell them what happened. They go talk to the girl and mall security gets involved. All the while I'm standing there like an idiot because I let some kids get away with theft right under my nose.

Later after all the info is taken about the incident the teenager and her mother return to the shoe department and I apologize a million times. They say it's ok, it was only a couple of t-shirts. I tell them that the girl who stole the shirts is probably going to be disappointed because she's a little too fat to be wearing size small shirts. They laughed and thanked me and though I still feel a little guilty I think I made their day a tiny bit better.

So, within the first 45 minutes of meeting me NG got to watch an attempted robbery and a definite robbery. I told her after all was said and done that things like that don't happen too often. She seemed like she enjoyed the specticle and hopefully she likes me and working in the shoe department.","""That girl just stole my bag!""",595,talesFromRetail

At my store we sell  furniture as well as accessories and other odds and ends related to home furnishing. The other day while walking the floor I noticed a woman, probably in her mid 50's, looking at some of our tins of wood stain. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her reach onto the counter, pick up a clear bottle of a clear varnish/lacquer sort of thing and then open and drink straight from the bottle.

After a huge gulp her face changes. She begins screaming about how it wasn't water. Soon the woman sees me and stomps over in my general direction. At this point she's right pissed. She screams that the store tricked her into thinking that bottle was water. She's going to sue. She wants to talk to a manager and get whoever stocked the varnish fired.

Unfortunately for the customer the card had declined due incorrectly typing their PIN 3 times in a row sometime within the last 24 hours.

The conversation to try and explain the situation is as follows:

Me: I am sorry but your card has declined due to you putting your PIN incorrectly 3 times in a row sometime in the last 24 hours. You won't be able to use your card until after 24 hours since you incorrectly entered PIN in.

Customer: What?

Me: Sometime in the last 24 hours you have incorrectly put in your PIN 3 times in a row. You can not use your card.

Customer: But I have $14,000 in my bank account

Me: But your card is locked, you can't access the funds from your card. You are going to need to go to the bank to access your money.

I then saw his hand move towards the cigarettes, which I was holding on to. So I quickly snatched my hand back with the cigarettes and said ""You can not have the cigarettes, you have not paid for them.""

crystall,112,,91,1pk83x,,444,"I was reminded of this story of my time working at a certain international, coffee shop chain, by another post. This was actually my comment to their post, but I have been lurking here so long now, commenting occasionally, that I thought I would share this with you all. 

Working the same shift in a downtown area of a city, you see the same people at the same time every day. You get to know what your regulars order, this makes sense, yes. If we were slow and I saw a regular headed toward our doors, I would start on their beverage so that by the time they paid, it would be ready and waiting for them.

 Most people appreciated this; they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didn't have to stand around waiting/wasting their break time. Most people. 

This one guy, came in at 2pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same non-fat, vanilla latte, EVERY DAY. I see him coming down the block, there are no customers, I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush, I stop what I am doing and start making his drink, so that just as my co-worker handed him his change, I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him, saying ""here's your non-fat, vanilla latte, sir."" He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him, gave me a death look and said, ""what is this?"" I repeated what I said, maintaining eye contact. ""When did you make this?"" he asked, incredulously. ""Just now,"" I stated, ""I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you."" I smiled, he was still giving me the death look. He picks up the cup, sniffs it, glares at me and walks out. 

Later on that day, my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr. non-fat, vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying, he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well. Nothing ever came of it. But every afternoon after that at 2pm, I would wait patiently until he ordered, until he paid, then I would painstakingly make his drink, taking as much time as possible and hand it off to him with a smile.

jessajuhanabi,130,,81,1fmzbp,,448,"So this happened to me the other day. I work for a small business that has two shops right next to each other. I work as a barista most days, with two shifts in the other store, where i'm a sales person and manager. We're in one of the most well off suburbs of Melbourne so sometimes we get rather entitled people. On this day I was working a cafe shift, with one other girl. 

So this older woman walks in, and thankfully, my coworker took her order and not me. Let's call her Fingers. You'll see why.

**Fingers:** I want a sandwich. 

**Coworker**: Okay, great what would you-

**Fingers:** I want it cut into fingers. Not those stupid squares you do. 

**Coworker:** Sorry... fingers?

**Fingers:** Yes. Cut into three (makes motion with her hand). Do you know how to do that, honey?

It may not seem like much but when she said, *""do you know how to do that?""* you could hear sarcasm dripping from her voice. I actually turned around from my spot at the coffee machine to look at my coworker to gauge her reaction. To her credit, she kept a straight face and soldiered on. 

So this lady eventually tells us whats in her sandwich and what she would like to drink. It's a tea.  I make it, and go to put it down and her paper is covering the entire table. She looks at me and makes no move to rearrange, so i put the tea on the edge of paper so it's easily moved, and start to walk away.

**Fingers:** No. You're going to pick that up while I move my paper. 

I'm a bit taken aback by how she said it, but alright, customer knows best. I pick it up and stand there... and keep standing there. She's situating her paper and she does not give a rats ass how long I have to stand there holding her tea. She finally gets everything where she wants it and looks up at me. I put down the tea and walk away, jimmies only slightly rustled.

As soon as i get back to the coffee machine, there she is. Holding her mug at the front counter. It has a few black specks. If you've ever been a barista, you know it's pretty much impossible not to have some coffee grounds around. They're harmless and you can brush them off.

**Fingers:** This is dirty.

**Me**: Oh, sorry, it's just a couple coffee grounds, we-

**Fingers**: Get me a new one. Don't give me excuses for your dirty dishware.

**Me**: Okay, sure I'll-

**Fingers**: And i want boiling water as well. (walks away)

I'm sort of flaberghasted at this point how bluntly rude she is, and her lovely habit of cutting people off, but okay. I'm not going to let it get to me. It's a slow day and I'm having an okay time.

I get a jug of water and a cup and set it to the side and finish the coffee I was doing, planning on walking them out together. Fingers has other plans. Ten seconds later she's back.

**Fingers**: Yeah, i wanted a new cup. Remember me?

**Me:** Yep, I was going to bring them out to you but if you want I can hand them- oh, you're already walking away, okay.

I go take out the water and mug. Here's where it gets good folks. I almost lost it. 

**Fingers**: No, i want another teapot of water. (taps tea) *Do you know what a teapot is, girl?*

I got her the teapot. I wanted to pour the teapot over her head, but i held off. Yeah, i work a shitty barista job to save money before I go back to school next year, but for the love of all that's holy, **don't you fucking act like you're better than me.**

Apparently when my coworker brought her the finger cut sandwich, she exclaimed *""This isn't what i wanted at all, but i suppose it will* **have** *to do.""*

I work at a home-deco/fabric store. In my department (fabrics) we have 6 rows of shelves to display the fabrics we have for sale. The first row is for the clearance/discount fabrics that we need to get rid of. the other 5 are for the regular priced items. Atop the large discount shelf sits a large sign that reads: ""CLEARANCE FABRICS, $2-10 DOLLARS PER METER *All prices are as marked"".

 Every now and then, some inconsiderate moron will take a bolt of the most expensive fabric we have (usually raw silk or velvet, which is on the opposite fucking end of the department), ogle at it for a little, maybe let his/her kids bite and piss on it, take it on a little stroll throughout the store, and leave it (unrolled, of course) on the bargain shelf. This is a story of what happens to naughty boys and girls that don't read the price tags and signs in stores.

This happened about a week ago. Dialogue is recreated from memory. Most of it is correct.

Enter, stage left: Mrs. Illiterate McFuckface and husband, Stubborn von Butterballs. 


Fuckface decides to browse our rather large selection of upholstery and dress fabrics, deciding that it needs to make a new dress or whatever the voices in hear head tell her to make. It lays it's eyes on the bolt of velvet, deciding that it's going to need a few meters of velvet for it's next creation. 

Lo and behold! The sleek, smooth, high-quality, elegant-looking, crimson bolt of velvet, gives off a soft, warm radiance, even under the cold, unforgiving, fluorescent ceiling-light. Like a diamond in the rough, it's (untidily) perched, next to the dirty, stained, torn, dusty-old bolt of bleached cotton. Quite a contrast, some might notice.

Discount shelf...

Velvet...

Velvet on discount shelf...

---

After expending it's mana reserves, the Fuckface has put two and two together! It has deduced that *because* the velvet on the discount shelf, it must *obviously* be on sale! To hell with the price tag that clearly says it's $50 per meter, it's on the discount shelf! This must be her lucky day! Perhaps the stars have aligned and have given her the big break she needs!

It commands it's brood-mate, Stubborn von Butterballs to transport the material for her, as she is obviously too important for such simple tasks. Without hesitation the drone uses it's grubby little arms to carry the bolt of velvet to the payment/cutting counter. As it lays the bolt on the counter, Fuckface says with a silver of triumph in it's voice: ""I want five meters of this"".

Like all the other good employees, I process her request, scan her fabric, and total up her purchase.

---

&gt;""That'll be two hundred and fifty dollars, ma'am"" I say with a semi-forced smile on my face.

&gt;""No. You've scanned it wrong, this was on the discount shelf"" it replies.

&gt;""No madam, that was incorrectly placed. I can see why you'd mistake this for a discounted item, but still, it clearly indicates on the price tag that it's $50 dollars per meter. I'm sorry, this happens every now and then, I'd be happy to give you 5% off for your trouble if you'd like.""

Unable to process the information given, the Fuckface replies: ""No, this isnt two hundred dollars, it was on the discount shelf.""

&gt;""Madam, the sign on the shelf states that all prices are as marked. Even if this *was* on sale, I'd still have to charge you according to the price tag. If you don't want to pay for this, we have some similar materials that are a little cheaper."" 

&gt;""THE DISCOUNT SHELF SIGN SAYS FABRICS THERE ARE TWO TO TEN DOLLARS PER METER. I WANT THIS AND I'M NOT FUCKING PAYING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THIS."" It replies, confused and infuriated

&gt;""The sign *also* says that prices are as marked.""

Confused, irritated, and unsure of what to do next, the Fuckface musters up the energy to follow whatever instruction it's simple brain tells it to do.

Fuckface used Mating Call!

It wails for it's significant other to come to it's aid, till suddenly, a wild Stubborn von Butterballs appears!

&gt;""THIS FABRIC WAS ON THE DISCOUNT SHELF. THIS BOY WONT SELL IT TO ME FOR CHEAP"" it screams to it's partner.

Obviously enraged by this, the muscle-bound oaf storms towards the counter.

&gt;""WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER? I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW.""

&gt;""I'll call him right away! I'll be right back, sir!"" I reply, with a smug grin on my face

I scurry to the intercom like a child on Christmas morning, and page for my manager to come. Like a knight in shining armor, my manager arrives to the rescue. There's already quite a wall of text here, so I'll spare you the repeat conversation that occured.

Back and forth, like three warriors in a heated battle, the angry couple relentlessly spammed: ""It Was On The Discount Shelf"", while my manager replied with the super-effectve: ""Read The Sign"", occasionally re-enforcing our defences with: ""Sorry, We Can Still Give You A Discount"". By this point, a small crowd of people had paused their adventure in the mall to watch the bloody battle. Some of them even tried defending us, but for all their efforts, all they got was an angry: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP STAY OUT OF THIS"", by the savages. Things finally came to a close when my manager had to drop the nuke and call security.

---

After about four minutes of verbal ping-pong, my manager paged for mall security. Three burly, intimidating security guards arrived to *escort* the Neanderthals out of the store. Instead of thanking their escorts, all  they received were a bunch of barely comprehensible death and lawsuit threats.

The crowd of people started applauding and cheering, as Fuckface and it's drone walked out of the store, sulking in defeat. It's final words were: ""IM GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THIS FUCKING STORE JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE YOULL ALL BE FUCKING JOBLESS WHEN IM DONE WITH YOU"". Eyes were rolled and groans were groaned, when out of nowhere, a teenage boy yelled just out of earshot: ""THE PRICE TAGS ARE THERE FOR A FUCKING REASON, LADY!""

All in all, the battle was won, and the fight was over. The crowd, my manager, and myself, all retreated into the staff room to revel in mead and song, and we all lived happily ever after.

I worked on a gas station, and we just started using this new system where you had to pay before you could fill gas on your car.

This particular day was nothing out of the ordinary. That was untill this costumer showed up. A middle-aged woman that looked distressed. 

I asked her what was up, and she said that her car had run out of fuel and couldn't refill it. Her credit card had been blocked and she had no cash. She still had 100 km home, so she really needed gas. 

I tried my best to help her - asking my boss if we could release a pump and let her pay later - but there was nothing. Unless, of course, I paid for her gas out of my own pocket. 

I may be a bit naive and trusty, but I really wanted to help her. So I explained to her that I would pay for her gas myself and gave her my information so she could transfer the money to me when she got home. It ended up being like $10 worth of gas. Not a huge loss, but still not something I feel comfortable with trusting to a total stranger.

She thanked me profoundly and went on her way. A few days later, I checked my bank account, and I had received a transfer of $30 with a note saying ""thanks!"". 

Even though $20 is not huge or anything, it has got to be the most heartwarming 20 dollars I've earned.

Perhaps only a description will do it justice. She was like...400 pounds. Her two toddler children were screaming in close vicinity. All the while she was speaking loudly on her cellular device. 

While the ""'Murica"" radiating from her appearance may have been one thing, her actions truly solidified her spot in my retail bullshit hall of fame. It takes an amateur customer to be mildly rude, a professional to demand special treatment, and a seasoned veteran to cause a scene.

But it takes a superstar, a customer in a class of their own, to commit a retail feat of this caliber. Chatting on the phone loudly, riding in her electric cart, ignoring her two screaming toddlers, the bitch weaved through the aisles of DVDs without a care in the world. So much so that she neglected to maintain the basic spatial awareness to situate herself in space and time.

A deafening blast of metal upon metal echoed throughout the store. I jumped at the initial sound of it. My fears were only heightened when the sound repeated itself shortly thereafter. Was that a gun? Did someone get hurt?

tehtreats,57,,154,1ormqr,,440,"[UPDATED]TFR, after 10 years of dealing with customers, I would not believe the story I am about to tell (it's a long one, folks.)

**Background:** I work at a hardware store in the middle of a big city. I've been at this store since it opened a bit over four years ago and have climbed our tiny franchise ladder to assistant manager. Due to our location, our customers are composed of every walk of life - from those who carry all their worldly possessions on their back to those who have a half-a-million dollar view as a vacation home. As a young, attractive female, I get to deal with a very special breed of creeps and assholes.  Needless to say, I deal with *a lot* of weird shit.  I get to meet a lot of really interesting/cool/awesome people, too . 


**Just another ordinary day? No.** It's another beautiful day in the city and I'm standing near the front doors at the paint desk, working on reports n stuff.  One of the sales guys is lurking nearby, waiting for the next customer to stroll in. 


This fella walks in and notices our bag policy sign near the bargain bins. In his late 30's to early 40's and something about him says Biff from Back to the Future. Maybe it was the bowler shirt. Anyhow. He walks right up to me and hands off his shopping bag, saying he noticed the sign. I thank him earnestly as most people put up a fight about leaving their bag up front. 


(Sidenote: for the love of the gods I do not give **fuck** about what it is in your backpack/shopping bag/rolling luggage. It needs to go behind the register because we are not about to babysit you for the duration of your visit. Yes, some asshole ruined it for everyone else. Yes, I'm okay with losing a customer over it.)


I digress. He drops this bag with me and walks off with the sales guy in search of a battery for an RC car that I know we don't have (might as well let him see some inventory.) As he does he says, ""Oh, and help yourself to something from there!"" It was then that I looked at the bag and realized it was from Fredrick's. Of Hollywood. The delightfully naughty lingerie shop. 


Immediate dafuq.


I take the shopping bag over towards the registers (where they go) and start looking for this battery through our ordering site. We have a pretty decent selection made available to us through a third party and I'm just trying to figure the best way to search for it when he comes back up front. 


Again he offers me something from the bag. At first I laugh and give the standard, ""Oh that's alright, but thanks. Now let me see if we can find this battery....""


He then goes on to explain that they are for a scavenger hunt taking place in a few nights and it's the least he could do for my efforts since the last few places just said ""we don't have those"" and sent him on his way. At this point I thought *fuck it* and rifled through the bag. Save the embarrassment of pulling out a pair of sexy underwear out in front of staff, customers, and the like, I looked for a tag that was my size, balled them up, and stuffed them in my apron. 


We laughed about it as he gave me a business card so I could follow up and let him know if I could find the battery in time. I did and it might actually have landed me a lucrative job opportunity. Happy to post about it for those interested, but not sure if it's still appropriate for this sub?

***Clarification edits:***


**More about the scavenger hunt:** This is a local underground scavenger hunt. It is in it's beginning phases and is a pretty cool concept.


Local artists, musicians, crafters, growers (yes, that kind) and other creative talent come together and provide arts, gifts, and services for profit from participation.


Hunt takes place every full moon at a random location in the city. You sign up through their site and are added to an email list that informs you of the spot. Participants pay $20 for entry and are given a token (a simple little plastic container with a neat picture on top, of which there are many varieties), a map, and a gram of weed (for those with medicinal marijuana licenses.) Tokens are collected based on the map and clues and traded for the aforementioned prizes, in addition to things like tickets to the local amusement parks, restaurant vouchers. You'll find gift bags on the hunt with things like bubbles, *panties,* small pieces of artwork, and a handful of tokens.


**The battery:** Was for an RC car that was somehow incorporated into the hunt. I'm not sure exactly how, but yeah.


So no, it really wasn't that creepy or weird. And as I mentioned in the background up top there, I deal with a lot of bizarre things. One of these days I'll post about the guy who cut his throat in the front of our store.


In the meantime I need to deliver on how this might have landed me a rad job opportunity.

Vocal_Toad,86,,90,1c1rm4,,447,"**BACKGROUND:** *I'm a member of store management. I've worked in retail for nearly 20 years. I have deep, deep scars.*

**THE TALE:** So this was few years back. My kid was diagnosed with cancer. I did not tell my boss, a known dickhead, right away. Instead, I filled out the FMLA paperwork first and he found out a few days later when approval was sent from HR. So I'm all set with intermittent leave and a butt-load of banked sick time. It has to be intermittent, because I have no earthly idea when I need to be gone or for how long. If you've ever had a family member with cancer, you know there's surgeries, chemo, unexplained fevers, calls from school, etc. And this is my kid, so, you know I'm going to be there for everything.

(Also kind of important: I'm divorced, and my kid lives primarily with his mom.)

So it's all fine. My coworkers bend over backwards for the me while I'm away for chemo, surgeries, and other scheduled stuff. As it happens, my kid gets sick with a high fever. We think it's an infection, so off to the hospital we go for an assured overnight (at least). Dutifully, I call the boss and let him know what's going on. 

""OkaaaAAAY,"" he whines, ""Call me in a few hours and let me know what's going on.""

""Well, honestly I'm going to be out today. My kid has to be here overnight, so I'm staying.""

""Well, call me back later and we'll talk about it,"" he says.

""Fine. Whatever.""

So, as predicted, nothing has miraculously changed in two hours, so I call back, ""He's still here. The doctors think it's an infection, but they don't know for sure. I won't be coming in. I'll let someone know ASAP if I need to be out tomorrow, but it would help if you could cover me just in case. I want the others to have more than a few hours notice if they have to change their shifts.""

There's a small, but significant pause, ""We get truck tomorrow.""

This is not an unexpected response from the known dickhead, but even so, I find myself barely containing my rage, ""Yes. I know that. What would you have me do?""

""We need you. It's warehouse day,"" he says.

""Listen: I think I need to be clear about something. If my kid is in the hospital, I am in the hospital. Warehouse day, or no."" I'm not known for my ultimatums. Parenthood does that.

Another pause.

""Fine. Call me tomorrow morning.""

""Fine,"" I say.

My kid ended up staying three days. I was with him the whole time.

One day I got a call from a gentleman who was getting a bill from his doctor, and wanted to know why we didn't pay it. Well, the doctor was not in our network, so when that happens we give the customer the option of having payment sent directly to them instead of their doctor, since they often have to pay up front for services. I checked his claim, and sure enough, we had already paid him in full for this bill. It was somewhere around $900. He said he had never received the check, so I looked, and it had been cashed a few months back. I looked at the image of the cashed check and told him his signature was on it and it had been cashed. I told him if he didn't cash it, I could initiate a check-fraud investigation for him. As usual, though, I was pretty certain he had cashed the check and just didn't remember. This is the case 99.9% of time. 
Finally, he realized he did in fact cash that check. He didn't know that it was intended to pay that bill, though, and had spent the money on other things. Now, I feel like I should mention that the checks are sent with a copy of the claim, showing exactly what dates and services the check is for. But sure...he had no idea. That's fine. I'm thinking now that he realizes what happened, this call is done and I can go home (call came in 2 minutes before my shift was over-love that). But no. He then asked if I would be RESENDING a check for that amount to pay this bill. What?
 Um no, sir, we already paid for this. You received the money. That's it for us. 
Him: well, yes, but I spent that money already, and still have this bill to pay. You need to pay this bill. You're my insurance company. 

I was literally speechless for a moment. Wtf kind of logic is this???? I was on the phone with him for an HOUR going back and forth trying to get through his head that this makes less than zero sense. People boggle my mind sometimes.

For reference, I work in a retail store where the blue light shines bright.

&gt;Yesterday a woman came through my checkout with her two kids, a teen girl and a boy who looked around 10 years old. The boy ended new shoes, and they thought they could get then buy one get them half off, but one of the pairs they picked out wasn't included. They checked out and the boy was sad because he'd have to continue playing in his ratty shoes and saving the other for school. 

&gt;When their receipt printed out, they got a ""$10 family shoes *with a purchase of $50 or more"" coupon. They were so excited, but then they realized that they couldn't spend $50, obviously. The lady behind them had been waiting patiently for me to get them all check out, and she saw the coupon. She told the little boy to run back and get his shoes, and she used the coupon in her purchase (which ended up being like $62~something), and the mom gave her the money to finish covering the shoes ($8). It was seriously the most heart warming thing ever. 

&gt;When the family left, the woman paid and said ""I just can't stand the thought of that little boy playing in those shoes any more. My sons had to do that, and I wish someone had helped us."" I wanted to give her like, the world's biggest hug. It was awesome.

Hammerfist_Pucconi,92,,91,1j2bih,,440,"I worked in a thrift store in the...not so nice part of my city. It was a really good job, and I met some really great people. However, I also met some pretty awful people. I will share one of the lesser cases with you here.

First things first, I'm half Nicaraguan, but I don't look it. I didn't learn much Spanish as a child, but whenever my dad's family would visit, I would practice. I also took seven years of Spanish in school, so I have a pretty solid handle on it.

Back to the story

In the thrift store, there were only usually two people working. Upon closing, one would take the drawers and count out the deposit while the other vacuumed, straightened, and swept. On this particular night, I was working with the manager, so when we closed, she took the drawer back, and I started vacuuming. The front of our store is floor-to-ceiling windows, and I can see a group of people approaching the door. All Hispanic, there was a man, his wife, their little daughter, and an older woman. I assume she was the grandmother for the sake of the story.

I will say here that the worst feeling in the world is looking someone in the eye as they try and open a door. Because then they look stupid and they know you know they look stupid and you know that they know and so on. I hate that.

So I turn my back as they approach so I don't have to see them try and fail to enter. But when I turn around, they've opened the door. The fuck?

Turns out, my manager thought I locked the door, while I thought she locked it. So I'm tasked with the wonderful duty of telling these people they can't do the exact thing they've just done. Nobody likes being told they can't do the exact thing they've just done.

Me: ""Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! That door should've been locked! We're actually closed.""

Dad: ""Oh...ok...""

Grandma: ""Que paso?"" [What's up?]

Dad: ""Este cabron no va a dejarnos entrar."" [This bastard isn't gonna let us in.]

At this point, I am excited. I love when people don't know I can understand them.

Me: ""Debes saber que hablo espanol..."" [You should know that I speak Spanish...]

I grab the door that he's holding and slowly pull it closed, locking it as loudly as I could. He started to become visibly angry that I had the nerve to close the door in his face, and then I saw as it all clicked in his head, and he just kind of backed away.

nose_twitch,38,,77,19pcur,,441,"I work in a grocery store deli that is big on our fried chicken. We use large pressure fryers that have a long trough for collecting runoff water from the chicken. While they do not have to be changed after every fry it is important to empty them before you start frying and afterwards to prevent them from overflowing on to the floor which makes a disgusting greasy mess.

So its Sunday afternoon and I am getting ready to start frying. We have two fryers that differ slightly and I normally use the middle one. I get everything set up for my first fry and go down to empty the water trough. I barely move it before greasy nasty water comes pouring out of it over my hands. For it to get this full means that no one has emptied it in days. Once it gets this full it is impossible to empty it without making a huge mess. Needless to say I was pissed. This isn't the first time my lazy coworkers have left this mess for me.

I decided enough was enough. I looked at our fry log sheet and see that that same coworker (Moody) has used that fry for the past four days. I get out a pen and paper and make a nice big note and write

""Empty your water tray. Don't just leave your mess for others""

I stick it on the fridge, slide the overflowing water tray back into the fryer, and use the other one for my chicken that day (it was not overflowing so I could actually empty it).

The next day I go into work and notice my note had been taken down off the fridge. I mention it to my coworker and she says that she never saw a note this morning and that Moody or the Manager must have taken it down. I told her what my note said and what had happened the previous day. She then tells me what had happened that morning.

When Moody and the Manager came in for the day they presumably read my note. Moody then uses the same fryer that she had all the previous days. Doesn't check the water trough, which I had not emptied. Fried her chicken, and the water overflowed into huge mess all ,over the floor.

dairyqueenlatifah,114,,117,15ayyj,,438,"The amount of people that don't think about how rude it is to be on your phone in a store is seriously overwhelming.

Normally when a customer walks into my shop I greet them and ask if they need help finding anything. If someone on their phone comes in I just don't even acknowledge them.

Today I had a woman with her sister and ~20 year old daughter. I had already rung up the sister's transaction and she stepped up to purchase her item separately. She only had one little shirt. Just one item. During this transaction of ONE item, she decides that she just cannot wait to call her friend back about their plans for Sunday night. She completely ignored my prompts (the customer has to choose yes or no to donate for a charity before the computer system will let me ring out the purchase), so I decided I wasn't going to talk to her anymore. Just to save my own ass, I said ""your total is $5.14"" and just stared at her. 

I stared right at her face for about a full minute while she was planning her dinner at Granite City with Julia and Max. The younger girl tried to get her attention by saying the total to her but even that didnt work. I could tell the younger girl was getting embarrassed so she apologized to me and tried to take the money out of the lady's hand to pay me. 

This is when the dumb old bitch finally got the clue that it was time to pay. She said to her friend, ""hold on. Apparently I  have to pay"" in a voice that was pretty clear she thought I was a total bitch for not helping her. She looks down at the PIN pad and says ""my total is $5.14?""  and I say ""sure is.""

So at this point she knows I'm going out of my way to be a bitch to her and she dumps her coin purse on my counter and expects me to pick 14 cents out of it. No, lady, I don't think so. So I continued to stare at her. Right in her face, for the entire duration of her phone call. She got the hint and threw 14 cents and a 5 dollar bill at me, so I threw her receipt in her bag, purposely did not give her promotional coupons, and shoved the bag at her without saying ""have a nice day.""

Theneoalchemist,60,,154,1nb4p0,,441,"A couple years ago I worked at a department store. One of the main problems with the store I worked on was that the managers were mainly concerned with looking good to corporate and the way they would do that was by short staffing the store in order to keep costs down. 

We had 8 departments and 2 sets of registers. Each department was supposed to have 2 people to close the store and each set of registers was to have 1 person at close (if it got busy register associates would call for help from the floor associates), so at minimum we were supposed to have about 18 people on the sales floor when closing. 

With the managers trying to lower cost an average night would consist of about 8-10 people. Also the manager on duty (store or assistant) would usually spend the whole night in there office, only coming out in order to criticize employees on how long they were taking to clean their areas, not paying attention to us being half staffed as well as busy.

So on this one particular night I was on the registers for a closing shift. Once again we were short staffed, but it was particularly bad because the store was having a big sale. Well I guess the assistant manager had plans for the night because she pulled the other cashier off the register and had them work on helping to clean the sales floor. So I was the only one on register and eventually I had about 5 customers in my line. Following protocol I called for backup, 10 minutes later and with 10 customers waiting in my line I called for backup again. It was at this point that my manager calls my phone from her office and says ""Look, there is no backup, your on your own, deal with it"" and than she hung up (she didn't like me that much lol). 

It was at this point that I looked at the line full of angry people and said ""Hi everyone, I'm sorry for the wait, as a way to compensate you for your time everyone currently in line will get 20% off their purchase"" (We were only allowed to give 15% at most if customers didn't have a coupon, and if we gave 15% we were supposed to have a really good reason). 

In the end all the customers in line thanked me and I never got in trouble for it. I'm sure LP understood the situation and my assistant manager was to self involved to ever notice all the discounts I gave that night. 

She was eventually transferred to one of our stores in the middle of no where. ","""There is no backup cashiers, your on your own, deal with it.""",595,talesFromRetail

The kind with loads of gently used 501 jeans, old prom dresses, dresses and skirts from the 50's, 60's and 70's, vintage suits, hawaiian shirts - ya know, things of that nature. For things like sweaters, short skirts, shirts, etc, we had those circular clothing racks that little kids would love to use as forts while their parents shopped. 

  One night, about ten minutes before closing time, a father comes in with his daughter, who was probably around 4 or 5 years old. They look around a bit, the little girl being a cute little bubbly thing who would say small child inanities to my co-workers and myself and who kept hiding then popping out of the circular clothing racks. 

  Just as they were about to leave, the little girl pipes up and says, ""WAIT!!""  She then runs to one of the circular clothing racks at the back of the store and hides in there. After about ten seconds or so, the dad started getting pissy about his daughters antics, telling her that it was time to go, etc etc. She finally pops out, looking bashful, and says directly to me and my co-worker, ""I´m sorry."" I smile at her, tell her it is ok, shoo them out the door and lock up after them.

I'd only been working here for about a month, still in training, mainly busing tables, washing dishes, doing prep etc. Real basic stuff, but management is kind of lazy when it comes to training. They're good people though and treat all the customers and employees like family. It's very close knit.

Up until this point, I hadn't really had any customer interaction though. If the phones were ringing, or I happened to walk by a customer I was just suppose to say hi, or put them on hold, and then get someone else to take care of them. Sure, I wanted to start doing more than just basic noob shit, but at the same time I wasn't going to complain. On a busy Friday/Saturday I'm more than happy to just chill in the back and do some dishes.

Anyways, the other night was my lucky night. I was going to start doing ""food runs"". Basically, people's food comes out, the pizza cutter gives you a ticket with their food, you find their table and serve them their food. Simple right? Of course on my first run I fuck up horribly.

I find the table, it's an older couple, maybe late 50s/early 60s. Now pizza trays are kind of slippery with all the grease under them, so as I go to set it down the pizza starts to slide off the tray and lands on the table. Total noob mistake.

All three of us just kind of stare at the pizza, half sitting on the tray, half sitting on the table. I try to make light of it with a ""Well...this is awkward"" and the guy makes some sarcastic passive aggressive smart-ass comment about it.

I realize their a little upset, so I apologize. I tell them it's my first time, I totally botched it. If they want I'd be more than happy to have it remade ASAP (so no wait) and have another server bring it out to them to ensure this doesn't happen again, and they aren't further inconvenienced.

This seems to lighten their mood and they seem okay. They smile and say ""Oh no, that's okay! It's a mistake, no big deal! Thank you though!"" Okay great, problem solved.

I head back into the kitchen and my manager asks how it goes. I tell her and she just laughs. Apparently everyone there has fucked up before. One guy (a manager), even knocked a guy's drink on to him. But she appreciated that I took control of the situation and offered to fix it for them, and that I did everything right, and it'll just take me a few more tries to get the hang of it.

A few minutes after finishing our conversation the lady comes over, now furious. She tries to get my manager's attention. ""Ma'am! Ma'am! I have a complaint. Your EMPLOYEE just dropped our pizza and it got all over our table. Then he proceeded to just laugh about it and walk away. That's disgusting and very rude. We're not eating that, and I want it remade.""

My manager responds: ""Well, I'm sorry about that ma'am, and I'll be happy to remake it for you. And I already talked to my employee about it as it was his first time, to see how everything went. From what he told me it was an accident and he offered to remake it but you guys said it was okay.""

She responds: ""No that's not what happened. He just tossed our pizza on to the table. Said ""oops"" and laughed about it and just walked away.""

My manager responds: ""Well I'm very sorry. I was just making sure, because we could have started remaking it minutes ago so you wouldn't have to have been waiting as long. We'll take care of it though.""

Lady walks away and I look at my manager like ""seriously?"" She looks at me and says ""Fuck that bitch. You know what? She can wait.""

I go back out, pick up their ""disgusting pizza"" apologize again, and bring it back to the kitchen...where myself and all the employees proceed to eat it right in front of them. They look pissed, but they end up even more pissed when it takes us another 30 minutes to ""remake"" their pizza. 

Hey, it happens. Sometimes tickets get ""mixed up"". Or people call ahead of time so their's ends up ""taking priority"". Or the ovens get too full so some pizzas have to ""wait"" or get ""forgotten"" for a couple of minutes. Apparently, a lot of things can happen in a pizza restaurant.

So back when I was in high school, acter I rage quit O'Fastfoodigan's, I decided it was time to take up a more white-collar profession: grocery store cashier. Perfect timing, as a new grocery store was just about to open near my neighborhood. So I put together my ridiculously overdone resume for a 16 year old, complete with personal references, volunteer experience, h.s. GPA- all kinds of stuff that doesn't matter in retrospect. Got the job! 

Anyways, within a few months' time, I became to cashiering, what a korean kid is to Starcraft gaming. Super fast, super accurate, all while perfecting the fake-nicety that makes the old ladies' knees buckle. TL;DR, I was awesome at what I did.

Management, however, as I would learn in life, didn't care. This was MegaFoodCorp; nobody noticed. It was a great life lesson, really. I was the lowest of the low. Just some kid slingin' boxes and bags. And in this WASPy area, I was to take whatever shit the customers wanted to dish out and say 'please sir, may I have anova'?

And so slowly over the months, my dignity-tail ever further between my legs, ever biting my tongue, I soldiered on. Until one day I finally decided to take a stand!

It was late for me, approaching the 10pm end of my shift. Tired from school and six hours of scanning and smiling, I shut off my light. Two more medium-sized orders of cereal and 4011 and ahh fuck WIC; and it's be time to count down my drawer, take off my clip-on tie, and go home. The light at the end of the tunnel! I ring up the one order, and am halfway through the next, when this middle-aged d-bag wearing the bluetooth earpiece of the day- the single earphone clipped to his polo shirt- conversing loudly with someone on the other end, rolls his fully-loaded cart up to my register.

""Excuse me, sir"" I firmy but politely say, ""I'm closed, she can help you in the next aisle"".
""No, you're NOT!"", he exclaimed loudly, continuing to unload his cart. I reiterated my previous statement more firmly, and retail-apologized to him. They teach you this in their training: never say 'I'm sorry' because it is admitting fault, but instead say 'I apologize'.

That was it. I had had enough of these nouveau riche dirtbags walking all over me just because they're in a position of power over me.

One night, as my coworker finished cleaning, she asked if she could leave. My boss told her not until she puts the 2 litre pop into the fridge.

Now, these 2 litre pop come on containers that fit 8, and while this doesn't seem like much to me, the constant lifting and carrying these really hurts my coworker. So she told my boss that she had scoliosis and couldn't carry it. My boss's reaction? ""NO EXCUSE"".

heheimrad,43,,103,169dez,,437,"I work at a very large bookstore, doing a little bit of everything. Cashiering, cafe, music seller, you name it and I can probably do it. Mostly, I work at the customer service desk where our job is to see if we have the book in stock, and then take the customer to it. Over last holiday season, the neighboring competitor bookstore had just gone bankrupt and closed, resulting in a lot more people in our store. This story occurs just as I had gotten off my shift.

It was very busy and I had to order a book. Since we're not allowed to order books for ourselves, I was standing on line at customer service waiting for a free coworker. Now, the coworker that had relieved me has a sort of mental disability and while she can get the job done, it often takes her a lot longer. She also looks and dresses a little weird, but she is a very nice person when you talk to her.

Since I was no longer on shift, I had my jacket on and nametag off. There was one lady in front of me and I could see her getting uppity at how long my coworker was taking (keep in mind, this lady did not know I worked there). She turned to me and opened her mouth, and I knew it was going to get ugly:

Self-entitled lady: Can you believe this place? Look at the quality of people that they hire. I can't stand around all day waiting for this RETARD to help me

Me: Excuse me ma'am? What did you just say?

Lady: The people that work here are so weird and this girl can't even help herself, let alone others.

Me (silently fuming, realizing I have no nametag on): Listen, I don't know who you think you are to call who is going to HELP you a retard, but if you ever talk about one of my coworkers that way again I will get my manager down here and get you thrown out. Have a very merry christmas. 

The lady turns red in the face, starts mumbling about how much money she spends here (never seen her before), and how she refuses to be treated like this. She gets off the line and goes upstairs to find the book herself. I go up to my coworker who was none the wiser, order my book in about 2 seconds, and leave.",A small victory for a bookstore worker,540,talesFromRetail
pibbsman,31,,70,14pzqv,,438,"So another story from my days in retail popped into my head this morning that I can't believe I haven't shared as of yet. In my days working at the big blue electronics retailer, I worked in a couple different stores, one being in a mall in a large college town in New England. Other than the colleges, the area was rather dumpy and we had a good amount of theft that happened in the store, so for the most part, the employees were rather vigilant. I worked in a large appliance department next to the rest rooms and break area. 

On Halloween one year, the managers all decided for a morale boost to allow all the employees to come to work in costume for the day. It was a fun time, and there were some great costumes. I had class before my shift, so I didn't have time to get changed. This comes in later.

So I'm working my shift, and as expected it's pretty slow. I see a few high school kids walking around shopping for cds with a bag from the mall, and I notice one of the kids grab a cd (nothing wrong with that), and then the group starts walking towards the bathroom, but only the one with the cd goes in, and the other two stand outside the area. I call our LP officer, and follow him into the bathroom.

Now because the break room door is directly across from the men's door, I pretend to be walking into the break room to fool the first two kids, and then redirect to the bathroom. He's the only person in there, with his feet pointed towards the toilet. All I can hear is the distinct sound of the wrapper on the cd peeling off. I look under the stall, and it hits the floor. So I stand in front of the stall door, grab the top and pull myself up. I see the back of the kid, cd in hand. As I hold myself up, I say ""You know kid, if you were trying to steal from us, you could of at least pretended like you were going to take a crap."" He turns around, bright red, oblivious to the fact that he got caught red handed. He comes out of the stall, with all of the evidence in hand. He then says to me ""Come on man, I can't get caught again."" I respond with ""Again? wrong answer!"" 

So we walk out of the bathroom, and we've got two managers and the LP supervisor waiting. All in costume. So I hand this kid over to Barbie, a milk carton and a vampire to go into the LP office. Before they move, another one of the employees dressed as Captain America (shield and all) comes walking up asking if he can be of any assistance. 

Needless to say, it was an interesting day.",You should at least pretend to take a crap. ,508,talesFromRetail
sjmoore,79,,89,1ia5pf,,436,"Sometimes, I really don't think our customers understand what SELF checkout means. I get a lot of this in my lanes: 1) ""Can you just take the hand scanner and zap all these items for me? I don't want to pick them all up ya know?"" No, fuck off to a cashier. 

2) Also, I don't know what magical powers you think this little hand scanner has, but when you're in the self checkout LINE, don't ask me if I can scan your items while you wait. Obviously not. How would you pay? By swiping your card through my asscrack? Just wait a minute.

3) Speaking of which, there are GIGANTIC signs above the registers and small ones ON the registers saying ""credit/debit/gift card only. NO checks, NO cash, NO bottle slips, NO reward checks"", so don't get mad at me when you spend your time ringing all those items and I say no cash. It's your fault for being unobservant, not mine for not being magical.

4) Sometimes if the cashiers have crazy long lines and self scan is slow, I'll call people over, and more than once I've gotten this: ""I'll only go over there if YOU'LL do it for me."" No, I was offering members with smaller orders to disperse to the self scan where there isn't a wait time, not offering to hand scan all of your giant items cause you don't wanna wait for a cashier.

5) Then there's the people who forgot something. ""Can you run back and get me x and y? I forgot them"" No. Do you see how often I get called over to these registers for ID checks and register issues? I can't abandon all the other customers because you forgot to get some damn bread. Use your eyes and brain and figure it out. And don't you leave your items/order up and run back there to get it. The world doesn't revolve around you and other people are waiting. Pay out this order and start a new one after you grab your item.

6) Which brings me to another issue - I don't have any beef with people buying alcohol through the self checkout, but don't you goddamn dare get mad when I'm not immediately free to approve that you're 21. YOU KNEW someone would have to check your ID/face regardless of age because it's a MACHINE and not a person with their full, undivided attention on you. If you didn't want to wait for that, you should've gone to a cashier. Period.

7) And the wait times. There's 4 registers and 1 clerk. If you need a clerk and your register light is blinking and you SEE ME with another customer, don't fucking ""M'am, m'am, M'AM I NEED HELP M'AM"" me. I KNOW. BUT YOU AREN'T NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST. Also, when I walk past your register to the person behind you who paged me first, don't throw a fit. I go in order of who's been waiting longest, not who cries the loudest/stands the closest. 

8) Last but not least, I know machines aren't perfect and they can be really frustrating at times. Especially our self checkout machines. If you accidentally lay anything else on the belt with an item, the belt takes the weight for the item wrong, and sends it back/voids it off your order so you have to rering it. I know that's annoying when you're in a rush. I'd love to help you cause I feel your rage. But don't be like the guy I had yesterday (the inspiration for my rage post):

Man: *sees me with another customer* M'AM. M'AM. JESUS CHRIST M'AM ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME? AT LEAST GET ANOTHER FUCKING CLERK.

Me: As you can see, I'm with someone else. I'm the only clerk and there is only one badge to work the machines here. Wait your turn.

Man: I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.

Me: Nor should this customer have to wait for me to help you. Just wait a second. *finish up, walk over to him*

Man: I'M DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT (direct quote) AND THE STUPID MACHINE STILL SENDS MY STUFF BACK. 

Me: *Looks at screen* sir, all of your items rang through just fine. Your raspberries got sent back one time and it looks like the second time around they went through just fine. You could have paid and left at any time.

Man: FUCK *places raspberries on belt*

*machine asks him to remove unrung items off the belt*

*he refuses, seems confused as to why the machine won't let him pay now*

Me: Sir, you can't leave the item on the belt, the machine has a scale in it and now thinks you're putting a new item you never rang into your basket.

Man: IS THIS OFF THE BELT ENOUGH FOR YOU?! *throws raspberries to end of line, where they smash open all over the place* NOW I NEED NEW RASPBERRIES. *stares at me angrily*

Me: You can go get yourself new ones as soon as you're done. I'm not going to do it. You're a grown man who just threw fruit and ruined it, and that is not my fault or my problem.

Man: FUCK YOU *storms out, not getting new berries*",8 glories of working the self checkout (A little angry/long),525,talesFromRetail
toxlab,57,,91,1o5u7h,,440,"I got a job in a hotel kitchen. It was nice. Very nice. 

Good menu, good equipment, and a professional staff that had a chef and a sous on every shift.

We got to rockstar it, too. At the end of our shift we could drop and run, and a cleaning crew would take care of sanitation and food storage. It was a plum gig. 

And then they sold the place.

They gave up the restaurant and the catering business to a grade A scumbag. He faked credentials to get the contract and had nothing but bravado on his side. 

The higher-ups in the restaurant were all company men so when the new guy came in, they went elsewhere in the chain. Within a week, we are hemorrhaging workers. The ship's going down, and everyone knows it. 

The new chef lasts ten shifts before he can't take the insanity. He starts hiding out and swilling brandy. Within a month, he is gone. He had moved across country to feature his own menu in this place and the owner was so bad he would rather be unemployed in a strange city then deal with him.

Around this point, I'm pretty much there all the time. The owner complains that I should be using my downtime to hire new employees and do training. Since this is no where near my job description there is much back and forth.

I knew he was going to be trouble. When I met him I stuck out my hand and said, ""Hi, I'm toxlab."" 

He stares at my hand. ""Khan.""

Okay, Mr. Khan? Is that your last name?""

""Khan.""

Allrighty then. I ask one of the front of the house survivors if he caught the bosses' full name. Kahn. His name is Kahn Kahn?  No one knows.

Now the place is imploding. With no new menu, the corporate menu from the hotel is being served. Except the supplies are no longer coming in. No wholesaler will give this guy credit. He's bringing in product in dribs and drabs, and he gets the absolute lowest priced everything. We take a filet off the menu because the meat he purchased was so bad it looked like dogfood. He insisted that every ounce of scrap anything be utilized, regardless of appearance and state of decay.

The rooms in the hotel have a room service menu that's even older and contains things like pizza that require special prep and can't be just thrown together. The free breakfast given to every guest is a huge lynchpin in his contract with the hotel, and he's going out of state to get egg product that cooks from frozen to a spongy egg loaf because it saves him ten bucks a day over fresh eggs. 

So now the place has become a cesspool of shit food and confusion. A steady stream of new hires comes in, and we consider it a success when someone makes it through a full shift. I'm the only one in the kitchen most days, and have taken to living at the hotel so I can work 5am to 2am. 

Oh, but the fun has only just begun. There were a lot of reservations booked. People who had contracts with the hotel were now being served by Kahn Kahn. Promises were made. Menus finalized. There were three of us available to set up a wedding reception. I left the kitchen and rolled round tables down the incline so we could set them up. I'm cooking all the food as well.

Hey, they chose to have key lime cheesecake. Sounds delish. Too bad all Kahn Kahn will buy is tiny plain servings. No matter, I make a key lime glaze to go on top.

Oh, the wedding party suddenly grew fifty percent and the pasta bar was flat after ten minutes. No problem, says Kahn Kahn. Just make more. Except we have no more pasta. We have no more sauce. We don't even have garlic for bread. 

He goes to the cash and carry and buys the bare minimum. To make sauce, I have to extend it with ketchup. One of my finest culinary moments, watching that get eaten and nobody saying boo.

After the catering came Easter brunch. The hotel was known for it, and we had four hundred on the books.

But we're still bleeding staff and all the ordering is fried. Vendors that give you equipment when you buy their product have begun picking stuff up. Kanh Kahn bitches and moans and makes promises, but everyone has had it with his not paying bills, so bye-bye toaster. bye-bye juice machine. bye-bye waffle maker. 

The day arrives, and it's a three man line to make a buffet for four hundred. A leader has emerged in the front of the house, but he's delusional. He sells Kahn Kahn on the idea of avoiding waste by restocking the bar to order. A pan empties out, call it back to the kitchen, they make a new one, it goes back out. I explain that this is a logistical nightmare, but Kahn Kahn and his new buddy think this will save him a couple bucks. 

A tray runs out. We start a new one. Meanwhile, people who wanted item X are eating item Y. When Y runs out, people start seeing the gaps. They want X and Y. Now the hoarding starts. Whole tray of bacon, gone. So long, sausage. It's clear that the buffet is being emptied and replaced piecemeal. The bitching begins. Not only is there no food, the service from years past is gone. The quality of the stuff available is clearly inferior. 

Kahn Kahn goes from table to table. I think he meant to reassure people, but the guy has no interpersonal skills and is insulting people left and right. 

He comes to yell at me and I chase him out with the fact that we are now out of bacon, sausage, and ham, and there are several hours left in service. I implore him to go to the cash and carry. 

Thirty minutes later, he returns with a shopping bag from the grocery store. Inside it:

* One pound bacon, store brand

* One package Brown and Serve sausages

* One package English ""Bangers"" sausages 


I held up the bacon. ""This is good. Now I just need about a hundred more of these."" He is incensed. He goes out front to escape the madness of the kitchen, only to find mass walkouts and unpaid bills. Everyone in the place is ready to shout at him. He moves to the hotel lobby and has people trying to fight him. He eventually gets in his car and takes off.

When the whole shameful thing was over, the dining room was trashed. The kitchen was worse. When all the garbage started overflowing and there was no one to remove it, paper and cardboard started piling up on the floor. At the end, we were nearly wading in it. 


I lasted about another two months before I got torn into for throwing away rotten shrimp. Kahn Kahn suggested I was throwing it away because I was going to eat it later. Wanna know why? Because ""White people steal.""


Yeah, that'll be enough of that.",Watch a Dream Turn Into a Nightmare,531,talesFromRetail

As of recent we are being remodeled to the small sum of 3.4 Million USD. As such we have large areas of our store fenced off with large construction gates. Behind one such gate we had a [bulldozer.](http://www.constructionequipment.com/wacker-neuson-803-mini-excavator) A baby but still strong enough to rip through concrete. This ladies is where our story begins!

As i was walking through the isles I notice one of the large gates has been moved. As i go to fix it I notice a small boy jumping up and down on our baby bulldozer! I rush over and tell him to get down, and all of a sudden I hear ""Stay away from my child!""

(i should have known a kid couldn't have moved those barriers) So out comes a belligerent mother (From now on BM) from behind a pallet of floor tiles.

BM: What are you doing with my child! Who are you?!?!

Me: I am an employee here and you two cant be here. (guess my name tag and bright red company logo on my shirt didnt give it away)

BM: Hes just playing around hes fine.

Me: Neither of you are allowed back here. You have to leave.

BM: He can play on it if he wants too. Its just a toy. I want to see your manager right now!

Me: No that is not a toy, and he cant play on it. Ill get a manager right now.

Since im currently the highest ranking member of my department i borrow the manager from the registers. A good friend of mine that takes no shit. So manager ""Fred"" walks back and immediately says ""Maam you and your son are not allowed to be back here you have to leave."" BM then starts off on him practically screaming.

BM: I come here all the time and have been a loyal customer for 20 years! Neither of you two can tell me what to do!

Fred: Maam either leave this area now or i am calling the police and will have your arrested for trespassing. 

BM: You cant do that im a customer!

Fred: This area is not part of the store right now so you are trespassing. Please leave now or i will call the police.

With the threat of the Fuzz she knew shed been beat and grabbed her kid that had been cowering behind her for awhile. She then proceeded to storm out of the store ranting about how wed wronged here and she was going to complain to corporate. But hey maybe me and Fred are bad guys trying to stop her kid from playing on a bulldozer.....Thank god the construction crew took the keys.

Boognish80,39,,68,1e568i,,437,"I work at a chain restaurant that serves fresh baked goods and specialty beverages as well as a broad range of sandwiches, salads, soups and pastas. Our menu changes several times a year, and our most recent seasonal menu started this past Tuesday.
 
Yesterday our district manager and her boss, the regional manager, came to visit our store. I do prep in the back of house. I portion our ingredients and prepare all of our fresh vegetables and fruit, and pull and thaw frozen entrees to be prepared hot by line. I do a lot of inventory control and assist my managers with counts and truck. A little while after the DM and RM arrived my DM came to me with an e-mail detailing some new information about times for shrimp, which is our newest menu item. I thanked her for the information and told her ""Boy, do I have some questions for you!"" She laughed and asked me what I needed. I had four or five different questions about procedures for preparing the shrimp, and myself, the DM, RM and my store manager had an active discussion about various shrimp-related topics. Both the DM and RM called several people to ask them for answers. After a little while, my RM said to me, ""Hey, these are great questions. Thank you."" I thanked her for talking with me and then, 
naturally, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the lunch rush from hell arose. 

There were customers filling our lobby, out into the foyer, having to place to-go orders because all of our tables were full. We did the most profitable hour we have ever done. I have been at my job for two years now, doing prep for a year and a half, and it was the first time in an extremely long time that I really felt like I was having to hustle. I felt like I did a pretty good job making sure the line was stocked up, and wasn't overly concerned about the corporate managers being in the store as I am always on top of my product quality.

After about three hours, things started to die down. The DM and RM (who had been helping out the entire time on the line and bakery) came back and continued their inspection of the store. After an hour or so, my store manager called me into the office and shut the door behind me. He told me that our RM was so impressed with me and the questions I had asked that she wanted to give me a raise! I was floored. I thanked him and went back to work. 

A little while later after they left my store manager and I went outside to take a well earned break. He told me that the RM asked him how much of a raise she should give me, and he had asked them for, and gotten, a seventy-five cent raise for me. This is absolutely huge. The day before yesterday I was approved for an apartment. I have never had a place strictly of my own before, I've only ever lived with my sister or people I was in a relationship with. I was feeling pretty worried about my potential to afford this place by myself, and so hearing this news out of the blue has alleviated much of my concern. I am also just really proud of the fact that someone at my workplace recognized the hard work I do, especially someone from the corporate end who is known for having high standards. I really do take a lot of pride in my job even though it is not something I see myself doing forever. 

Just wanted to tell you guys a happy story. This is one of my favorite subs and it seems like so many of us deserve better. 

TL:DR: Corporate managers come to visit my store on a record breaking day, I ask them a few questions about shrimp and get a surprise raise!

I do the first transaction which was the exchange, easy peasy. I get to the second one, and learn I want swallow the barrel of a gun. 

Me: Okay sir, since you are only returning one pair of jeans, and you got them on sale for BOGO $10, I'm going to have to adjust the price of these to remove the discount from the original purchase since you're not actually getting 2 now. 

Stoner Dude (SD): Saywhanow? 

Me: Uhm, well... They were buy one and get the second for $10. You are returning the pants that you paid full price on. And I can't just give you pair number two for $10 for no reason. So I'm going to have to refund that discount as well. 

SD: Oh. Okay. 

I do the return, price adjustments, double check with my manager to be sure I've got it all the right way and ask for his card to refund him. 

Me: There's going to be $12.48 refunded to your card.

Me: Yes, and I just explained how you were getting that discount refunded as well. So it's a difference of $12.48. 

SD: NAH MAN. Iwantforty.

Me: No. Corporate is the people who own the company, they are based out in California, and they are closed today. But I can let you speak to my manager if you like. 

SD: No. * *hands me his card to refund the money* *  Will she get me all my money back? 

Me: Unlikely but you can try. Her name is M!

M: If you're going to make a huge problem out of it I can either give you corporate's number or give you a full refund on the jeans. Which do you want? 

SD: Neither.

Crazy_Overlord,71,,107,1ntobm,,436,"I work in a pretty popular store. We sell everything from pharmaceuticals to high-end cosmetics. We also carry a lot of grocery items. You would think that, by now, people would understand that, as part of a franchise, our prices are set but, alas, some people still think that they can *haggle* with us for cheaper prices. Here are some stories.    
    
  
---
  
One of the most popular items we carry are eggs. These eggs are under one of our many store brands, meaning that it's a lot cheaper when compared to other brands. Usually, when on sale, a dozen can go for a low as $1.88. This particular week, the eggs happened to be that price. As always, someone was unsatisfied.  
  
As I was returned some items the shelves in our grocery aisle, a man (H for Haggler) and his family approached me.   
    
**H**: (holds out a carton of eggs to me) Some of these eggs are broken.  
  
**Me**: I'm so sorry! (I look over at the shelf and see that it's fully stocked with cartons of eggs. Maybe he was just informing me?) Did you want to grab another one?   
  
**H**: It's broken - can I get a discount?  
  
**Me**: Unfortunately we can't sell broken eggs - it's health code violation.  
  
**H**: (He looks a little bit miffed) But what are you going to with these eggs? I'll buy them!  
  
**Me**: Again, I can't sell them to you - it's *not safe*.  
  
**H**: I'll buy **ALL** your broken cartons!  
  
**Me**: Sir...I **can't!**  
  
**H**: (definitely upset at this point) Is there anyone else I could talk to?  
  
**Me**: (sigh...) Let me get my manager...  
  
My manager comes in and reiterates exactly what I said. H, again, brings up the fact that we're losing money by scrapping these eggs, but my manager informs him that we get reimbursed for the cartons containing broken eggs. H seems to finally understand and my manager and I walk away.  
  
Literally less than two minutes later, I go back into our grocery aisle to finish off my returns. There is H, this time asking a *different* person whether or not he could get a discount on cartons with broken eggs. I stuck around to hear my co-worker also turn down his offer.  
  
Needless to say, he ended up having to pay the measly $1.88 per carton price.  
  
---  
  
Our store also carries laptops and netbooks. We don't have a very varied supply and most of our prices tend to be a little above that of our competitors (we make up for it with our membership card - our point system is one of the best). One of the netbooks we sell is pretty tiny and, in all honesty, not much to look at. It retails for about $200 but, since no one was buying it, my manager lowered it to $50.   
  
That day, we were having a special promotion. We were bumping up the reward levels of our points system, which meant customers were able to save even more than before. Unfortunately, this was also the day that Points Man (PM) decided to show up during my shift.  
  
PM *always* asks to check his points balance as soon as he gets in the store. Usually this is no problem, but the thing with PM is that he *always* insists that he's supposed to have more points than what shows up on screen. **Every.single.time,** he says, ""Ehhh...I'm supposed to have (insert high number of points here)!""  and, **every.single.time,** I have to give him the website to check his points balance and to see where his points went.  
  
I realize that our system screws up once in a while, but I've cashed out PM before and I *always* see him cashing out his points at the lowest level, instead of waiting until they're worth more. After these transactions, I always make it a point to explain to PM that, since he used his points, he's now back to a lower number. I guess he has selective memory when it comes to these things...  
  
Anyways...so here comes PM and I instantly cringe. Again, we do the whole points balance dance and he insists that he's supposed to have more points. For the next hour, he strolls around the store and picks up some stuff (I remember baby formula - he tends to buy a lot of it) and maybe some diapers? One of the other things he picks up is the $50 laptop.  
  
He pushes his cart up to my till and I ring him up. When it comes to the laptop, PM is really excited and goes on about how it's such a good deal and he's been wanting to buy something like this for a while. After I explain to him that it's a clear out item, PM winks at me, smiling, and asks if it's possible for me to give him a better deal. ""Uhhh...**no.**"" Like most people who try to pull this stunt, once I turn him down he asks for the manager.
  
**Manager:** What's the price of the laptop now?  
**Me:** $50  
**Manager:** What's the original price?  
**Me:** $200...  
**Manager:** ...That's the best we can do.   
  
PM decided not to get the laptop, only to ask for it a couple of weeks later. I guess he was just waiting for it to go on further sale. Unfortunately for him, someone had already snatched it up.   
  
---  
   
The same thing that happened with PM happened with another couple. They wanted to buy a camera on clear out and tried to bargain for a cheaper price. The camera was, originally, $229 and was on clear out for $50.  My supervisor straight-out told them no and explained that we were actually losing money by selling it at that price, already. Apparently, that still wasn't good enough and the couple then asked for a manager to weigh in. Again, they were told no. They didn't buy the camera.

stopstaringatmeswan4,28,,102,1fgwlu,,432,"I work as a secretary in a real estate office. 

A client (R.B) calls me up and asks why his house's listing hasn't been cancelled yet. He faxed us the signed cancellation form yesterday, so why is his house still listed?

I tell R.B. that I was here at the office all day yesterday, and I didn't receive any cancellation forms. He starts flipping out, calling me a stupid liar, etc. I tell him to send me the cancellation form again, and I would take care of it right away.

I technically can't take care of it right away, as after I track down the manager and get him to sign the form, I still have to send it to the head office to finalize the cancellation, and head office doesn't operate on weekends. But I tell him I will just to get him to STFU.

I was promptly informed that it was already sent, no way in hell would he send it again, I better find it and take care of it IMMEDIATELY. I told him again to send it to me, and got hung up on.

I called the agent selling the house, who did not receive a copy of the signed form either.

20 minutes later, him, his wife and their (seriously) smelly little 5 year old come barging into my office. His bitch wife sets the kid up on top of the [counter](http://i.imgur.com/EE7z5Ik.jpg) in front of my desk. Within 30 seconds the kid was fooling around, leaned over backwards and dunked her hair in my coffee. The brain-dead parents laughed at her, and continued yelling at me.

After I told him for the 20th time that I don't have his goddamned form, he 'magically' finds the link to the form and emails it to me. I print it out, and have him sign it. R.B and his family leave. 5 minutes later, I've already washed my hands of the whole ordeal, and suddenly I see my manager's (W.T.) number pop up on the call display.

W.T. is the type of manager who almost always sides with the clients. In his eyes, none of the administrative staff can do anything right, so now I know R.B complained, and I'm in deep shit now.

I was wrong about being in deep shit, W.T started the conversation by saying, ""So, I just talked to the assholes from (address), are you ok?"" I just about had an aneurism. This is the first decent thing I've ever heard out of W.T's mouth... I wish I could have heard the call R.B made, to see how rude he was to W.T

**TL;DR:** Asshole expects me to conjure paperwork out of thin air, his kid dunks her hair in my coffee, and for once my manager is cool.

detourxp,22,,72,1p5x5q,,431,"I work at a general entertainment park, a place with go-karts, mini golf, an arcade and other misc. rides and attractions. To start, i would like to point out that at the time of this story, i was 18 and the youngest manager at this park. 

We do not get very busy during the week, meaning we have a very small daily labor budget. The MOD usually ends up very stressed trying to complete all of the daily chores with only a few employees and keeping the guests happy at the same time. The managers almost always (if they're at least halfway decent) help out by taking out trash and cleaning tables or cooking kitchen orders at the snack bar. 

On this particular day, i was helping the employee stationed at the snack bar clean the cafe as quickly as possible. I'm wearing sanitary gloves and taking out the 5 trash cans that the staff on the previous day left full (boy do i have stories of lazy employees). A guest comes by looking slightly angry, so i set down the bin and ask if there's anything i could help her with. She scoffs and says ""No, i don't think you could."" 

I understand how my appearance could give her the impression that i'm just a trash bitch, so i kindly tell her that i'm actually the manager.

""Sure you are sweetie"" she said as she walks past me without looking me in the eye. She walks up to the other employee, who is ~30 years old, and starts to make various complaints about our park and how we shouldn't be charging as much as we are and blah blah blah. Finally at the end of her rant she adds ""And that bus boy was very rude to me and i would like to talk to your manager.""

""Uh... What bus boy?""

*sigh* ""THAT guy"" as she poins her finger towards me

the woman working with me starts to smile and says ""I'll grab my manager right away ma'am.""

The guest looks at me with smirk as the employee walks from behind the counter and walks towards me and says ""There's a customer complaint sir.""

I walk forward and say ""Hi how can i help you i'm the manager."" The look on her face was pure embarrassment and shame. After that it was pretty anticlimactic.

I must have looked blank, because he clarified:

IAMgrampas_diaperAMA,82,,119,1pfpi5,,428,"I work as a pharmaceutical technician at a popular drugstore chain and our store is VERY high volume. We are situated in suburbia and are the primary pharmacy for 3 old folks' homes in the area so the level of entitlement amongst our customers is enormous. 

I have experience as a cashier and a technician so on this particular Saturday (our busiest day of the week) I was working an 8 hour shift at the register. Saturdays we have two registers open but seeing as I'm the only cashier, I put a sign that says ""closed"" at Counter 2 so that people will line up at Counter 1 and I'm not running back and forth and having to deal with ""who was first"" situations (a fucking nightmare, you would think these people are children).

Right, so I'm serving a client at Register 1 and an elderly woman strolls up to Register 2, completely disregarding the ""closed"" sign. At this point in my shift, I only have one client at Register 1. We are waiting for my manager to come over and do a refund for her.

While waiting for my manager to come, I go over to Register 2 and put the sign to the side and ask ""how can I help you?""

Old Lady: I called in a prescription

**manager arrives**

**Me to my manager**: I just need you to do a refund for this customer over here please.

**Old Lady**: Excuse me, are you serving her or me?

She was actually visibly ANGRY that I had spoken to my manager instead of seamlessly continuing the transaction with her, the client. I was so shocked by this that I literally stared at her for a solid 10 seconds.

**OL**: I SAID, are you serving her or me?

**Me**: How can I help you?

**OL**: Oh my god. I told you I called in a prescription

**Me**: Okay, what is your name?

**OL**: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I JUST TOLD YOU!

At this point, I have people lining up behind both customers at both counters (the situation I wanted to AVOID IN THE FIRST PLACE). So I'm getting really fucking agitated which is not like me, but I was 5 hours into my shift and tired and hungry. So I snapped.

**Me**: No, you DIDN'T actually.

At this point, her husband and two other customers behind this old lady go **OOOOOOHHHH!!!**, like I'd made some huge dis towards this woman. I swear to god.

Her husband walks up to the counter and goes

**Husband**: ""You really need to change your attitude. Why don't you put a smile on your face for a start?""

Now keep in mind that my manager has been standing here the whole time, seeing this woman being a complete bitch to me. So manager takes over old lady's transaction while I go back to Register 1, shaking. Not before looking at the husband straight in the eyes and saying dramatically 

""**Never** for you.""

I am not a comedically timely person or witty by any means but my manager almost died laughing right there. Both of them went off on a rant about how they were going to change pharmacies and how I needed to get an attitude adjustment and how dare I. My manager assured them I would get reprimanded and they left grumbling to themselves.

I asked my manager if I was really going to get in trouble for what I said and she said

A bit back I posted a story about a woman who tried to shoplift that I caught. [This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j4xzk/apparently_paying_is_optional/)

Well she came back. 

Except the owner caught her loading unpaid items into her car, confronted her, almost got run over by her (third time that's happened to him with a shoplifter, we're taking out life insurance on him) but got her license plate number. The cops were called, reports were filed, mugshots were identified, and charges were pressed. 

Everything should be fine and dandy, right? 

Wrong.

Right before closing a man wandered in looking for the owner. I informed him the owner already left. He asked me if I knew the owner (note: we are a small garden center store). I said of course I do, he's my boss. 

Well. What transpired next was so mind-bendingly backwards that I seriously considered becoming a cloistered nun with no contact with humanity. The man identified himself as the husband of the shoplifter and informed me that she was currently in a custody battle with her ex-husband for their two kids. Already the world's smallest violin was playing a sob song. He told me it would be mighty Christian of us not to press charges so she could win the custody case. 

I think I might have had my mouth open. This was the same guy who called after I had caught her shoplifting the first time and accused us of harassing her. She's now been caught stealing at the store twice.  

After a minute of trying to make civil words, I politely told him he would need to speak to the owner. 

He turned red. And started yelling that he was going to tell everyone he knew how we were a terrible store that was causing a woman to lose her children. How dare we ruin their lives!

I told him that the shoplifting was causing her to lose her children. 

I know I shouldn't have said that but for the love of God, are you seriously standing there, yelling at me that your wife shoplifted and now has to pay the consequences?  


He began resembling a tomato at this point as he continuously screeched at me throwing out words like ""defamation"" ""shame on you"" ""Maury"". 

I smiled vacantly at him pointed to the front gate and said ""Sorry sir, we're closed now. The owner will be here for you to talk to tomorrow.""

Then I went home and had a massive bottle of wine.

rumplesplitskin,22,,103,1kutqq,,428,"Since i can't sleep due to the heat i thought i would post a second tale from the petrol station where i try not to work.

A good few years ago when i was only a lowly cashier working on the back shift two wonderfully flamboyant gay men came into the
shop dressed like they were going to a carnival. Feather scarfs, neon coloured Lycra body suits and pimp style hats. They looked fantastic the only thing that gave me the heebies was the tightness of their shorts, so tight you could tell their religion if you get what i mean.

Now due to being out clubbing the weekend before i had seen posters advertising a LG&amp;B festival taking place soon so i guessed these guys were on their way to it. Once they had picked up their supplies and came up to the counter i asked the usual stuff like have you got any fuel and would you like anything else then started to scan their items. Like i do with most customers i try to make a little small talk..

ME : Hello guys, going to the festival ?

GG1 : No, what makes you think that ? (he starts to laugh)

ME : Mmm.. i'm not sure, it just came to mind(i also am laughing now)

GG1 : How do you know about it and are you coming later ?

ME : Naw, it's not my kind if thing but you might see my mate there. He's going dressed in a gorilla suit.

GG2 : Oh please tell us his name so if we see him we can mess with his head by pretending we know him under his suit.

ME : ""Gives first name only"" Now if you do see him say this ""i've got a lovely bunch of coconuts"" it's a private joke and he will freak out.

By this time i'm finished scanning their items and ask if their is anything else. GG2 looks at GG1 and nods over to the corner where we keep
our condoms. He reaches over and picks up a pack of durex but not just you common condom one of the ones that has that little vibrating thing on the top. Yipp, he's picked up a cock ring.

They both stare at the package in his hand and then out of the blue GG1 says ""i'm not sure this will fit"" only for GG2 to reply without any hesitation ""oh honey, i'm not sure they come in extra small"" and runs out the shop laughing.

By now i'm nearly crying with laughter and try as i might i just can't control myself. GG1 pays for the cock ring and as he leaves he says to me ""if he thinks he's getting some tonight, he's soooooooo wrong""

I just about manage say ""have a great time tonight"" through my laughter. I never seen those guys again but if on the off chance that you two guys read this i want to thank you for giving me the best laugh i've ever had working with the public.

KikiAppleKick,72,,114,1jw54i,,424,"Alright, so here is the second installment of my adventures of working in a pound/dollar store as part of the management team. It's a little longer than the last one but hopefully it's not too bad. It also isn't so much funny as just plain annoying.

This happened around Easter time and I was working stock in the stationary department when a woman aged perhaps 40-50 years old walks up to me with some craft stationary items. Let us call her CL (Craft Lady).

(CL is carrying a few packets of polystyrene ""decorate your own"" easter eggs and is looking at the pens, pencils and paints in the stationary section which I am currently filling.)
**CL**: Excuse me but do you know which would work best on these eggs? Would it be pen, pencils, paints or something else? I'm decorating them for my garden, you see.

**Me**: Oh, sorry ma'am but I'm not entirely sure! I think perhaps a paint that is resistant to water once dry might be best but I'm not really sure if that's correct. I'm sorry I can't be of more help to you.

**CL**: What do you mean you don't know which works best?! 
(Her voice gets ever so slightly louder and high pitched.)

**Me**: Well I'm not a craft expert and I wouldn't want to give you advice that I wasn't 100% sure of as I don't wish to ruin your display that you plan to make. It would be inconsiderate of me to give you some information that I have no guarantee is completely correct. 
(I start to blush a little as she steps closer and stares at me very intently before looking me up and down.)

**CL**: And *you* work **here**?
(She stands and raises her eyebrow at me, waiting expectantly for an answer.)

**Me**: Well yes, ma'am, I do work here... Why do you ask?
(I had to keep myself calm at this time because of the snort of absolute derision she made at my answer.)

**CL**: How can you even work here if you don't know what you're talking about? How **dare** you sell craft items if you *aren't* an expert. Where is your manager? I want to speak with them **right now**.
(She raises her voice at the last sentence and makes a point to continually look me up and down before rolling her eyes at me.)

**Me**: Ma'am, I am one of the store managers and I would appreciate it if you do not act so judgemental towards me when I am simply doing my job to the best of my abilities.

**CL**: **YOU** are a *MANAGER*?! No *wonder* this shop has no helpful staff if their **boss** is so f~king useless! 
(She then turns to the other customer in the aisle and begins to point at me and snort some more.)

**CL** ^(to the customer) : Can you *believe* this girl?! She's *lying* about being a manager! THE NERVE!

(Now this customer is a regular in my store and he is one of the quietest men I have ever met but she must have pushed his buttons because he spoke up for me. Let us call him Knight.)

**Knight**: Excuse me love, but this young lass actually *is* one of the managers and you're being a total c~t right now to her. I think she deserves a damn apology from you right now!
(He stood with his arms crossed and glared at CL who began to stutter and go red in the face.)

**CL**: HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT! I'M GOING TO GET THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS STORE TO KICK YOU OUT FOR YOUR RUDE BEHAVIOUR!

**Me**: Well I am sorry to disappoint you ma'am but I **AM** the management and I feel that you are the one being rude right now. I am sincerely sorry that I am unable to be an expert on the 5000 plus items that we sell in store, items which change every single week might I add, but I am trying my hardest and you are out of line in your behaviour towards myself and your fellow customer. I am going to have to ask you to either apologise or remove yourself from my store.

**CL**: **YOUR** store?! You aren't even the manager! 

At this point I actually had to call the mall security to have her removed. She got a little mouthy and I was glad to have the security there as witness to her verbal abuse because she tried to bring the local papers into it, thankfully that never came to anything.

As for Knight, I gave him £5 worth of store credit (it was all I was authorised to give him without getting permission from my Head Office) and he still comes in every so often to talk to me.

TL'DR: Stuck up woman treats me like dirt because I am not an arts and crafts expert while working in a pound/dollar store. Other customer sticks up for me and woman is escorted from the premises by security. Tries to take the story to the papers, gets laughed at by them. The end.

Cubbenstein,41,,64,1jjv9m,,426,"Having read so many horror stories here, I wanted to share something which I hope someone enjoys.

About 10 years ago, I found myself working in a department store after dropping out of high school in Australia. It seemed a good buffer before figuring out how I was going to get into uni.

While working there, I quickly learnt that were nasty customers, but there were also nice customers. I always enjoyed striking up conversation with the nice customers, which helped the day pass faster. One such nice customer was a woman, in her mid-40s, who always came in with a smile; but she never spoke back to me. 

She was deaf.

Nevertheless, I always made an effort to attempt conversation, which meant I usually carried a small notepad and pen in my pocket, so we could write notes and pass them back and forth. I decided that if I had a chance to learn sign language, I would take it.

Eventually, I left retail to finish my schooling, and where I went (TAFE) offered a variety of subjects to study - including sign language. I really enjoyed the class, and it was a rewarding 12 months of study.

Fast forward 10 years, to when I have a graduate degree, and someone deaf walks through my office. I excitedly introduce myself in sign. It's enough to make a connection, and exchange contact details so that I could continue to practice my signing.

That office later closed down, and shortly after, I found myself working as a project manager... in a deaf community services organisation. The person I introduced myself to turned out to be a director in the organisation, and when a new job was created, my name came up as someone to recruit.

Retail can be hard, unrewarding work, but it spurred me on to learn another language. Deaf communities in each city are small, so it shouldn't be too long before I run into the woman from the store again, and have a conversation without the use of my pad and pen.",Retail made me learn a new language,490,talesFromRetail
Godolin,123,,126,1fs659,,431,"I don't get why people still think it's completely acceptable to pay for stuff with checks. Very large purchases, maybe. But not everyday stuff. Anyway, this took place about four months ago or so.

It had been a rather slow day at work, and we had planned for that by scheduling lightly. Behind the counter was one of our newer workers, who was still being trained/getting used to using the registers. Maybe fifteen feet away, I was restocking and sorting our greeting cards.

About halfway through the shift, an older woman came up to the register and started a transaction with him. As payment time came around, I was just walking past when my coworker didn't notice she'd started to fill out a check. Interjecting, I said to the woman (Check Lady, henceforth) ""I'm sorry miss, we don't take checks.""

And in an instant, it's like I'd called her a cheap whore. On the offense, she replies ""Well I've already started to fill this one out. What do you expect me to *do* with this now?""

Me: ""Void it out, if you've got to. I'm sorry, but our main office forbids any location from taking checks as payment.""

Check Lady: ""That's absolutely ridiculous. I paid with a check last time I was here, I'm going to pay with a check this time too.""

Me: ""Again, I can't let that happen. If we let that you pay with that, both of us can be fired.""

Check Lady: ""Ugh, fine. I'll put it on my credit card. But I'm billing *store name* for the interest fees. You really ought to put up some signs if you're going to change your policy.""

At this point, I'm free to leave him to the card transaction. Several seconds later, however, that changes. Her card is one of the few types of cards that have several extra steps to put through our system, and coworker has never dealt with one before. Not blaming him at all, he'd only been there a month or so at that point. And 95% of that had been out on the floor, helping with the holiday rush.

As I come back over and take over, the woman continues on her entitlement spree. In the 30 second it took to finish the sale, she had the gall to inform me that ""This is absolutely ridiculous"" and that she'd ""lost a lot of faith in *Store Name*'s customer service today."" Luckily, she promised she would never be shopping with us again.

We're a pretty niche store. As far as I'm aware, there are only six stores in the state that sell the merchandise we do counting ourselves. Three of those are our other locations. I still smirk when I see her walk in.

melodyponddd,91,,133,187toj,,427,"Holy, shit you guys. Ho. Lee. Shit. 

I wish I had a TARDIS so that I could go back in time and video record this entire thing. 

I was at the red and khaki Bullseye store (used to work there, shop there all the time) and was waiting for my mom to get out of line. All of a sudden, I hear a bit of an altercation going on between a guest and a cashier. 

I don't know what exactly caused this argument to go down, but I am going to make a guess that since this woman was ranting about her children being ""angels"", her kid did something and the cashier told them not to do that. I am going to guess, since they were making references to the conveyer belt, the kids were putting their hands on it and the cashier told them not to, out of concern that they could get hurt. 

So this woman just starts SCREAMING at the cashier, and kept referring to her children as her ""Little angels"". They were going back and forth until she asked for a manager. So the cashier got the GSTL (Guest Service Team Lead) who is pretty much manager for the cashiers. 


Woman: I COME HERE ALL THE TIME AND SPEND LOTS OF MONEY HERE. I COME HERE WEEKLY, BUT IF HE CONTINUES TO WORK HERE, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE ANYMORE. 

She makes several references to her children being upset. By this point pretty much EVERYONE in the front lanes - guests and other cashiers are turning their heads and watching this until a woman comes up to her and says, ""Ma'am, excuse me, but you are upsetting MY children. There is no need to make a scene."" 

The woman: ""YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T MY PROBLEM. STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS."" 

So the GSTL calls one of the LODs (Leader on Duty). Meanwhile, the cashier is trying to keep doing his job. 

The woman: I don't want you to help me. In fact, stop talking to me. Just be quiet. 

I know this cashier. I had worked with him for a while before I quit. He is a very nice guy; great cashier. And he's also kind of quiet. He doesn't speak a lot, so I know he must have said something to her children that wasn't inappropriate, he's just dealing with a helicopter mom. Her telling him to ""be quiet""...I have never seen him so angry before.

Cashier: You do NOT get to tell me to be quiet. First of all, I am NOT your child. I am not EVEN a child. I'm a GROWN MAN and you have NO right to talk to me that way (he's in his 40s, mind, so not a teenager) 

This woman becomes outraged that someone would DARE talk back to her. The LOD tells him to get off the registers. Other guests are coming up to this woman and asking her to lower her voice. She wouldn't. The LOD and GSTL finally get her to calm down. 

Then my mom was done checking out and I didn't see what happened after that. 

The best part out of all of this was that I'm wearing jeans, a black coat, had my purse, shopping bags and was texting my boyfriend telling him about  this scene, and a shopper comes up to me and asks if my lane (register) is open. I just laughed at her.

A kid picked out his games and over spent on his gift card amount so the male adult with him said put something back.
The kid went nuclear, damn near throwing shit until the adult quietly said you know what I'll cover X game so you can get them all.     

I rung him up and didn't mention the remaining balance on his gift card. The kid snatched the receipt and realized he had about ten dollars left.     
The adult male gave me a smug smile and the kid proceeded to go pick out more games again breaking his gift card limit.
The kid started sobbing and slobbering about how he needed these games to live.     
The adult male said in a super happy tone ""I have a fix for this, let me see the other games.""     
He handed me the just purchased games and said, ""You have a 7 day return policy right? Oh and do you want him to put the cases back on the wall for wasting your time?""     
I said, ""No I can handle it, thanks though.""     
As I was processing his return he grabbed the kid, started to walk out, and said to me, ""You can donate the gift card to a deserving kid I bought it therefore I have the right to do with it as I please.""

kaylie-draws,107,,105,1hmkiz,,432,"This happened a few months ago when I was working as a cashier. 

A customer lined up with his items, and after I scanned everything the total came up to (from what I remember) $87. 
For some reason he asked me for just enough cash back so his total would become $100. At this store, we only gave cash back in intervals of $20. I told him that,  and responded in a very raised voice:
""Forget it. You just can't figure it out because WOMEN CAN'T DO MATH!"" and immediately jammed his debit card into the pin pad. 
I was very shocked. I worked in a very nice neighborhood so this sort of stuff was unusual... I replied with ""excuse me?!"" but stupidly I still processed his order and let him go.

Doombuggie41,129,,97,1gfv49,,426,"Well, I work at small store in a large retail chain. The majority of our customers are affluent so you wouldn't expect extreme cheapness, that expectation is wrong.

I work in technology sales and service so I do get to see a lot of customers. I get lots of sales and lots of questions, but a few have always stood out to me.

My first story is from last summer. I had just returned from a three week vacation backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico and Colorado. About two hours into my shift I get a phone call.

* Me: Hello, Retail Store townname, myname speaking, how may I help?
* Customer: Hello, I bought an external hard drive from you last week and I was told that if I bought it you would transfer my files to it and put them on a new computer.
* Me: We do offer a data backup service where we do just that, it runs for $lightly Overpriced Fee dollars.
* Customer: I was told it would be done for free.
* Me: I am unaware of such a service, do you the name of the associate of whom you spoke to?
* Customer: Yes, myname, it was you.
* Me: Are you sure?
* Customer: Yes I remember reading it on your name tag.
* Me: I'm sorry, but that is impossible, I have been away for the last three weeks and could not have been able to help you. If you would like to have the data backed up and transferred you can pay for the service. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

The customer then hung up.

The next story is at the tech counter of my store. A customer who I had sold a PC to roughly 6 months ago enters and puts his laptop down on the PC.

* Me: Hello, what can I help you with today.
* Customer: I need you to fix my computer.
* Me: Ok let me take a look to see what is wrong.
--The PC would POST but would not go into windows.
* Me: Ok, it looks like there is an issue with Windows. I can charge you a diagnostic fee that can be credited towards any repairs or to a new PC if your current PC needs to be replaced. I can probably find out what the issue is by tomorrow.
Customer: I bought the PC here, I want it fixed now. I know you have easy click click tap tap methods.
--I was a little bit startled by his statement.
* Me: It could be an issue with either the hardware of software. I need to run some tests in order to find out what the exact problem is so that I can fix it.
* Customer: No I want it fixed NOW!!!
--The customer then performs verbal diarrhea on me explaining his life story and how the world has been woe to him. My somewhat-of-a-bonehead manager exits the office swinging his keys in hand. The customer points at me and is calling me incompetent in doing my job.
* Manager: Sir, I realize you're in a tough spot and are having trouble. I'll return the PC for store credit or give you a new one right now.
* Customer: No, I want it fixed now.
--My manager then explains that we can not help him, the customer then says how it will be in the paper that he could not get his PC fixed (lol?). While walking out the door the cashier bids farewell.
* Cashier: Have a good day sir!
* Customer: I'm never shopping at storename again!
* Cashier: Have a good day sir! 

I just loved how the girl working as cashier had no change in tone after he said that haha.

Today I got this call, a bit odd as usual.

* Me: Hello, Retail Store townname, myname speaking, how may I help?
--The customer had a thick long island accent, not that there's anything wrong with people from Long Island, I used to date a girl from there.
* Customer: Hi, I would like to purchase computer xyz.
* Me: Yes we have it on clearance for $320 dollars
* Customer: Ok, and what comes with it.
* Me: A trial version of Norton.
* Customer: That's it? I want Office.
* Me: Yes, we have office for $140.
* Customer: I the office for free, I'm not paying half the price of the computer on Office.
* Me: I'm sorry, but I am unable to do that.
* Customer: Why not?
--Yes I was just asked that....
* Me: I'm sorry, I am unable to modify the price on anything.
Customer: What do you offer in terms of setting the PC up.
* Me: We can do (I describe a bunch of services I'd do) for $100.
* Customer: I want you to do that for me for free like businessname does it.
--I know for a fact that the other business we compete with does not offer the service for free...
* Me: I'm sorry, I am unable to do that for you, you need to pay for the service in order for me to perform it.
* Customer: So let me get this straight, I go in and buy the computer and you do nothing to service me as the customer? I saw you helping a customer with a new PC just the other day!
* Me: No, we do offer a (I describe an offer we give with every PC) with your computer to help you get started. I have customers buy a setup package every day, I was likely just helping another one.
* Customer: I'll just go to businessname. Goodbye.

--She never did. Ironically later that day the customer came in and quietly bought the laptop anyway. My cashier told me a woman with a thick Long Island accent had just bought a certain PC, I was laughing inside.

randomfunnyword,79,,108,16abta,,425,"I was told you guys might appreciate this story:

The first job I had in high school was working at a gas station. The gas station was family owned and the gentleman that owned it treated me like family. He worked with me on scheduling while I attended community college and was a downright nice person. 

I worked my way up to the position of assistant manager by showing up for every shift, speaking English, and being overly responsible for 19. The other guy that worked my shift with me was Antonio, a flamboyantly gay Mexican. He spoke English well after you spent enough time around him to pick up on his dialect of Spanglish. 

One day I receive a page from Antonio to come to the cash register. Standing at the register are two fake tab blonde girls in their early 20's. I walk to the register and ask what's up. I'm informed by Antonio that the girls wanted a water. I offer them a courtesy cup and point toward the soda fountain. One of the girls explains with a semi valley girl twang (obviously from CA) that they don't drink tap water and that they've already explained to Antonio that they want a bottled water. I say alright, go head and purchase one and I'll ring you up. Valley girl is getting irritated, ""We shouldn't have to pay for water.""

""Well, the fountain has a filter and is essentially the same stuff as the bottled water, you can have some of that for free or you can purchase a bottle."" I responded, ""I'm sorry, but we have to pay for the bottled water and so do you.""

The girls are visually upset, they huff and sigh and I finally walk toward the back of the store. I go back into the cooler to go about my business assuming its handled. A couple of minutes later Antonio calls me back to the front. He shows me two water bottles in a trash can. The girls had emptied water bottles in a fountain cup and told him they got water from the fountain. This absolutely set me off. I look out at a gas pump and see them getting ready to pump their gas. I wait for the girl to start pumping her gas before I stop the pump after less than .25 G of gas. This occurs 2-3 more times before the girl comes in to complain about the gas pump. I explain that maybe it's broken and she should try another pump. She moves her car to another pump and we replay the same scenario. She comes back into the store even more upset and shorter on patience this time. I explain that there must be an issue with her card and that she should call her bank. She then asked why the pump said ""Stopped by Attendant"". 

Shit. I'm busted. What do I do? 

I ask to see the card and say that I'll try running it inside. I promptly ring up the two stolen waters as a credit transaction, hand her card back and tell her that she can buy gas somewhere else. 

TL:DR bitchy girls think they're too good for tap water so they steal bottled water from a gas station I was working at. I keep turning their gas pump off when they're trying to get gas. When they come in to see what's wrong I ask to see the card, ring them up for the water and tell them to leave.

boooobarella,108,,100,14y4qv,,431,"I'm in customer service for a national consumer electronics chain and recently had a customer whose child left my head shaking. She was in her 40s but easily looked 60 because of how run-down she was. This lady was actually shaking. Her 8 year old adopted son was next to her. She was trying to exchange two items that she had a replacement plan for. One was an mp3 player and the other was a  Nintendo 3DS. Both items were smashed to pieces (which was covered under the plan). I looked into her customer history and saw she had exchanged the Nintendo many times before. My coworker, who was standing next to me started wondering if it was maybe a scam. While her son was getting something out of a vending machine, I asked the lady what happened to the Nintendo.

She told me a story (while shaking) of how she adopted this boy when he was 2 years old and how his mother had lots of kids and they're all now separated. The mother was on drugs and then died when the child was 2, so this woman adopted him. Subsequently, this kid developed some pretty serious problems with authority and became very anti-social and destructive. He has smashed all of the Nintendos on purpose because he was mad about something. This woman said she loves the kid like he was her own and she's known him and has tried to adopt him since he was born, but that everyone in her life told her to give him away because he was ruining her life. I felt bad for her.

The kid came back and she and I kept talking about him. I told her that I've heard of a form of discipline where you take away literally everything that the child has so that he has nothing to destroy. That she takes anything he could possibly destroy out of the house and padlock her room and any other room she can so he can't get in. She should take away TV and any other privileges completely and even take his clothes away from him, only to be doled out by her daily. She was intrigued. The kid knew we were talking about him and said ""Why don't you just shut the fuck up?"" I look at him and say he can't talk to adults that way. He starts talking back to me. The mother doesn't intervene. I can tell she's just defeated and no matter what she says, he won't listen anyway. As I give the Nintendo to his mother, she asks me when I'll be working next so I tell her. They start walking away and the kid mutters, ""Fucking bitch."" My reply? ""Same to you, kid.

Andrew_j2288,75,,95,1kdnjr,,430,"I worked at a larger mid-western grocery store for about 6 years. For 2 years, I worked in the customer service area. I was about 20-21 at the time. If anyone works in retail now, avoid customer service areas at all costs. At our store, we did money wiring transactions, lotto, and some bills were able to be paid here. A majority of the time, we dealt with people who had forgotten coupons, or we explained the weekly ad a little more clearly for people who didn't understand at first. My story occurs with the latter, and a special kind of asshole.

I had this guy come up saying he wasn't given the special discount for a certain type of ketchup. The sale we had running was a list of items throughout the store that when you bought ten of them, you received so much off of your order. It was always easy to tell which items were on sale on the receipt, because they were marked with an asterisk. I **always** hated these sales. The messed up thing was, for specific items, they were specific sizes or ounces. This ~~dick~~ customer came up and said, ""I didn't get my five dollars off."" Common complaint. I check his receipt, and notice his two ketchups are not the correct brand. I let him know which brand is actually on sale and I would be more than happy to give him a rain check if we happen to be out of stock. He gives me the look. We all know that look. This is our conversation. 

C-""I don't use that fucking ketchup."" 

Me-(dumbfounded) ""I'm sorry sir, but that is the ketchup that is included in our sale.""

C-""I don't give a damn, I want **THIS** ketchup, and I want it **NOW!!**""

C-""Sir, this ketchup is regular price, if need be, I can always get a manager to see if there is anything they can specifically do."" 

By this time, I have a line of about 3 people. There is a stocky woman in her mid 30's, who I know by name. Lets call her Sally. Sally usually comes in to buy lotto tickets. Midday/Evening Pick 3. Always the nicest customer I had. Sally walked up midway through this conversation, and is giving said ~~jerk~~ customer the dirtiest look. 

C-""I don't need your manager, I want **YOU** to quit being so god damn lazy, and give me my $5 dollars back!""

Me-""Sir, this isn't something I can just do, I need management approval.""

C-""You know what, this is why people bring guns into places like this..""

My jaw hit. the. ground. I have never been threatened with a gun in my life. I froze, and didn't want to move. Everyone around the customer service/self checkout heard him say this, and I thought of one quick retort. 

Me- ""Unfortunately, I have to take that statement as a threat. Now, the police need to be involved.""

C, obviously nervous-""I'm leaving anyway, since you won't do shit for me.""

Dickhead bolts for the door, with Sally on his heels making a call to the police.

Sally-""DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!""

Sally was my savior that day. She followed the guy out to his car, and gave the police his licence plate number. She stayed until the police came in to talk to me. The store manager, who was usually a jerk, let me sit up stairs with Sally while we both talked to the police individually. After the cops talked to the customer himself, they ended up banning the guy from the store completely and I got to go home early. They never found any evidence that he had a gun on him, or if he even owned a gun. 


Even telling this story now gives me chills. I sincerely hope no one is ever threatened with a gun while working.

**EDIT**- formatting/spelling

**EDIT 2**- I didn't expect this many comments for my story, but a lot of people said how great Sally was. I did buy Sally about $20 worth of lotto scratch off's, and paid for her daily pick 3's for a week. I wish I could have done more, but she refused me buying her a gift card, or giving her cash for anything else. I have since lost touch, but she is a great person, and I hope she continues to be blessed to this day. ","""This is why people bring guns into places like this..""",525,talesFromRetail

**The story** I recently had a customer come in to look at a fake stone product we sell. He asked what stock we had at the time and I advised we don't have any but we are expecting a new shipment in 6 weeks time (it comes from overseas). Customer nods, thanks me for my time, grabs a card and walks out.

**Me:** Sorry sir, as I mentioned yesterday, we don't have any of that particular stone in stock for around 6 weeks. I can give you a call when it is in if you like, or we can go back to the showroom and you can have a look at the range we have in stock to pick again. 

**AW**: Are you telling me (voice starts to rise) that I drove for FIVE hour to pick it up and you don't even have it?!

**Me:** Sorry sir, I did mention when you asked yesterday that we don't have any in stock until (insert month I can't remember). 

**AW:** Don't treat me like a dickhead! I know you have it and just don't want to sell it to me. Get your fucking manager out here now, I am going to get your lazy ass fired you fucking bitch.

**AW:**(suddenly polite again) Hi, I came to buy some stone.

I'm not happy as I wasted several hours driving here when she **knew** I was coming to get it. 

**Boss:** I was here yesterday when Rusty told you we don't have any in stock. She advised you when it would be in and offered to call you when it was in. She *also* offered you free shipping due to the inconvenience of not having it when you want it. 

You have come in here, abused her, acted extremely violently and told her that she is just choosing not to sell it to you. Do you think we would just decide not to sell to a customer that is so keen to hand over their money?

Guess what mate, you are right, we don't want your money and you can fuck off out of here. Take your fucking card *picks it up off the counter and throws it at him* and piss off. Don't come back. 

**AW:** Fine, I'm going to your competitor (insert name here) anyway. They were better to deal with than you dumbasses. *Storms out the door, reverses out of the parking spot hitting a large concrete planter and damaging his nice new Audi before pulling into the street, cutting a cop off and getting pulled over.*

The boss laughed, stood out the front and openly pointed and laughed as the guy got dealt with by the cop, before calling our competitor and giving them the heads up (though we run in direct competition with each other, we warn about fuckwits so staff don't have to get abused). 
He then shouted me a pizza for lunch and we laughed at the look of the guys face when the boss had a go at him.

I came in at 4:30pm and assumed my spot at the register. Not 15 minutes later, a middle aged woman walks in. 
Her: ""I paid $23.99 for this cat food when the food rep that was here told me it was $9.99."" I wanted to tell her to learn to read labels. 

So I called the manager. I'm not in the mood to argue with this crazy lady. I was enjoying the peace and quiet because it was dead in my store. So the manager goes back and talks to her and shows her the food, then they walk up to the cash register and the manager refunds the difference because we just don't care at that point. No use in arguing. 

While my manager is refunding the money, the lady walks up to me and says ""Wasn't Nutro recalled? That's the food I bought!""

Me: ""No ma'am, Natura was recalled. That's why there's a huge empty spot where the Innova food used to be."" 

Her: ""But I *saw it on the internet*!""

Me: *internally facepalming* ""No, Natura was recalled, NOT Nutro...""

Her: *Talking to phone* Google Natura! *pulls up website* It's on the FDA website! See!"" 

Me: ""Yes, NATURA was recalled NUTRO was not. You've got them mixed up!""

Her: ""B-b-but it's right here!"" 

Me: ""Are you accusing me of selling recalled food? I take that *VERY* seriously. I know the recalls before they are even announced. I took that product off the shelf. You can take the lot numbers from that site and you're welcome to go check the dog and cat food sections because I would never sell recalled products.""

Her: ""But they sound so alike.""

I deliver pizzas around town for a local pizza joint that starts with a D. I've been doing this for a few months now and I've gotten to become familiar with some of the customers who ordered alot. One of them was the mother of one of my old girlfriends in high school, so I knew her quite well and she ordered probably twice a week while I was working, not sure how often she ordered any other time.

Anyways, one time I showed up and she was short two dollars so She was very kind to me even in break up so I didn't mind returning the favor. I told her it was fine, I'd cover it. I went to the car and took 2 dollars out of my wallet and used it to pay up what she missed. No big deal.

Anyways, this happened again the next week. She was short five dollars this time, and once again I paid the difference. This happened every time that I delivered to her house for about a month I'd say. And I probably didnt get every single one of her deliveries. I figured it was just something that she did with me, but I was wrong.

Apparently, she had begun doing this to other drivers too and when they refused to give her order to her, she said ""well that nice boy Ryan lets me have my pizzas for half off."" 

As you can imagine, this got me into quite a bit of trouble with management. The next time I delivered to her place I told her what happened and how I didn't appreciate her taking advantage of me and the other drivers, so she paid and I was on my way, thinking that the problem was solved.

I was off on the day after that, but when I returned to work two days later I was fired. Apparently, she called back and told them that I had given her two extra pizzas than she ordered for free and she was calling because it hurt her conscience to know that she was taking advantage of the company. As you can expect, that was total bullshit and I didn't even give her the pizza she ordered for free, nevermind two extras that would've belonged to other customers. 

Here's the real kicker though. My manager said that another female customer called in that same night and said that their pizza didn't arrive. It's fishy but I get the feeling it was her daughter, my ex, and they were fucking with me, but I like to think the best in people.

winter_storm,51,,95,16wxkq,,423,"Up until June of 2012, all liquor in Washington State was sold in state run stores.  We clerks were employees of the state, and had to follow stict guidelines for all sales.  For instance, we could be fired if we sold alcohol to someone who appeared to be intoxicated.  Also, if one clerk refused a sale, no other clerk was allowed to sell to that customer.  So...

One day I was stocking shelves and my coworker, let's call her Guadalupe, was on the register.  We were the only two clerks on the sales floor, as our manager was a boob who rarely left the office, even if there was trouble in the lobby.  This meant that, as the Senior Clerk, I was in charge.  

I was just opening a case of tequila to stock when Guadalupe surreptitiously sidled up to me and, in her thick Hispanic accent, pointed out a customer at the back of the store.  He seemed to be having trouble keeping his balance, and was swaying back and forth as he studied the vodka section.  Guadalupe told me that if he came up to her register, she intended to refuse service, as she suspected that he was drunk.  I agreed, and assured her that I would back her up if he became irate, as inebriated customers often do.

Sure enough, the man tried to purchase some vodka, and got very angry when he was refused service.  I heard Guadalupe very patiently and politely explain that it was state policy, and even point out the (giant!) sign stating that we do not serve customers who appear to be intoxicated.  He started screaming in a very heavy Russian accent that he wasn't an alcoholic and what kind of person did we think he was?  So I went over to him and tried again to explain our policy.  He would not listen, and shouted at us that he was going to call the police!

He stomped out of the store (nearly colliding with the doorframe), pulled out his cell and made a call.  He spent the next 40 or so minutes furiously pacing back and forth in front of our store, until.....a policeman arrived.  Guadalupe and I watched him yell at the policeman for a few minutes, and then the policeman entered the store.  

He asked me if I had refused the sale, and I replied that it was Guadalupe, but that I absolutely agreed with her decision.  The policeman looked surprised, turned to Guadalupe, and asked if it was true that she had refused the sale.  She, of course, admitted that it was.  

The policeman started laughing.  When he was done, he informed us that the man had called in and reported us for discrimination.  He said that we wouldn't sell to him because he was a foreigner!  But, after seeing the obvioulsy drunken man, and hearing Guadalupe's accent, he concluded that this was a false allegation.  

The intoxicated man, meanwhile, was outside smirking very smugly at us through the window.  Obviously, he expected the policeman to reprimand us and demand that we sell him the vodka.  He was very pleased with himself.

The policeman thanked us and went back outside to the waiting man and spoke to him.  I don't know what he said, but we could see the man visibly deflate more and more with each passing second.  Then the policeman pointed away from the store, obviously sending the man off.  And, on top of that, he sat in his patrol car and made sure that he didn't get into a car and try to drive away!

sweetsrmything,259,,103,19vw45,,423,"You guys are awesome and I'm excited to post my second story.


As I stated previously, I worked at a well known video game store. This tale of yore happened mere days after starting in the wonderful world of retail. I was young, naive, and was excited about selling something I loved so much. 


It was early, 9 in the morning and I had just driven up in my crappy '88 Honda accord. The day was full of possibilities. Quickly jumping out of my car I noticed a man much older than myself, I being a mere 18 years of age, coming out of the store. I thought nothing of it as I skipped in youthful merriment into my place of employ. The bell sounded, I waved happily at my Boss at the time, Josh, and headed for the back to place around my neck the vestige of most retail employees. The name tag.


Hearing the bell ring again, sounding the entrance of a potential costumer, I darted back out with a grin on my face. I was surprised to see the gentleman from before had reentered the store. In my naivety, I thought, *Surely he just decided he wanted something else as well.* I clocked in and smiled brightly as he stared confusedly at the computer games.


I glanced at Josh, who was hard at work putting away the daily deliveries. I shrugged and headed over.


Me: Hi, Welcome to &amp;lt;Game store&gt;, I'm sweetsrmything. How can I help you today?


Man: uh...yeah...uh...I'm looking for a computer game, do you have anything you'd suggest?


Me: Well I just got into WoW. 


I proceeded to tell him about all the games I enjoyed on the computer and why, he eventually settled on World of Warcraft and I helped him to the register to check him out, having easily spent half an hour working with him. Not a big deal, he was our only customer at the time. I happily chatted with the man as I rang up his game and time card. 


Then, I made my first mistake.


Me: Can I help you find anything else?


Man: Yes, you could help me find your phone number.


I froze, surely I'd misheard. I was only 18, a mere 5' 3"" and 110 pounds looking far younger than I actually was. This...gentleman, was easily my father's age. His striped polo pinned shirt was tucked awkwardly into his slightly baggy pants, which flooded far above his ankles. His long white socks easily visible, one bunched the other straight. He wore no belt. I could see my shocked expression gleam from his beginning to bald head, his gray hair reminding me of one of my mother's horses. His mustache was astounding, like one you would find from the seventies, and his Coke bottle glasses accentuated the shine of anticipation and hope in his beady eyes.


I was flummoxed. I had never been in a situation where a man so much older than myself had clearly been attracted to me. I hurriedly wondered how my friendly nature could be so misconstrued.


I glanced desperately at Josh, not knowing how to handle the situation. I was shocked to see him hunched over a game case, giggling like a madman. I thought quickly, how do I make this man leave me alone.


I lied.


My second mistake.


Me: I'm.... sixteen.


Man: So?


He smiled! SMILED at me. I was horrified, I stared in abhorrent wonder at this man ahead of me. I couldn't believe the horror I felt at that single word. I slowly, so very very slowly, shook my head. In a quiet voice I muttered, no. 


He seemed surprised by my answer, and suddenly dejected. He made no fuss, and just took his items and receipt. Like a kicked dog he slunk out of the store, never to be seen again. 


I turned to Josh and in utter bewilderment asked, ""What the hell was that??""

Stocking the shelfs around the kitchen displays, when I saw a customer throw some empty packaging in a display drawer. 

I picked up the packaging and followed him outside and asked if he can come back inside he dose, the manager sees this an watches in.

I asked if he threw these in the drawer he denies it and starts claiming harassment or some shit.

I ask him to just handover the goods and we'll just bar him and that's all.

He pulls a knife and says this is all I have, raises it eye level.

I look at the packaging he stole some fancy light switches I tell him just to fuck off, my life is not worth £30 of light switches.

I start calling the police on my mobile, when the manager comes over and tells me to meet him in his office.

He fires me on the spot said something about commitment to the business.

TL;DR
I've been risking my life for a long time on tours, manager at a local DIY shop fires me for not getting cut up for £30 worth of stolen stock.

Edit;

Just to put things in perspective.

It was a new store and the store manager was younger than me. God only knows how someone so young made it to that position, my opinion was that he worked the shaft, HARD.
He would always pick on me for dumb stuff, like the one time not putting enough shrink wrap on a pallet before fork lifting it on a top shelf, he would make a major thing of it like a formal meeting about it with witnesses and a scribe. So in a way I was happy to go.

As to policy, I was doing what I was instructed, explained the situation to the customer and he was cool with everything.  Near the end of the transaction here comes co-worker.

""Don't you think you should've given him a full refund?  He only bought it recently and if our manager were here, she would've done it.""

She said this right in front of the customer.  I didn't say anything to her and just continued with the transaction, but the customer, from that point on, looked visibly upset.  Which is what I didn't want because I know the return policy isn't the greatest.  But it's what I have to work with because I'm not the manager and therefore, can't make calls like that without managerial approval (which my co-worker seems to forget).  So I try to make the experience as pleasurable as possible because that's what the customer deserves.

Anyway, days pass and this co-worker cannot let it go.  She keeps mentioning it and saying what she would have done, how she spoke to our manager about it and our manager said that I should've just did the return (still haven't heard a peep from my manager on the issue to verify)--

cabeleirae,71,,79,1kx4ey,,420,"When I was 17 I worked at a large big box pet food retail store that also sold aquarium fish, small reptiles and rodents, etc.  This family used to come in all the time shopping for fish for their aquarium, and they had a young adult **severely autistic son** who was unable to verbally communicate.  They would take their time walking the aisles and viewing all the fish, and their son seemed really calmed by it and found it very enjoyable.

WELL,

One day, the family came by, wandered the aisles for a bit, and then suddenly I saw the mom walk out the store.  The autistic adult son was still there, calmly viewing the fish and enjoying himself.  Soon thereafter I saw his older brother leave, and then it was just him.  He wasn't causing any trouble at first and was minding his own business really, until about 20 minutes passed and he realized that has family was gone.  As I said before he was unable to verbally communicate, so his communicating consisted of grunts and groans, along with pointing and other physical movements.  I'm not sure what emotions he was experiencing, but after another **HOUR AND A HALF** passed, he began to get very upset and frustrated.  

He wanted us to bag some fish for him, we refused because we knew he didn't have money, and had no way of traveling home in time to get the fish in their aquarium before they died. After about another 20 minutes of him getting increasingly frustrated, he left the fish area and got a cart, then began filling it with candy bars from the checkout line. He dumped about every candy bar we had out into his cart (hundreds), and then waiting in line, and then once he got to the front he began putting them on the counter.  The cashier didn't really know how to handle it because again, she knew he didn't have any money, and he was loudly grunting and yelling at her and vigorously gesturing in a threatening way.  The Manager on Duty that night was one of our assistant managers, and she too was not sure of what to do.  The cashier was calmly telling him that he couldn't buy the candy, which got him more frustrated and he stormed away and began pulling some dog food bags off the shelves.  As I said before he was in his late teens/early twenties, about 6'3"", and clearly very angry and frustrated.  Luckily at this time it was about close, and my manager said we would wait another 20 minutes for his family to come back before calling the police.  After they didn't show, we called the police, and it took the police about another half hour to arrive.  But of course just as the police showed up, his mother and brother did. She acted very worried and said things like ""Oh we didn't know where he went! We're so glad he came here! Of course this is the last place we looked. I'm so sorry officer, we were so scared blah blah blah""  WELL, I witnessed the two of them knowingly leave him in the store.  My manager politely told them that he could not be in our store anymore unsupervised because it was a disruption.  They left in a huff, still denying they had left him intentionally.

While I am sure living with someone that has a disability is extremely difficult and that ""breaks"" are needed from time to time, but seriously? I couldn't believe that someone would abandoned their special needs family member in a store just to get away from them for awhile. Jesus.

They came back a few weeks later, and I saw the mom and him come in, her lead him to the fish area, then head for the door.  I ran after her, grabbed her and looked her straight in the eye and said ""You cannot leave him here. That is wrong."" She stared at my 17-year-old self silently for a moment before stuttering ""... I ... I was just getting my wallet out of my car..."" Then walked back in the store. She scooped him up and they left together. I didn't see them there again before I quit a few months later.

So, when people stay late, they write it down on the schedule, no big deal right? Wrong. My boss will white out any extra time put on the schedule. He refuses to pay anyone for any extra time because, and I quote, ""I am the boss. I make the rules"".

woman: I dont want suite! I want regular room! You go kick someone out and let me have room!

woman: WELL I STILL WANT a ROOM AT MY SPECIAL PRICE!

Me (envying the dead at this point): Like I said, there are none of those available.

woman: I know you lying! You have plenty of rooms!

JacOfAllTrades,36,,86,12bfie,,421,"About a year ago, I had a gentleman in his thirties come into the store. I started with the regular spiel, and he said, “I need to furnish a whole house.” Uh, yes, sir! His house was being built and was due to be finished in a few weeks, making it the opportune time to buy our made-to-order furniture, because it can take 6 weeks to get here, but as I was selling, he never really had an opinion on any of it, just kept asking for mine. I’d push a little, “This or this?” and might get a response more than, “Which do you like?” but not by much. It was really very odd. Then I asked this question: Do you have any other furniture to incorporate with the new? He said, “No, nothing.” I figured kicked out/divorced. I didn’t ask, but he decided to explain, “My wife left me.”

Me: Oh, I’m sorry.

Him: She had Lupus.

Me: That’s very unfortunate.

Here is where the story actually begins. He goes on to explain to me that they had gotten married about ten years before, and he worked in oil (didn’t look like a roughneck, but I didn’t ask) and was away a lot, so she spent the her time in school, earning a bachelors and then a masters. Shortly after she got her masters, she was diagnosed with Lupus. They put her on steroids, as is the norm, and everything seemed to be mostly okay, except every time he talked to her she said the steroids made her fat and she had half a mind to stop taking them. He’d tell her, “No, take your meds,” and when he was home he always saw her taking them and she really didn’t seem to be gaining too much weight, so he didn’t think anything more of it than that she was noticing her jeans getting a little tighter. One day he got a call from his mother-in-law saying that his wife was unconscious in the hospital and her kidneys were in failure. When he arrived, they had her on IV steroids, the failure had started to reverse, and she apologized to everyone, told them she hadn’t been taking her meds because she didn’t want to get fat, said it wouldn’t happen again, and so on. A couple weeks later, he had to go back to work, and she was doing well and back on oral steroids, so it seemed life was back to normal. Until she died. She had gone back to live with her mother, and apparently her husband was the only one who actually watched her take the pills, so when he left, she stopped and no one noticed.

This is where is gets kinda crazy.

Her family blames him for her death, and decides to sue. They want everything of hers, period, doesn’t matter if it was shared or not, and want half the value of the house. Judging from the way he told the story, I believe they were harassing him and threatening to sue, not that they actually did sue, but I don’t know any of that for sure. So he packed up her personal belongings (family pictures, personal jewelry, and other personal mementos) in a box and mailed it to her mother, and then donated the house and everything in it to charity, including both cars. He said that if they wanted to sue a church, that was their business. He bought a new car, bought a new house (that was in the process of being built), and was set to leave it all behind.

Now, I’m sure you can all imagine that there is absolutely nothing that can come out of my mouth at this point other than, “Wow.” He looked me dead in the eyes and said, “And don’t accuse me of being a heartless bastard, because she left me for her pant size.” Yes, sir.

After the story, he was more receptive to picking out his stuff, and he sure enough did buy an entire house of furniture. Today I saw him at a local restaurant, and I, of course, had not forgotten him, but I was a little surprised when he waved at me and came over to the cash where I was. He thanked me because when he walked into the store last year he felt like he killed his wife, and when he started to tell me the story, he realized it was her decision and her doing, and he couldn’t beat himself up over it forever. He paid for my milkshake, thanked me again, and left.

It was a weird experience all around, but I will definitely never forget that customer.

My bosses reasoning? ""Being a woman, you can't lift as much as the guys can."" He was sexist and I was young and didn't know any better. My actual job title was price integrity coordinator, which meant I was responsible for price changes throughout the store. But, I also held keys, opened and closed the store, ran the front end, ran a register, stocked, did receiving and on occasion even jumped into specialty departments like floral or framing. Essentially, I ran the store on 75 cents over minimum wage. 

**The day I quit**: It was in the midst of Black Friday chaos. I had been working since 4am, and it was now about 8am. All 10 registers were rolling and the front end manager had pulled a no call no show. I was the only one in the store at that time able to make change for tills and had thought all my price changes were fine and set before we left Wednesday night (closed on Thanksgiving).

So, I'm in the front office, making cash drops and change for a few registers. My manager comes storming in, holding some papers. Apparently, sometime in the last 24 hours over the holiday corporate sent down some price changes for a small end cap of about 15 products. Something that could wait until change was made and cash was dropped, which I was almost done doing. Leaving over $1000 worth of cash in a drawer is not a good idea. Also, changing the prices would take no time, after I was done my task. 

I calmly explain to him that I'm in midst of dropping thousands of dollars worth of cash and making some change for some cashiers. NO! That wasn't good enough for him. He INSISTED I drop everything I was doing and change the prices. I stayed calm, he started getting angry and frustrated. We went back and forth, and I peered out the front office window at the long line of customers. I turn back to him, grab my store keys, and toss them to him. 

""You can find someone else to run your store. I quit."" And I walked out. Clocked out, collected my things and left. All the while ignoring him following behind me begging me to stay, begging me to help him get through the Black Friday madness. He even promised me a 15 cent raise. Oh boy!

We do offer a rent-to-own option, but the more patient and budget conscious customer may choose to take advantage of our layaway program. No fees or interest, but you don't get to take the item home until it's paid in full.

One fine day when I'm filling in on sales, a couple customers are browsing the store. One customer is a regular... she's a bit of a quack (often calling the store drunk to ask about a purchase), but we don't mind her because she buys the most expensive items and she shops often... buying things for herself, as well as her fully grown adult children. We'll call her Drunk Quack. The other customer is yet another regular; she comes in about once a week to pay on her layaway account. She's a chubby, quiet lady who we'll call Chubby Lady. 

Chubby Lady browsing for a few moments while I'm helping Drunk Quack. I leave Drunk Quack to thumb through a couple catalogs while I ring Chubby Lady's layaway payment out. She leaves and shortly after that, Drunk Quack leaves, stating that she'll talk to her hubby and be back. 

Not even a half hour later, the phone rings and it's Drunk Quack. She has also obviously enjoyed a few beverages since she got home. 

Me: ""Thank you for calling [store name], this is Jen, how may I help you?"" 

Drunk Quack (slurring): ""HI JEN! You know that pregnant girl who was in the store when I was there?"" 

I'm slightly confused. There was only one other person there... Chubby Lady... she is chubby, but CLEARLY not in a pregnant sort of way.

Me: ""Ummmm... I think I know who you're talking about."" 

Drunk Quack: ""She was paying for something on layaway. What was she buying? She can't afford anything for her baby?""

Me: ""She's paying on a television.""

Drunk Quack (suddenly enraged): ""WHAT?! Why is she buying a goddamn television?! SHE SHOULD BE BUYING BABY THINGS!!! I was going to buy her crib for her... but she's not buying a crib! SHE DOESN'T DESERVE MY HELP NOW!!!"" 

She slams the phone down. I don't even know what to say. Some people... maybe I should have mentioned that I had just found out I was pregnant. Free baby stuff? Why not?

batnuna,32,,107,1hn3u5,,421,"Hey guys!  
So... I work at a retail store in Israel, where we sell computers, smartphones, etc.  
I've been working there for a couple of years now, and I've had my share of abrasive customers. Today, however, was the first time that I've actually refused service to a customer.

Our stores are usually pretty busy. We have a tech-support bar in-store, where people come to get help for their products.   
Usually they have a line of people waiting for service, so every customer that buys anything in our stores is advised to schedule an appointment (by phone or online) before they arrive for support, so they won't have to wait.

So today, this guy comes in. I finish with a customer and offer my assistance. Before I even get to ask what his name was, he began to complain about how he's been waiting there for over 10 minutes (though I saw him come in approximately 90 seconds earlier) and how rude we are for not coming to help him immediately.

After about a minute of listening to him complain about the service, he finally told me why he came in. Turns out that his Apple TV has stopped working, so he came in to get it looked at. When I asked if he had set up an appointment, he said ""no I haven't. I'm here now, so I expect service now, and **don't give me that face**"".   
What face? I have no idea. That's my regular face! Should I be insulted?

I told him that I noticed there were quite a few people waiting in line, so he can either stay there and wait until every person with an appointment had been given service, or I will gladly set him up with one for tomorrow or some other day.

That wasn't a smart thing to say, apparently. He was visibly angry, saying that when he bought his device at one of our other stores ""they wasted my time for over an hour, **and you're wasting my time right now**"".  
I told him that I'm sorry that he had a bad experience at the other store, and that I'm just trying to help. He answered by saying ""so what are you waiting for? So far, **all you've done is annoy me**"".

I was obviously quite stunned by that. I began a sentence by saying something that roughly translates to ""listen, man"", and he cut me off by saying ""I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother, **so watch your mouth**"".

At this point, I've had enough, so I told him that if he wants he can go talk to someone else, because I'm not willing to continue this conversation.
I walked back to the office to get a drink of water and regain my composure. My manager was there, so I told him what happened, knowing that he'll probably need to face the guy in a few minutes. 
Not 10 seconds later, the guy **steps into the office**, screaming that he demands to see the manager right now.

After we got him to go outside, my manager, who is awesome, told the guy that after the way he spoke to me, it would be best if he would set up an appointment and come back another day.

sxcamaro,104,,76,1hzd8s,,415,"10 years of retail (clothing/sports) have shown me the dark side of many customers I have helped. From lazy to crazy, I have seen some stuff in my time.

Today I had an experience unlike any other. A customer calls in to ask if we have various common items, which we always stock. The customer also asks if someone would help ""get the items"". I said, ""sure, not a problem"".

An hour later a middle aged man (tall and in shape) in a suit walks in, grabs a folding chair and a shopping cart and sits at the front of the store. When he is asked if he needs help he tells our cashier, ""somebody needs to get these items for me, because they told me they would"". Confused the cashier asks me to come to the front and help the customer.

When I asked the man if he needed help, he became quite agitated and raised his voice. ""Well, how many times are you people going to ask me the same questions!? Just get the stuff so I can leave already!"" I asked what he needed and was handed a stack of papers printed off the our online website (probably 30-35 pages of items with sizes/colors written next to the items and quantities. I called my manager for help at this point and met him while gathering the items. 

My manager found the situation odd and went to talk to the customer, while 3 other associates rounded up the merchandise. My manager came back agitated and told us to ""get the asshole out of here pronto"" he wouldn't say why (but promised further explanation later).

Checkout total was just south of a grand and the customer had two cards declined. He blamed our cashier calling her an idiot, and then thankfully the third card went through. We then had to load the bags of merchandise into his car, while he waited.

After leaving our manager told us that the customer had informed him he could not walk around the store it was beneath him. He said ""your people get paid to do this, they can earn their keep today"". He had to walk away or he would have said some awful things to him, and I'm sure we'll receive a nasty complaint that corporate will harass us about. ",Nightmare customer,491,talesFromRetail

Firamaxis,84,,63,18d9lq,,414,"More independently owned game store tales!

Last week I had an irate mother of two come in and attempt to return a game she purchased before christmas. I explained to her that it is past the return date. She raises her voice and demands a refund. I again explain that she cannot return the game nor get a refund since she bought the game over a month ago. She starts pacing and calling me a racist and sexist and to 'return the god-damn game you sexist asshole or I will have you fired!'

I have a low tolerance for dramatics in my little store (yelling in a confined space is a terrible idea) so I am at the end of my niceness rope.

""I want to talk to your manager!""

I smile, tell her right away ma'am, turn around for a second and take a breath, and then turn right back around.
""What seems to be the issue ma'am?""

She just about exploded. More yelling, more cursing, more name calling. Right about that time our area security guards come by because they patrol and heard her shouting. She starts her bitching at them and accuses me of lying to her and that I am preventing her from complaining to the manager. The poor security guards are confused since they know I am the manager and dont understand why she thinks I am not the manager.

She wasn't listening to me or the guards, so they gave me the option of asking her to leave the premises. I ask to to please leave and say that i am sorry she cannot return the game.She gets pissed,crumples up the receipt, and throws it at me and leaves.

perseus287,17,,64,17xoti,,415,"About a year back I worked in a major US clothing outlet.  We weren't paid on commission or anything, but our sales were closely tracked and management was constantly breathing down our necks to make sure we were selling as many overpriced ties and shirts as possible.

On this particular day the regional sales manager was shadowing our store. I had met the fellow before and knew he didn't like me- I'm usually a pretty quiet guy, and the manager was of the opinion that only obnoxiously boisterous people could properly sell clothing. At the beginning of my shift I heard him complaining to the floor manager (in hushed tones, but loudly enough that he knew I could hear) that I had been left on the men's side of the floor alone since he didn't think I could sell.

It was a fairly quiet night and I wound up spending most of it talking to a customer who had just landed a job and was looking for a new suit.  I would walk over to this customer, talk to him for a bit, then walk around to help any other customers on my side.  Whenever I was talking to him and looked up I would see the regional manager watching me, clearly impatient that I hadn't closed the sale yet.

Three hours later the customer checks out as we're closing the store.  He purchased a complete suit, three ties, three shirts, and two belts, a total just slightly shy of $1000. He complemented the floor manager (who was ringing him out) about how friendly and knowledgeable the service was.

SheepdogCabbie,29,,80,1lmtha,,414,"I worked at a small grocery store from 2007 to 2011, so I've got quite a few stories to tell. This one is about one of our regulars, who was nothing but a huge asshole both as a customer and a person. I'll call him Mike. At first Mike seemed okay, but as we got to know him we grew to hate him, and eventually (after this incident) banned him from the store. Later on his kids ended up taken in custody and Mike ended up in jail.

So, on to the story. The shift started usually enough, I was taking care of the register and shelving some stuff that's near the counter. My boss comes to me and asks if I've seen the PDA-type-thing that's used for checking inventory, ordering stuff, marking up products that are spoiled etc. We have two of them, and now that one is missing I was using the only one we had. I tell her no, and that it's been missing since yesterday. She flips her shit (not at me though, since it's not my fault and she was an AWESOME boss to work for) because they're actually rented to the store, and they cost pretty much to replace if you lose one. So we figure out that it'll turn up later, and go on about our work as best we can, since we now have to work with just one of them.

Later on that day Mike comes in to the store, goes about his business, and then when he's at the register he puts his master plan to work.


&gt; &lt;Normal interaction between me and Mike while ringing up his groceries&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Mike: Oh hey, I found this just outside the store, is it yours?  
&gt; (By now it was obvious to me that he'd stolen it and tried to play a scam)
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Oh yeah! We've been looking for that! Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Mike: So, do you have a finders fee or something?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I'll have to check with my boss, just a second

Please note that I could've just as easily told him to fuck off and never come back again, since she trusted my judgement enough to let me ban people.

So my boss comes over, and I tell her what's going on. Mike keeps asking for free stuff/money/cigarettes/whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: So you found this outside the store?
&gt; 
&gt; Mike: Yes! Right in front of the doors!
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: Bullshit, it's been missing since yesterday, and when I opened the store this morning it certainly wasn't there. Get out before I call the police on you.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike: WHAT? I really found it there! Do you think I took it from the store and am now returning it so I'd get a finders fee?
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: No, I think you tried to sell it first, but nobody wanted to buy it because nobody has any use to it but us, so NOW you try to return it to us and get even a little bit something. Now get out and never come back.

This went on for a while and escalated into a yelling match with profanities. My boss handed Mike his ass, as was her style when confronted by assholes.

EDIT: Whoops, the title says ""earlier today"", even though the PDA had been missing since the day before the incident. It's been a good three years since this happened, so I was kinda hazy on the specifics.

sierrahax,81,,57,1brx05,,413,"This isn't necessarily retail, more customer service, and there isn't a TalesFromCoatcheck, so I was thinking you guys would appreciate this story all the same.
 
First, a little backstory. I supply staff for most raves in my city, and throughout the night, I'm normally running the coat check. I love what I do, but because these are raves, obviously a lot of the people I deal with are high as fuck on one thing or another. Keep in mind, since I took over the coat check for one organizer in particular over a year ago, not a single thing has ever gone missing/gotten stolen from the coat check.

So one night I'm running the coat check, my girls and I are keeping things running smoothly, up until disaster strikes. One girl brought her ticket up, and the girl dealing with her couldn't find her coat. I take the girl's ticket and go looking myself, and the hanger with the matching ticket attached is empty. I go see the girl and ask her to describe her jacket. 

""Black canada goose jacket with fur on the hood""

*facepalm*

So I spend, I kid you not, two hours checking every jacket in my coat check, and cannot find hers anywhere. I call one of the organizers to coat check, as nothing has ever gone missing before, and I'm not quite sure what to do.  The girl spends an hour fighting with us, demanding we give her the $600 her jacket costs. I remind her we have signs stating we are not responsible for any lost or stolen items, but she is welcome to come into the coat check with me and look for her jacket.

Obviously she is not pleased with this, and I tell her the only other option is to wait until the end of the rave, and see if we can find her jacket then.

She keeps fighting with us, and eventually I stop and turn to her and say what was going through both mine and the organizer's minds the whole time: 

""I'm sorry your stuff is missing, but in all honesty, who brings a $600 dollar canada goose jacket to a goddamn illegal rave?!""

And this is the best part. An hour later, my friend comes inside with a jacket, saying he found it in the snow outside. I found the girl and showed it to her. Her reply?

""Oh that's right. I forgot it outside! teehee""

Guys? Hello?

Anyways, besides all the calls we receive for *Cablesight*, we get a myraid of telemarketers.  The three most common ones are 1.) You've been selected for a free cruise  2.) You've been selected for a free home security system, and 3.) You may be eligible for a small business loan from the government for free.  

After several requests to have our number removed from the lists, we started messing with them.  I mean fuck it, they are scams.  Just wanna get you to give away your info.  So why not mess with them?  Here's a couple scenarios we went through.

**Security System Scenario #1**:

Scammer: Hi, thank you for holding. My name is Douchbag Scammer.  How are you today?

Me: I'm fine thank you.

S: So you're interested in our FREE home security system.  (He really liked to stress the word FREE).

M: Yes sir.  I got a neighbor whose spying on me, and I want to put an end to it.

S:  Oh well neighbors can be annoying sir.

M: Not like this. This guy works for the government. He's spying on me, I know it. This system is just what I need. But I could never afford one. Credit got destroyed when I went to jail.

S: Jail?

M: Yea but that bitch deserved it. Anyways, now that I got an alarm system, I can invite him over, set the alarm, and when he trips it I can shoot him dead and say he tried breaking in.  It's the law.

S: umm. Sir. I don't think you can do that.

Me: Don't tell me that, I know my rights. Someone breaks in and I can kill him dead.  I'll get rid of that fucker reeeeaaal quick. 

*Scammer hangs up*

**SecurityScenerio #2**: (I'll just skip ahead to where they ask if I'm interested in the system)

S: So you wan't to know about our free system?

M: Yes but I had some questions first.

S: Go ahead sir.

M: So this is for doors AND windows right?

S: Yes sir.  

M: And I can set the alarm, and still be in the house, long as no one opens the doors.

S: Yes sir.

M: Good. I'll tell you. My daughter just turned 14, and I caught her sucking her b/f's cock the other day when I followed them out on their ""date"". Can you believe it, my baby, A WHORE!  I tell you it took all my rage not to murder that little bastard b/f of hers.

S: Uhhh....

M: You have a daughter?

S: N...No sir.

M: Well let me tell you. You don't know rage until you see someone's balls resting on your daughters chin. (at this point, I almost lost it, because my co worker is next to me, and couldn't hold in his laughter anymore)

S: Well that's a shame sir.  If we could just get your info we cou...

M: I tell you, I'll make sure that slut doesn't get out there to suck anymore guys off. I'm sure she has a reputation.  If she's anything like her mother, she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.  

S: Sir I'm not really comfortable with this.

M: I know I'm sorry for unloading on you.  I also want to make sure that you send a female installation tech.  If a guy shows up he better be castrated cuz he aint gonna get near my daughter.  She's a whore, and I know how these things go. If a male shows up I'll kick his ass then come kick yours.  Put your security system to the test, you feel me boy?

*Hangs up*

**Security Scenario #3** (Note: For this one I gave a really germanic name. Like Victor Von Shaft or something)

Me: So this will connect to fire and police and EMS right?

S: Yes sir it will.

M: There is a way to leave a special note for my account right?

S: A special note?

M: Well you see, it's a delicate situation. My parents are both gone, and my grandmother is somehow still kicking.  She tends to wander out of the house a lot, and we want to keep her inside.

S: I'm sorry to hear that. My grandfather had alzheimer's and tended to wander. I know it's not easy.

M: Well she's not senile. She's perfectly sound for someone her age.  It's more of the fact of our neighborhood.

S: Neighborhood?

M: Well, we live down the street from a Jewish retirement home.  And you know old people. Always holding a grudge.  Grandma never was very forgiving after the Nuremburg trials.  Grandpa was stoic and accepting of what had happened, but Grandma has always been outspoken about it all.  It can be a hassle. You know how it goes right?  Despite the evidence, people just think this so called ""Holocaust""  *ACTUALLY* happened.  Crazy right?  But anyways, we just want to avoid issues with her going and yelling shit at the people there.  

*Hangs up the phone*

**Free Small Business Loan from the Government Scam**:  
(Once again skipped all the unnecessary introduction parts)

Scammer: So you have a small business?

M: Well no. Not per se.  But I am in the middle of a venture at the moment, does that qualify?

S: Well is it a business?

M: Well. No. I'm writing a play that I hope to perform for the world.

S: Well actually we can work with that I think. What is the play about?

M: Well, it's hopefully, depending on licensing, going to be a musical version of Harry Potter.

S: Well that sounds nice. A lot of kids would like that.

M: Well it's not for kids. You see the entire thing will be performed in the nude.

S:  In the....

M: Nude. Yes. It will envoke the real essence of magic from the HP universe.  You've read the books right? Imagine that world, full of beautiful naked human beings, just being themselves, not ashamed and hiding.

S:..... I don't think we can fund this.

M: Please. You have to. I quit my job for this. Everyone else said it was crazy.  I just stay in and write all day. I'm on the last book. Im *SO CLOSE*. My wife even left me, saying I was creepy and obsessive over it.

S: Well I'd have left you to.  I know you think you're being funny, but it's not.

M: It's better than scamming people out of money. Let alone sticking around for a call to a security office where everything is being recorded.

S: Recorded? 

M: Yup. Everything  logged and recorded audio too.  Isn't technology grand?  I can do all that just as easily as you steal information from your victims.

QWOP_Sparkle,157,,92,1jsrz8,,404,"I recently discovered this subreddit and thought I need a rant about requesting ID, especially from young teenagers.

I work at a big cinema company in the north of England, we get a lot of 15 rated films there and because of a police incident that happened a few years back, we've become extremely strict in ID policies. We must ID EVERYONE. We have signs EVERYWHERE.

But of course, kids don't understand ID at such a young age and we have to deal with a lot of bullshit. Here are some stories just from this years summer holidays:

**But I liked Simon Pegg!**

Opening day for *The Worlds End*, thankfully a lot of teenagers have brought in ID. Two young irish lads come up to the tills requesting if they can see the new Simon Pegg film, note one of them is really quiet and the other extremely cocky, they look like they're 10. I ask how old they are 'I'm 11, he's 12.'.

Me &gt; I'm sorry but you aren't allowed to watch this film by law, as it's an age restricted film

CockyOne &gt; What? Well that's bullshit. I've seen every single Simon Pegg film ever.

Me &gt; Well I'm sorry but you can't see this film in cinemas, you're too young, the only other film on at the moment you can see is Despicable Me 2.

CO &gt; What? Fuck that, how old do you think I am?! Just let me in for Simon Pegg

Me (any patience I've had gone) &gt; No. You're not seeing a film today. Bye!

CO &gt; Well we'll just come back tomorrow then!

They came back the next day. And the next day. And the next day. They never saw the film.


**Are you working tomorrow? I wanna watch the film and you won't let me!**


Final film of the night, *The Worlds End*, 3 young lads come in who look 14. Request ID.

GlassesDude &gt; Are you being serious?

Me &gt; Yes. I need to see ID or you can't see the film.

All 3 walk out, assuming they're getting ID of some kind.  They come back 20 minutes later as me and my coworker are cleaning and sorting the retail stand.

GlassesDude &gt; So, are you working tomorrow? You've IDed me and I can't get any ever and I wanna watch the film so I'll just come in tomorrow.

...wut.

Me &gt; Well, maybe? I'm not saying. But thanks for letting me know. I'll tell my other co-workers.

GlassesDude &gt; WHAT. But I've come in for a 15 before and never been IDed!

Me &gt; What films were they?

This list was brilliant by the way.

GlassesDude &gt; Fast and Furious! Woman in Black! Avengers! (Wut)

Me &gt; Well...all those films you've mentioned are actually a 12A, I'm pretty sure Avengers was a PG.

GlassesDude &gt; Oh...*storms out*

He came back the next day. He never watched a film.


**Someone won't let these girls in so I'll buy them their tickets!**


Last week, *The Heat* came out in cinemas, which is popular amongst all the young girls. Children note, dressing like a slut will not stop you from being ID'd.

So these 4 girls came in who looked borderline 15 were dressed in the smallest dresses I'd ever seen, fake tan, orange faces, monkey lips, everything. They wanted to see The Heat.

Me &gt; Sure, can I see some ID?

One presents ID, the rest haven't got any. She only turned 15  a month ago. Suspicious brows.

Me &gt; OK thank you, has anyone else got any?

Other 3 girls give blank stares, isn't 1 form of ID enough for all them? Wut no. They leave. 1 comes back with ID.

Notice that she only turned 15 5 days ago. Suspecting the other 2.

Me &gt; OK thanks, you and your friend can go in but I can't let the other 2 in without ID.

Remaining2 &gt; But we can't get any! Can't you just have our word? We can show you our facebook accounts!

Please note, facebook is not a legal form of ID.

Me &gt; No, I need ID or you can't see the film.


They leave and some middle aged woman with no bra and nipple-ons comes storming in asking for 4 teen tickets for this film. I ask who it's for as its an age restricted product.

NippleLady &gt; Well some woman won't let them in without ID and it's ridiculous so I'll buy their tickets instead!

Me &gt; That was me who ID'd them, I'm sorry but by law I can't let them in without proof of age.

NippleLady &gt; WELL LET ME SPEAK TO A MANAGER THEN THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS.


Call out my manager, who is awesome and doesn't take shit from anybody. This lady had the look of 'If I speak to the manager she'll apologise and let my kids in'. Nope.jpeg.

NippleLady &gt; Hi, you're members of staff won't let my daughter or her friends in for a film without ID. I can vouch for them so can I please have 4 tickets for The Heat?

AwesomeManager &gt; I'm sorry, but without proof of age we  can't let them in. Once ID has been requested we need to see it by law. 15 rated films are treat the same as an 18 and age rated products -

This woman literally has stopped listening and loses her shit.

NippleLady &gt; THIS IS MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS. YOU THINK I WOULD LIE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS CINEMA. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE.

M &gt; I can respect that you may know them but I don't know if you are actually related to her, we can let the girls in who have ID but we can't let anybody else in. There are plenty of other film options available.

NippleLady &gt; I want the name of YOUR manager NOW and I want your name written down I want to complain about you not doing your job.

M &gt; Certainly, my name is [managername] and I am the regional and general manager of this cinema. I run everything here, my name is also on the website along with a customer service number for complaints. All complaints from this region are forwarded to me.

Woman is speechless, storms out, throwing profanities, threatening to sue, calling us useless. etc.

CreatrixAnima,29,,77,1httjx,,409,"Because our store could become very busy with people wanting deli items, we tended to let only one employee wait on a customer, rather than having 3 of us helping the same person.  If there was only one customer, the other employees would work on the other shift work.  We also tended to talk while we worked.  It isn't as though deli work demanded our utmost attention.  You can slice a pound of ham and discuss things simultaneously without your work suffering, right?

So on the day in question, I was working with two other employees.  One was waiting on a customer and I was talking with the other, who was a 16 year old girl whose father was in the hospital and probably dying.  It was not a frivolous conversation.  

That's when the bitchy customer - a lady who was not obese, but kind of big and probably pregnant - said ""You know, I'm in a hurry, so maybe you could stop chatting and help me so I can get out of here.""  Had she asked nicely, I would have helped her, but I was angry that she thought her fucking deli meat - which she WAS getting - was more important than this little girl whose father was dying, so bitchy employee - as in me - told her only one person could help her at a time.  And then I proceeded to NOT help with her order.  

Afterwards, I started to feel kind of bad and resolved to apologize when I saw her next.  A few weeks went by before I saw her again.  I went up to here in the aisle and said ""Hey, I wanted to apologize to you about the last time you were here.  The girl I was talking with was upset because her father was dying.  He's since passed away.""

Then something awesome happened.  She said ""Oh, I was kind of rude, too.  I'm sorry.  I had actually just begun labor and I was uncomfortable and cranky and wanted to go home.  I had my baby later that night.""

skremnjava,73,,90,1kt1dd,,407,"Hi all, this is my first post here, I've really been enjoying reading these stories, although some are really blood-boiling, its unbelievable how people can act.  Anyway, I've worked in retail jobs and food service for many years, even worked as a manager for a few years, and I have seen some shit in my time. This story happened about a year ago when I was working in a wine/beer store as a cashier. WARNING: This will be long.

There were 3 of us working that day, I was on register, my manager was at the computer 10 feet away, and the third guy was helping 2 customers pick out wine.  The 2 customers were both black females, and really young looking.  When I am on register, I pay attention to people in the store, I notice who they come in with, who is shopping with who, and whatnot.  I noticed that both of these girls were asking questions about wine, both picking up and looking at bottles, and thats fine, because when you come to my register, I am going to ask both of you for ID.

So here they come, they have selected 14 bottles of our finest $4.00 wines, apparently it is for the older one's wedding that weekend.  I ask for both IDs, and I see the younger one look down at the floor. Trouble brewing.  I check the older girl's ID, and she has just turned 21 recently.  I ask, how old is she? The older one says ""shes my 17 year old sister.""  From here on out, the older girl will be referred to as BrideZilla (BZ) as the younger sister didn't say anything.  I walked over to my manager, who was 10 feet away, to clear this sale with him, since it was only slightly suspicious to me.  You are not allowed to be in my store if you are under 21, unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Brothers, sisters, boyfriends, girlfriends, and cousins are not legal guardians, we get these types all the time.  I was not going to refuse the sale to BZ, I was just making sure I was in the clear with management.  This action took approximately 15-20 seconds.

Before my manager could say ""thats ok"" (he was going to,) BZ throws a fit. ""I dont need to put up with this!!  This is ridiculous I can't believe you're doing this to me!! I'm not buying these, I am taking my business elsewhere, and I am NEVER coming back here again!!!"" And she storms out the door with her young sister behind her.  We were all shocked, wow, are you serious? Even the manager was dumbfounded at how unnecessary that was.  Just then the phone rings, there is a truck delivery at the back door, so the manager asks me to watch the front, while he and the 3rd employee go receive the truck. Sure! no problem, it was a slow day anyway. I had some work that needed to get done, and I had walked down an aisle to grab something, where I could still see my register, and people walking into the store from that vantage point. 5 minutes later, GUESS WHO COMES BACK? (they always come back, dont they?)  This time, she has someone else with her, a black male that I assumed was her fiancee, I never found out for sure.  He will be referenced as Cool Fiancee (CF) because he was pretty cool.

Even though I am half way across the store, I hear BZ say to CF ""that stupid white boy over there"" while pointing at me. Oh hell no. Hell no. She didnt yell it, but I heard it.  So I start walking towards them, its not like I could run away.  I go up to the same computer my manager had been using, and pretend like I'm doing something.  CF approaches me, and calmly, politely asks what has happened?  BZ is running her mouth, insult, insult, insult. CF keeps telling her to stop, stop, go outside, I got this.  She is having none of it.  I explain what happened, that we don't allow minors in the store, and that no one refused her sale, that she had stormed off on her own. BZ hears this and insults me more, again and again. CF keeps trying to get her to leave the store, to stop running her mouth like that.

CF looks at me and asks ""is there anything I can do?""  I was really impressed with him, he did a great job keeping his cool.  Just then, a customer walks into the store with her 2 very small children.  BZ starts yelling at this customer ""THEY CANT BE IN HERE!! THOSE KIDS CANT BE IN HERE!!!"" I said to the woman, ""Dont worry ma'am you're fine.""  BZ yells at me ""OH SO SHE CAN BRING HER KIDS IN HERE BUT NOT ME???"" ""No, you are not your sister's guardian, I'm sorry.""

Another customer came to my register to check out, so I went over to ring them up.  CF and BZ follow me of course.  BZ is still running her mouth, insulting me as I am checking this other customer out.  Once again, CF asks if there is anything he can do.  I turn around, look him in the eyes, and I say, ""OK, I am going to sell the wine to you.""  I was really fed up at this point and just wanted them to leave.  He thanks me, and says he will be right back, he needed to go get a wine corkscrew from the accessories aisle. I say ok.  So I was going to reward BZ for her terrible behavior, she was going to get what she wanted.

Did she shut the fuck up and stop insulting me?  Well, this is Tales From Retail, take you best guess.  She KEEPS GOING, calling me an idiot, calling me racist.  The woman with her 2 small kids are now at my register to pay for her wine.  I turn back around to BZ and look at her and say ""I'm sorry but you're going to have to step outside while he pays for this wine.""  BZ keeps it real. ""I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?? YOU AINT NO ONE!!! NO ONE!!!""  All I can do is sigh. Loudly.  I yell out to CF, ""Excuse me! Sir? Sir!""  He sees me. I say, ""We're done here.""  He doesn't say anything, he knows its over, he just walks back towards her looking shamed and completely embarrassed.  I really felt bad for him, I mean, he was getting married to that creature. As he was walking out, I said sorry man, he said its ok.

The woman with her 2 kids, still at my register, said that I absolutely did the right thing, and thanked me for the good job I was doing.  I mean how stupid do you have to be?  You're getting what you want, and you cant shut your freaking mouth for 5 seconds.  Furthermore, if you say you're never coming back, can't you make that a promise?  CF ended up coming back later that night to buy the wine after I went home. Oh well.","""That stupid white boy""",497,talesFromRetail
hockey_puck,140,,104,158ga3,,411,"After college I couldn't find a job, so I started working as a waitress at a 24-hour restaurant.  I opted to work the midnight shift, as it paid more and afforded me the opportunity for me to get more hours.  Since my place of employment borders on a rather bad neighbourhood, we have a security guard monitoring the premises all night long.  On my shift we have two waitresses (myself included), a cook, and the security guard on the premises.  There is no manager or shift leader present.

We have a regular customer, Lenny, who is about 6'5"" tall and weighs at least a solid 300 lbs that really, really likes to hug female employees.  He is also slightly mentally handicapped, but is still functional enough to have obtained a commercial driver's license (he is a trucker) and live on his own.  Most of the other waitresses allow him to hug them and ""get it out of his system.""  (These being the same waitresses who sit on customers' laps and flirt heavily for tips, and see nothing wrong with staying with abusive or cheating boyfriends.  Not exactly women's rights advocates, here.)  I, on the other hand, really don't appreciate physical contact from strangers.  My usual coworker, Angela, feels the same way.

Now, Lenny's ""hugs"" are not your typical hugs.  He only hugs women, and also seems to enjoy fondling women's bra-straps during the hug.  He also forces these hugs on people, grabbing them and pulling them in HARD if they don't reciprocate the hug.

After being taken aback and rather upset my first encounter and forced hug from Lenny, I couldn't exactly yell at him to get the hell off me, as that would probably have resulted in my being fired.  I started resisting by standing behind the counter to take his order.  He walked around it and hugged me anyway.  I tried anticipating the hug and backing away quickly, to no avail.  Extending my hand for a handshake was equally fruitless.  Planting my feet firmly on the ground to avoid being pulled in when he approached didn't work, either.  I'm barely 100 lbs and rather petite, so no matter what I did, I'd be physically overpowered and have my face smashed into Lenny's smelly, unwashed man-boobs while he fondled my bra-strap every time.  Angela and I would trade off on who had to wait on him, and neither of our strong nonverbal cues worked.  Whoever wasn't waiting on him had to hide in the back, because he'd hug whatever females he saw.

A few weeks ago, Angela had the night off and I was working with a male server who we'll call Bruce.  Bruce, knowing how I felt about Lenny and his hugs, offered to wait on him in my stead.  I was very grateful, and started sweeping up the back to keep myself busy and out of Lenny's sight.  As soon as Bruce approached Lenny with the menu, Lenny started yelling and cursing, saying he didn't want Bruce waiting on him and demanding to know where I was.  Bruce and the security guard managed to calm him down, and Bruce waited on him anyway.

Later that day, when Bruce and I told our boss what happened, she said that she flat-out didn't believe us; that Lenny was just a ""big Teddy Bear"" and that she had never seen him act in a hostile manner toward anyone.  She did not take our complaint seriously, and pretty much thought we were lying.

Lenny came in again a few days later.  i was off for the night, and Angela was working with another girl.  Lenny hugged the other girl first, which made her extremely uncomfortable.  When he went to hug Angela, she stepped back quickly and said, ""Please don't touch me.  I don't like hugs.""  Lenny started screaming and yelling, and made such a commotion that both the cook and the security guard approached and escorted him from the building.  Apparently my boss was informed, and had a talk with Lenny, telling him that he must respect the personal space of others, ask before hugging, and keep his cool or he would not be allowed to return.

Fast forward to two nights ago.  It's nearly 5am, and Angela and I are almost finished with our shift.  It has been a very slow night, and the restaurant is peppered with a few (mostly elderly) coffee-drinkers who are quietly watching the weather report.  Lenny lumbers in, and stands near the counter.  Aware of Angela's previous incident, I volunteer to wait on him, and approach him with a menu.  He walks around the counter, goes in to hug me, and places his hand on my back.  Being very careful to keep my tone and expression as pleasant as possible (figuring that he reacted poorly to Angela due to her brusqueness), I quietly say, ""Please don't, sir.""

And that's when all Hell breaks loose.

Lenny starts yelling and screaming and cursing.  The only words I could make out were, ""If you don't want to be friendly, then I won't be fucking friendly!  I can be REAL FUCKING MEAN!""  I take a few steps back toward the doorway leading to the server line.  In a single bound, he is practically nose-to-nose with me, screaming at an unbelievable volume and making threats and flailing his arms about.  He had clearly lost control, and I was fairly shocked and terrified.  Angela, who had walked up behind me by this point, grabs me by the elbow and yanks me through the doorway and out of sight.  The cook RUNS out to get the security guard.  Lenny continues his tirade until the security guard approaches and asks him to leave.  I can't see what is happening at this point, but I can hear Lenny start screaming even louder.  I hear a few loud THUDS and peek out to make sure the security guard is okay.  Lenny is throwing things and kicking things and knocking things over and having a violent tantrum near the front doors.  The few other customers are looking on in silence, wide-eyed and too afraid to stop Lenny because of his massive size.  

The security guard, having lost control of the situation, tells Angela to call the police.  She dials 911, and is explaining to the dispatcher what is going on when the shift leader for the next shift, Liz, walks in.  Liz is a veteran waitress, having worked at this particular restaurant for over a decade, but is still shocked to see the commotion in the dining room.  She asks me about it, and I manage to blurt out that Lenny started raging when I asked him not to hug me.  Liz, apparently having balls of steel, walks out into the dining room and approaches Lenny.  I excuse myself outside at this point, to get some air.

When I returned a few minutes later, Lenny was sitting down at the counter chatting with Liz.  I asked Angela what happened, and she said that Liz invited Lenny to stay and eat, allowing him to hug her in the process, and assuring him that he wouldn't be denied any more hugs...which apparently calmed him down.  Angela was FUMING.  As she finishes telling me this, a police officer approaches us.  The officer in question is an almost nightly customer of ours, whom we know rather well.  As Angela explains the story to him, Liz walks up and essentially tells the officer to go away, and that nothing is wrong and she'd gotten it under control.  The cop sees the horrified looks on my and Angela's faces, shakes his head, and leaves.  Liz then allowed Angela and me to hide in the back until Lenny left the premises, fearing right along with us that he might snap again or lash out at one of us if we got too close.  She told us to just let him hug us next time, regardless of whether we want to, to keep the guy happy.  I was rather appalled by this response from a shift-leader, but there was nothing I could do.  When I spoke with my boss, she said she'd ""talk to"" Lenny again.

As of today, the situation has still not been handled, I am still expected to submit myself to unwanted ""hugs,"" and I am frantically looking for a new job.  Sorry for the wall of text; I'm pretty pissed off.

**TL;DR: Customer got so angry when I asked him not to hug me that he screamed, threatened us, and nearly destroyed the restaurant.  I was told to allow him to hug me, and he is still allowed in the restaurant.**","Apparently, accepting unwanted physical contact and verbal assault are part of a waitress's job description.",515,talesFromRetail
sneakerpimp87,50,,59,ybq7j,,408,"I had dinner at a restaurant a few nights ago.  One of those chains that makes burgers, steaks, fish, pasta, etc.  Nothing fancy but not fast food either.  Anyway, the waiter we had was fantastic.  When I was asking him about the new additions to the menu and how spicy they were, he was very helpful, asked me a few questions about what I liked, suggested something else that he thought I would like better, and said he would make sure it wasn't made spicy (I don't like spicy food).  The food was absolutely delicious, my mother's food was too (he suggested that dish to her), he was attentive, polite, and an all-around great server.  I made sure to thank him, and gave him a good tip.  Now, what made me feel kinda sad for servers was this:  I saw the restaurant manager walk by our table while we were eating, so I flagged her down.  As soon as I said I wanted to say something about our server, she got this terrified look on her face.  When I was finished telling her how happy we were with his suggestions and his attentiveness, she sighed and said; ""Oh!  Well, thank you, yes, we do like him a lot here!  I was just afraid you were going to say he was horrible or something because no one ever talks to me to say anything NICE.""

Above_an_F,56,,81,1k1cgs,,408,"I don’t work in retail, per say, but I thought this would be the best place to post this.  I have now worked in a public library a bit of time and I have seen some strange things.  

**Background:** I am a female college student in my 20s and, by far, the youngest employee of the library.  Usually, I handle the computers, the teen room, and occasionally the textbook area.  Here are some of the incidents I have encountered in my short time here:


**IDENTITY THIEF**
This happened during my first month.  I was working the circulation desk (where people check out books) and an older gentleman comes up to me.  He says hello, asks how I am doing, and seems very pleasant.  He then asks if I could look up a book for him about gardening.  I ask for the name of the book, and I find it in the system for him.  It is, unfortunately, already checked out so I offer to place it on hold for him. He agrees and I ask for his library card.  He lets me know that he actually is new to the area and doesn’t have one yet but would like to get one.  No problem.  I just need to see proof that he lives in the city limits.  He pulls out a bill that has his name and address and I tell him I just need to see some ID, preferably a license.  This is when he goes ape shit.  

He yells: “I KNEW IT! I KNEW THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO STEAL MY IDENTITY! YOU AINT GETTING MY BRAIN, YOU’LL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT I KNOW FOR YOURSELF!” He then pulls out little bits of paper from his pocket, throws them in the air, and runs out the door. Never saw him again.


**PRINT, PLEASE, THANK YOU**
At this point I had moved to working at a different desk where I took care of people who needed to print things.  A Chinese man comes up to my desk and holds out his flash drive and says “Print, please”.  I try to ask him exactly what he needs, but soon realize that he doesn’t speak English.  I tell myself that I will try to help him as best as I can and take his flash drive.  I open it up and, of course, none of the files are in English. I ask him which file, and show him the screen and he says: “Thank you. Print, please”.  Although more frustrated, I decided to continuing helping.  I opened up each file and each time he shook his head no until we reached the file he wanted.  Keep in mind, there were about 100 files on this flash drive.  Eventually, we made it to the paper he needed to print and it ended up being a sign-up sheet for a class to learn English.  It had taken 20 minutes, but when he saw his paper he beamed and said “Please print, thank you!”


**ITS OKAY, I’M A TEEN**
This story wasn’t that frustrating, just kind of scary for me.
The library has a teen room that they reserve only for teens.  Others can go in and grab any book they want, but the computers, desks, and couches in there are meant just for teens.  They have that rule because more teens are likely to come if they have their own spot.  Teens are anyone who is anyone between 12-20 years old. 

One day, a man goes and sits on one of the computers.  It was incredibly obvious he wasn’t a teen.  I let him know the rules about the room and he says that he didn’t know.  I go back to my station.  15 minutes later, I look over and he is there again.  Now this isn’t someone who is bordering on maybe being a teen, he is a big, burly, black man that was at least 40 years old.  I let him know again that he can’t be there and that there are computers elsewhere.  

He smiles at me with what teeth he has left, and we have this dialogue:

Man: Looking me up and down “It’s alright sweet thang, I’m a teen”

Me: “Sir, it’s obvious that you aren’t. I’m going to have to ask you to use a computer elsewhere in the library.”

Man: “I promise, it’s okay, I’m a teen.  It must be your girl hormones getting all worked up over how manly I look”

At this point he is trying to get near me and touch me so I exit the room and go to my desk.  From my computer I shut down his account so he can’t use that computer.  He comes up to me, fuming, and says his computer is broken and that I have to fix it.  He was getting too close to me.  I told him that our system was fine, and that that computer must be broken but he could try another computer if he wanted.  

Man: “Bitch, I ain’t payin’ for your shit computer. Fuck off”

And then he left the library.  


**THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR**
I was now working the information desk where I helped people find a book they were looking for.  A man comes in and mumbles a bit and asks me where the romance section was.  I point him in the direction, he thanks me and leaves.  Another man then comes up and he starts asking for a book recommendation and we start chatting about various books.  The other man then comes back, pushes the person out of his way and looks at me angrily.

Mumbling man (MM): *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir, I didn’t get that, could you speak up”

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR.  THE SECTION WAS THE WRONG ONE. WHERE ARE YOUR GRAPHIC NOVELS”

Assuming he meant comics and such, I sent him to the graphic novels section.  I continue helping other patrons.  

About 5 minutes later he comes back, angrier.

MM:  *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir, could you repeat that”

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR. AHH! THAT WAS 
WRONG TOO! WHERE ARE YOUR MAGAZINES”

He was yelling loudly but it is my job to help him so I pointed him to the magazines.  At this point, I was catching on to what he actually wanted and asked our security guard to stand near me in case he decided to get physical.  The man comes back, as expected, and this time he is fuming.

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, ARE YOU A RETARD”

Me: “Sir, if you would calm down and let me know what you are looking for, I could help”

MM: “FINE. I’m looking for your exotic section”

Me: “Our…exotic section?”

MM: “Yes. Your pornography. Books, magazines, DVDs if you got ‘em”

Me: “Sir, this is a public library, we have no pornography of any sort”

MM: “Oh. You sure?”
Me: “100% positive”

MM: “Oh. I guess that makes sense.  That’s alright. I'll just find something else to read”

He leaves and heads off into the Children's department. At this point the security guard follows him and eventually escorts him off the premises.


I have lots more stories and will post them later if I have time.
",Stories From a Public Library,489,talesFromRetail
dragongrl,43,,87,1ezskn,,411,"This isn't exactly retail, but I did have customers to deal with.  About a decade ago, My (ex)-boyfriend and I were living together, and he got an offer to manage one of those self storage facilities. You know the places, like the one you see on those reality auction shows. He was also able to bring me along as his assistant manager.  I have many stories from that place.  This is the best (worst) of them.

Now, a big selling point of this place was it had an apartment where the manager would live, so someone was on premises at all times.  The manager would live there, rent and utilities free.  Now, while it was a great idea in theory, in practice, it was its own special kind of hell.

We had this one customer, let's call her S, who was about a hundred and fifty years old.  She lived alone, was a hoarder, and her son and the town forced her to take out some storage rooms to get some of the crap out of her house.  Lucky us, we got her.  She needed some help moving, mainly because her kids wanted nothing to do with her, so my ex (let's call him X) called these guys who specialized in rubbish removal, because he figured they'd be best best equipped to deal with the disaster her house was.  

When they arrived at the storage place, they were so not happy.  R, they guy who was in charge, told us that they dumped the worst of the stuff while S wasn't looking, because it was too gross to be moved, and S freaked out whenever they threw anything away.  The other guys just kept shaking their heads and muttering about ""feces"" and ""bugs giving birth to other bugs.""  R didn't talk to X for a while after that.

S would come by the storage place to, I don't know, hang out with her stuff I guess.  Sometimes she'd come into the office and sit in the chairs and mumble at us.  We'd ignore her and eventually she'd wander out, but leave a nice big wet spot on the chair.  Good thing she could only drive about 5 mph, because we'd see her coming and quickly wrap the chairs in plastic wrap, telling her she had to sit on the plastic because we just had them cleaned.

One day she comes in and goes into the bathroom.  At first, I'm thrilled.  ""Yes!"" I say to myself, ""she's going to piss in the bathroom and not on the seats!""  But then 10 minutes goes by.  Then 20.  30.  By 45 I'm starting to freak out.  ""Oh no, she died in there.  I can't deal with that."" I'm thinking as I knock on the door.  ""You ok S?""  I call and almost fall over in relief when I get an answer of ""I'm not dead yet!"" through the door.  Thank whoever, she's alive.

The door cracks open.  ""Excuse me, may I have another garbage bag?"" S asks meekly.  And this smell...oh my glob, the smell.  I jump out of my seat and go over to the bathroom.  ""Another garbage bag?  S, what did you do?""  She tries to block me from seeing into the room, but she's only about 4 feet tall, so I easily see over her.

It's shit.  The room is covered in shit.  It's everywhere.  It's on the toilet.  It's on the sink.  It's on the floor.  It's on the walls.  It's on the...

""S....what....did....you....do?""  I gasp. 

She glares at me ""I'm sick.  Haven't you ever been sick?""

""Yeah, but not on the floor and the walls and the how did you get it on the CEILING??"" I just couldn't go on.

S just stands there and stares at me.  ""Aren't you going to clean it up?"" she demands.

 X comes in at this point (I forget where he was), sees the disaster.  He always had a weak stomach, and turned completely green.  

I groan, knowing I'm going to have to deal with this.  ""She needs to go,"" I tell him as I go in search of cleaning supplies.  ""She needs to go now.""

S then bends over to get her purse.  It's at this point I realize, (she had a long coat on) she's not wearing pants.  Or underpants.  Nothing.  I saw IT in all of IT's glory.  IT looked like a purple wallet with red lollipop sticking out of it.  X gets a pair of his own sweatpants and gives them to S.  He gets her out of the office before I completely lose it and immediately gets her son on the phone.  S needs someone to take care of her, obviously, and her son needed to step up.

I lost track of how much time I spent in the bathroom, scrubbing it down.  I scrubbed and bleached and lysoled and scrubbed again and bleached again.  The shit (no pun intended) was everywhere.  I guess she had tried to clean it up, but just ended up smearing it.  I found the garbage bag that was in there, full of shitty clothes and paper towels.  The bag was warm.  I'll never forget that.

Anyway, my employees have to explain this to every single guest who comes in. It was the first Saturday we were open so we were very busy. I hear some guy raising his voice from my office so I go to investigate and my attendant is walking over with an annoyed look on his face and says ""he wants to talk to a manager."" I walk over and this huge bald guy in a suit and his huge wife are standing there. I say ""how may I help you"" and he looks at is ugly wife and says ""look at this fucking asshole, probably just a little bitch for the owners."" I keep calm and say ""did you need help?"" and he said ""give me a fuckin access card so I can go play craps."" I say ""sure thing, that will be 10 dollars each."" He said ""I ain'y paying, just give me the fucking card."" I stand silent and stare at him in the eyes for a long 30 seconds. He said ""is this guy fucking serious? JUST GIVE ME A FUCKIN CARD!"" I ask ""is that usually effective?"" ""What the fuck do you mean?"" ""Is treating complete strangers like they are pieces of shit on your shoe usually effective?"" He said, with his nose in the air ""I always get what I want."" I said ""Not today, get the fuck out of the casino."" He was so shocked he looked stupid and he stormed away.  I got a round of applause from the customers and my employees who were listening.

The asshole finds a guy in a suit (CEO) and starts shouting about me and how I cursed him off. The CEO comes overs and asked what happened, I explained to him what the guest said (backed by my employees and a few other customers) and the CEO said ""well you heard him, get the fuck out of my casino.""

baconpieguy,33,,71,1i558k,,404,"Sorry for the big wall of text.  It's my first time posting to TFR.  Hope you like it!

I used to work in a music store.  We sold all the usual good stuff. Guitars, drums, horns, DJ gear.... you get the picture. For the most part, we had pretty good customers.  A nice blend of kids getting their first instruments, home pickers, seasoned pros.  We even had a couple minor/former celebrity types that would come through on occasion.  We also had our fair share of douchebags.  Musicians, right?  We're a special breed.  

The one guy who sticks out most in my mind was a guy in his late 50's, let's call him Don.  Now Don was the sort of regular that all of the staff cringed at the sight of.  He was short with a protruding beer gut, draped with oversized rings and chains, and drove a loud firebird complete with the giant emblem painted across the entire hood of the car.  He was incredibly self important and would frequently butt into staff conversations with customers so he could give his very own opinions on whatever they were talking about.  And he loved to name drop.  I've never seen someone drop so many names in a single conversation!

So there we were one sunny afternoon and all was going well.  In comes Don who immediately makes a bee line for our one guy who seems to indulge/tolerate his usual hot air.  I'm at the counter as well restringing a guitar so I get to listen to our hero go on and on about his many conversations with Joe 90s Rockstar who is not only going to produce Don's new album, but is going to bring Don in as a session player on his own new album.  

Restringing a guitar is pretty simple stuff, so I'm just taking my time with it as I listen to the hot air flowing to my right.  A customer comes up from my left and I look up to see none other but Joe 90's himself!  He was the type that had his 15 minutes back in the early 90's and then faded into general obscurity, his One Big Song still getting a bit of radio play here and there.  He's local, as regular a guy as can be, and stops into the shop from time to time for a bit of gear or some fresh sets of strings.  I greet him with the usual ""Hey Mr. 90's.  How's things?  That everything today? etc."" and start ringing his purchase through.  My colleague looks over with a grin and says ""Oh hey Joe.  Don here was just telling me you guys have a couple big projects coming up together""  
Well Don turns to spot Joe and gets this huge deer-in-headlights look in his eyes.  Joe just takes a look at him and says ""Buddy, I don't even know you""
Don's response is to stammer for a second or two while turning beet red before making a hasty exit.
Joe, for his part, just finishes up his purchase and we talk a little shop about the new strings he's checking out, then he heads out.  
I left that job shortly after so I never found out if Don ever came back or if there was any follow up to the incident.  Still... it felt really good to see a name dropper get called on his actions like that.

SoSoSoulGlo,30,,96,1nytb8,,407,"As my handle might suggest, I am Black American. I also happen to come from Flushing, Queens, where the vast population is Chinese; Flushing is probably one of the most culturally diverse neighborhoods in New York. I'm very proud to be a part of such a multi-cultural community.

So, I proudly identify as being Black, but I suppose I can see how  my complexion and facial features might not make that so obvious. I get mistaken for many different races; no big deal.

A few years ago, I was working at the membership counter of the local wholesale club. I couldn't find any other work after college, but this job at least paid my phone bill if nothing else. Anyway, day in and out, I had to stand there through all kinds of crazy-ass shit: I'd watch people break out into fist-fights over the bottle return machine, I'd get yelled at in Chinese ... for not knowing how to speak Chinese (a bilingual co-worker translated that convo for me later), I even had a customer try to sell me meth once.

One day, this *very* drunk Asian man approached me at the counter, and stared me down. I swear, it was like he wanted to confront me on some personal issue. Of course, he made me very nervous, so to break the ice, I began with:

**Me:** Hi there! What can I help you with today?

*He reeks of alcohol, but continues to stare at me as though he's puzzled.*

**Me:** Sir -?

**Him:** (*His accent was thick*) What *are* you?

**Me:** Caught off guard, I begin to laugh. *Excuse me?*

**Him:** You Spanish, right?

**Me:** No, I'm Black actually. (*Why was I entertaining him???*)

He looks at me quizzically, then he looks to the entrance, where my Senegalese friend is standing guard. His eyes dart back to me.

**Him:** (whispering) *No.*

**Me:** I don't need to argue with you. (*The whole time, I'm laughing, because I'm in complete disbelief.*)

**And word-for-word, play-by-play ...** *Forgive me here ...*

**Him:** You no black. 

He points at the black phone on the desk.

**Him:** *This* black.

My eyes widen. Then, he points to my African friend at the entrance.

**Him:** *He* black.

He steps back a step, and gives me another puzzled look-over, and then slaps the counter as this lightning bolt of an idea strikes him ...

**Him: YOU NO BLACK! YOU CHOCOLATE ASIAN!**

He's cracking himself the hell up, and I can't help myself either. This shit is ridiculous!

He stumbled out the club, and that was it.

AmishHomeboy,83,,96,1klgby,,403,"What's up /r/TalesFromRetail? Today I need to complain about an incident with my boss so WALL OF TEXT WARNING:

so let me begin by saying I work 3rd shift 8 and a half hours without a break at a gas station. When the end of my shift arrives I'm tired, ornery from dealing with customers, and ready to go to bed. Well, first shift is normally the manager and assistant manager so they are the ones who relieve me from my shift. The boss has showed up over an hour late more times than I can count but the most frustrating and irritating thing they do is after they both clock in and the assistant manager puts her till in the register and they ask me if I can watch it for a few minutes while they go smoke a cigarette. So I always tell them yes (which yes, I know I should of learned by now) and every single goddamn time they smoke like 5 to 6 cigarettes each and talk to each other. Leaving me to watch the register for over a half hour every single time. I just worked all night while they slept, and they asked me to do them a favor and they take advantage of me. Every. Fucking. Time. Which inferiorities me to no end. All the other coworkers who have asked me to watch their register while they go smoke are considerate and only smoke one and as fast as they can and if they see I'm getting busy they will put it out and come inside to help me. Not the manager and the assistant manager, they go talk behind the dumpster and don't care if I'm getting swamped by the morning rush or not, and I've never heard a thank you once. It's ungrateful, inconsiderate, and unfair. 

Now me being a non-smoker working at night I have time to kill, so I will occasionally enjoy a ""fresh air break"" for ten minutes or so a night especially if a customer I like is smoking outside I'll go have a chat with them. Well, we have this one regular customer who's about my age who comes in almost every night after he works and buys a tea and maybe a pack of smokes, we'll call him Chris, and everyone who works a late second and third know him very well because he's friendly and talks to everyone. 

Well me and him hit it off really well and have conversations sometimes when he comes in. One night he asked if I wanted to chat outside while he had a cigarette so I said yes. While we were talking the assistant manager pulled up to get gas so I come inside and ring her up then go back out and continue talking to Chris. We got carried away and talked a little longer then normal, but it didn't stop me from getting my 3rd shift duties done so I didn't think anything of it. 

The next morning the assistant manager comes in and asks to talk to me for a second. Apparently after she filled up her tank she parked across the street and watched us talk for about 25 minutes and bitched me out for it saying I can't get anything done if all I do is talk and it's my job to stop talking to the customers and not allow them to hang around the station. So I was annoyed since she takes multiple smoke breaks all day and has left me to watch her register while she smokes for a fucking half hour almost every morning I work but I understand where she was coming from (sorta). The manager heard the ""talk"" and asks me if this is a customer she should have a talk with, I tell her no and that I'll just tell him we can't talk as long as that again. 

The next time Chris comes in I jokingly say ""hey! You got me trouble"" and he says ""yeah, I got myself in trouble"" which took me by surprise ""what do you mean?""

Apparently the manager took it upon herself to have that talk with Chris anyway (in front of other customers who were in the store at the time). She had a 15 to 20 minute talk with him about how it was wrong for him to distract me from my work and he needs to buy his stuff and just leave instead talking to her employees. He was talked down to and humiliated by the manager of the gas station he frequents. I'm sorry but I find this wildly unprofessional. I understand the reasons for my talk but she has no right to lecture a regular customer who spends his money here. 

Chris emailed the corporate office to inform them of the situation and will be calling to file a complaint. I haven't heard the results of that yet... Needless to say, I'll have to get home as soon as possible when they ask me to watch the register while they smoke from now on.

leveraction1970,138,,118,17fk3r,,407,"I've worked retail, off and on, for about 16-17 years. When I shop or do whatever it is that customers do in stores I tend to be friendly with the employees as I feel their pain. I do my best not to be the asshole customer that stories will be told about later. 

A few years back I needed a new bed so I decided to move up from a queen sized bed to a king sized bed. Mostly because, fuck it, it would fit in my bedroom. Like an idiot it didn't occur to me that none of my queen sized sheets and bedding would fit the new bed. So I head to a store that rhymes with arget. 

I get in line with a new set of sheets, a mattress pad, a blanket and a new comforter. When I get to the cashier, all of 16 and nervous looking, I give her a friendly smile while she rings though my stuff. This is the conversation we had. 

her - ""Wow you've got a whole new set of bedding."" 

me - ""I needed it. You'd be surprised how much blood is in a 95 pound Asian hooker.""  

her (after she stopped ringing and turned slowly to me) ""Seriously?""

me - ""Yeah, because I killed a hooker and thought I'd randomly confess it to you."" 

her - ""Really?"" 

me - ""No."" 

As I was walking out I turned back and saw her waving a woman who I assume was the head cashier over to her register. She looked at me nervously as she did this. I waited in the parking lot for a few minutes to see if the cops were going to show up.

AlotOfPhenol,92,,79,1jterm,,403,"For context, I work at an apparel store with a strong membership program. Our return policy is sixty days for any reason and we give you back your money in your original form of payment as long as the item is UNWORN. You wore your item and then decided it didn't really go with the rest of your wardrobe or it's past our sixty day return period? No problem! We'll just give you merchandise credit for the price that you paid for the item, or if you prefer, feel free to exchange it for something else.

It was closing time at our store and I was working on checking out the last crowd of customers. All was well when I hear the word “manager” escape from the lady that my coworker is checking out. I mentally brace myself and finish up with my transaction then walk over to my very pregnant coworker and her transaction. In the five seconds it took me to walk over there, our customer turned to yelling. I will call her Grouchypants. GP for short.

AoP: How can I help you?

Grouchypants: I am in a hurry and I need to return this coat. I will be fine if you put it back on my credit card or if you give me cash back. I need to pay a bill today before they close at 9!

AoP: (I glance at the receipt) As my cashier explained to you, you are returning this coat well past our sixty day return policy. I will be happy to give you the money you paid for in a merchandise credit. They never expire and you can use it to find something else in our store you like better.

GP: I want cash back.

AoP: (now studying the receipt more closely) Miss, it would appear you used a merchandise credit from our store to pay for your coat. Even if we override the system to allow you to get a refund for this item, it would go back to a merchandise credit because that's what you originally paid with(!!!)

GP: Can't you just put it back to my credit card?!

AoP: Miss, I can't give you credit back because that is not what you paid with. You didn't paid with a credit card. You paid with merchandise credit. At this point, I should mention that the only way you get merchandise credit is if a cashier gives it to you when you do a worn or past 60-day return, so I already know this lady has returned something in the past, probably worn, too.

GP: (shouting) I need to take care of my mother with Alzheimer's! Just give me the cash! It's just 37 dollars!

AoP (recognizing this isn't going anywhere) I can let you speak with my manager, but that is not going to change our answer. She will tell you the same thing (I call for a manager on my headset to come to the front).

GP: (Angrily) Just ask her over the walkie! I need to go!

AoP: Ma'am. It's ten minutes past 9. You said it yourself. Everything is closed including our store. This is an issue for which I want to speak to my manager in person, so I am going to call her up here so that she can try to help you. It would really be in your best interest to let me get her up here because if you really want money back, she has to be physically present for the transaction, anyhow. Isn't that what you want?

GP: (grumbles) 

So I go back to my customers, who are laughing at this lady and talking to me about how she needs to stop shouting and just leave. My manager arrives and she tells her: NO. The reason? “Because you didn't pay with cash. I can't give you cash back.” GP starts getting louder and saying stupid things like she will sue us and blahblah and then my manager does something very genius on her part: She approves the return and puts the money on her credit card, writes down her name and relevant information. The lady smugly leaves, and when she is out the doors my manager calmly proceeds to void the return she just processed for this lady. She then got on the phone with our district manager and told him the story.

Apparently, this isn't the first time she tries this with us. The lady never got back her money and she now has a red flag on her account permanently. Awesome.

SubzeroMK,64,,98,1ihgwm,,409,"So I used to be a General Manager for a quick lube joint in Northern Virginia. 

I will exclude certain names with ~~.

It was a typical Sunday morning, rather slow when a SUV pulls around. My crew was already working on a car so I walked over and did the usual, ""Welcome to ~quick lube~, my name is SuchNSuch, are you here for our ~main service~""

He looked at me with a fire in his eye and said, ""just pull my damned car in, change the ~FLIPPITIDO~ oil and let me go!"" So I did the usual as calm as I could, ""alrighty sir! Just gonna have you release your hood latch for me and ill escort you to our waiting room"" with a giant smile on my face as he says, ""why the ~FLAMBOOZLE~ do I have to open my hood?! That's your job!"" So I explain to him, ""well as a liability reason we ask all customers to release the hood latch so that if it becomes damaged we are not responsible"" he mutters some words and complies.

I take him inside and show him around the waiting area, coffee, restroom and magazines located. He then turned to me as if he was ready to kill. 

He screamed, ""I WANT TO SEE A MANAGER NOW!!"" So I tell him I am the highest ranking member of the team as the General Manager and ask him what I can help him with.

He begins to say the following.
&gt;I brought my car here 4 months ago! I saw YOUR employee pulling a plug out of my rear differential and I guess he didnt put the ~FLAPPING~ plug back in because when I was driving 4 days later my rear differential was bone dry and locked up!! I had to spend three-THOUSAND dollars on a new one!!!&gt;

( Side note - I that business, if you have ever had service done at any location nationwide we can see it immediately on the computers, we can see what day, time, services done and everything. And this guy had never been to a location ever)

So I asked him to hold on a moment I would pull up some records, find out who was working the lower side on his vehicle and if he brought me in the receipt for the new differential I could have my Director of Administration cut him a check to reimburse him the cost. At this point he had this dumb look on his face like ""oh shit"".

Trying hard not to laugh at this point, I walked over to the computer and typed in his info and asked him if he changed any information because I couldn't find it in the system. 

He said, ""well look harder! You guys did it!""

So I typed some stuff in and nothing. I told him nothing was coming up, he became infuriated and started shaking in anger, trying to hold back my laughter I told him to wait a moment I would speak with some employees to see if they remember. Walked downstairs and had myself (along with the employees who were witnessing the events) a real good laugh. 

When I returned he screamed, ""you know what?! ~FLIP~ you! And ~FRIGG~ this place!! 

At this point his oil change had already been completed as he brought in his own stuff. He jumped in his car and bolted without paying.

I called my district manager and told him the story in all it's hilarity. He told me he would take care of the rest.

3 weeks later we got a visit from the local PD saying that he was actually going from place to place trying to get money for his ""busted differential"" and stealing services from quick lubes. He was arrested and case closed.

silentsecrets,194,,102,165j2v,,404,"An older gentleman came through my line and as I was ringing up his items, I did my usual routine of a few quick questions.  His name will be Cranky.

Me (ringing items up):  Do you have a (insert store name) card?

Cranky: No, I don’t have one.

Me (beginning to bag his items):  Would you like to sign up for our free rewards system?

Cranky: No, I don’t want to.

Me:  Okay, your total comes to twelve fifty.

Cranky (staring at me):  Are you done with all the harassment yet?

Me (surprised):  Excuse me?

Cranky:  I bet you don’t see it that way, do you?  You stand there and ask all these stupid questions.  I just want to pay and leave.

Me:  No, I don’t view it as harassment.  I view it as being part of my job.  I’m required to ask all customers if they have a card and if they don’t, I am supposed to ask if they want one.

Cranky (still not showing that he intends to pay for his items that have been bagged since before I even told him the total):  Well, it’s a waste of time.  I don’t like to be harassed when I go to the store.  I just want to buy my things and go.

Me: Okay, well, your total is twelve fifty.

Cranky:  That’s more like it.  I don’t want to stand here and answer a thousand questions.  I am tired of people asking me if I want a store card.  I just want to buy my items and leave.

Me:  Okay.

Cranky:  How much did you say it was?

Me (slightly more enunciated this time):  Your total was twelve fifty.

Cranky: There we go.

He finally got out a twenty dollar bill to pay with and tosses it on the far side of the counter behind his bags, you know, as far away from me as possible.

Cranky:  What did you say the change was?

Me (slightly exasperated at this point, fighting to keep it out of my voice): Fifty cents.

Cranky (digging out dimes, pennies, and pocket lint that he drops on the counter):  You get it.

This annoys me further, but I pick up his coins because I just want him to leave. I finally complete the transaction and think I am going to be free from his presence when I give Cranky his change and put the receipt in his bag.

Instead, he continues to stand at my register and give me a lecture about how people just want to buy their products and leave.  He says they don’t want to be interrogated as they are paying and he thinks it’s ridiculous that all these cashiers are always harassing people asking about cards everywhere he goes.  He says that he says no every time and for some reason we can never just remember that he doesn’t want one.

This is the thing about people like Cranky.  They don’t want to just pay and leave.  They want to give people like me a hard time.  It is part of my job to ask about cards and if they want them.  All they have to do is say no.  I work it into the process of ringing them up and I don’t make them wait any extra time.  He wasted more of his own time than I did.  If you just want to buy your items and leave, then shut up and do it.  It is not difficult.

IronyJudge,152,,85,1q2sps,,407,"Hi ya'll. I've been reading this subreddit since I got my retail job, but haven't posted anything because I don't want anything on my main account being traced back to me. My boss is on reddit, so I'll be posting with this one. 

I work at one of your standard big-box corporate pet stores. My general function is the ""know everything about everything in the store"" guy. If you have a question about dog food, they call me. If you have a question about birds, they call me. If you have a question about which sort of cat litter is the best for getting out of 6 inches of mid-November Minnesota snow, they call me. I will also give you the long answer to any question you ask. If you make a statement in conflict with proper animal care protocol I will gently explain why you are wrong and how you can be less wrong. As you will see, I tend to be very long winded.

Aquatic turtles are really popular when people are asking about them, and are the slowest selling animal in the store. A proper set up on them will easily run into $400. They need massive aquariums ($115 not on sale), and all of the fitting aquarium accessories. If anybody asks me about turtles I will go through the costs with them.

Then come in three women. One of them quickly designates themselves as the primary customer.

Turtle Lady: ""I want one of 'em turtles.""  
Me: ""Alright. Do you have a tank?""  
TL: ""No.""  
Me: ""Well, You'll have to get a tank first and set it up. Normally I recommend a 40 Breeder""  
TL: ""I want this one"" *points at 10 gallon tank*  
Me: ""These guys get pretty big. You'll need to upgrade to a bigger tank in a matter of months. It's cheaper to get the fill grown tank and just start from there.""   
TL: ""I'm getting this tank. Just get me the fucking turtle."" *holds 10 gallon*

Corporate tends to want us to bend over backwards and lick the shoes of customers, though I am more than willing to politely tell a customer to shove it. 

Me: ""You can not put that turtle in a 10 gallon tank.""  
TL: ""Well, it's only to get to Chicago. Then I'll get everything. Actually just get me everything I need and I'll buy the tank when I get there""

This is where things start to get weird. I head off and grab a shopping cart and start to piece everything one would need for a proper turtle setup. Out of spite I threw together the most expensive possible set-up. Top of the line heater, top of the line lamps, biggest possible resting spot, fanciest filter. $50 bag of pelleted food. 

I finally bring the cart over to her and she flips her shit. Unbeknownst to me while I was filling the cart she paid for the turtle and the 10 gallon tank. The turtle was legally hers, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. You can't really force a customer to return something against their will. 

TL: ""WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS?""  
Me: ""You asked me to get everything you'd need for the turtle.""  
TL: ""The fuck is this for?"" *holds up lamp fixture*  
Me: ""It's a basking lamp. It helps them absorb calcium.""  
TL: ""Fuck all this shit. I'm just getting this tank and the fucking turtle.""

I just want the lady out of the store at this point. 

TL: ""I'm going to get this tank, put the turtle in it, and when I get home to Chicago I'll get all the stuff I need.""  
Me: ""Let me write you a list of things you need.""

I write the list, and decide to take the 'Yeah, we're all buddies here' tone with her from then out.

TL: ""You're going to fill up the tank, then we'll put it in my car.""  

*you can't be fucking serious*. You are going to take an aquarium, set it in the back of your car, and drive it 400 miles from Minneapolis to Chicago, sloshing around the entire time. *Be my fucking guest.*

Me: ""Uh, okay. How are we going to get it in the car?""  
TL: ""The fuck you mean? I'm going to carry it.""  
Me: ""A filled 10 gallon tank weighs around 90 pounds.""  

For a turtle you only fill it halfway, but I just felt like fucking with her at this point.

TL: ""Yeah, I'll lift it in.""  
Me: ""Sure, I'll put it on a cart and fill it for you.""  
TL: ""You think I'm fucking weak! I'm going to carry it!""  
Me: ""Well, it'd be easier.""  
TL: ""I'm fucking carrying it!""

I just resign myself to facilitating her insanity at this point. Nothing I can do, just get her the fuck out of the store as fast as possible. I fill up the tank, let her carry it all the way out (including when she forgot her keys inside the store and walked all the way back in holding the 90 pound sloshing tank. When she finally got back outside she opened the door to the $45,000 car, set it on her back seat and buckled it in.

The other two ladies make their way to the car, having not witnessed the rest of the interaction, and start screaming at Turtle Lady about how insane it was she would have an open aquarium sitting in the back of her car. I sort of slink away back into the store and start telling my coworkers about what had transpired.

Then she comes in holding the tank, turtle in it, and comes up to me. 

TL: ""So we've decided we need a smaller tank.""  
Me: ""Well, the one you had was probably the cheapest one.""  
TL: ""I don't care about the price.""  
Me: ""Well... uh, I mean, we have a 2.5 gallon fish bowl, but you would need to get a new tank for him the instant you get to Chicago. It's one of our larger markets, so you'll have no problem finding a store.""  
TL: ""Yeah yeah, whatever."" 

She returns the 10 gallon, leaving me to deal with a half full aquarium and purchases the fish bowl and some food for the turtle. It's about then I'm sent to get dinner for everybody working in the store, which I'm usually more than glad to do. As I'm getting in my car I see her walk back into the store with the fish bowl. Not my fucking problem at this point.

When I get back in I find that she wanted a bigger thing for the turtle. She also spent a fair amount of time bugging the cashier about what ethnicity she is (mixed, 1/2 black 1/2 white, apparently black girls can't have hair as pretty as hers?)

Turtle Lady finally left, and we all held a vigil for the turtle. At least somebody made a point of writing ""NO GUARANTEE"" on the turtle's paperwork.

Inceptagon,93,,104,1h8p1r,,403,"At my restaurant, we recently added a ""taco salad"" to the menu. Thing is, this ""taco salad"" is not served with an edible shell like most restaurants serve them. It's just the salad part. I thought that was kind of an odd move, but whatever. I just work here.

(For some people that might give away where I work, but I don't care; it's necessary for the story.)

A few weeks ago, I got a lady who came in huffing, demanding a replacement order for an order we messed up. She correctly names a manager she talked with on the phone, and she has the receipt. Okay, so I honor it. 

I look at the receipt and see that she had ordered a taco salad and nothing else. I say to her, ""Ma'am, just out of curiosity, what was the matter with the taco salad? I just want to double check that we don't make the same mistake twice.""

She says, ""They didn't give me a taco salad. I don't know what I got, but it wasn't a taco salad.""

Immediately, I start thinking, *Oh god, this better not be going where I think it's going...*

So I dutifully remake it, exactly to specifications, and I give it to her and apologize about whatever the problem was. Internally, I'm crossing my fingers that the lady would accept it. She doesn't.

""What is this?! This isn't a taco salad.""

I cringe and say, ""Ma'am, that's our taco salad. That's exactly how we make them.""

She says, ""No, it's not a taco salad. Taco salads have shells.""

I try to say, ""Ma'am, the salad has seasoned taco beef on it, and crunchy tortilla strips on top.""

She says, ""No, I ordered a taco salad, you need to make me a taco salad. I want one with a shell.""

I apologize and say, ""We can't make taco shells. This company doesn't stock the tortillas we need to make them.""

Her face turns red, and she starts rambling, ""That's false advertizing! Why do you advertize a taco salad if it doesn't have a shell? Taco salads have shells, that's what makes them taco salads! Without the shell, it's not a taco salad!""

In one last attempt to be polite, I pull out a menu for her and point out the picture clearly labeled ""TACO SALAD,"" showing that it doesn't, in fact, come with an edible shell, but a bowl. It looks exactly like the one I made for her. I show her that it's exactly how we advertize it.

She says, ""This has to be a misprint. That can't be right.""

I say, ""What do you mean?""

She says, like a broken record, ""This picture isn't a taco salad. It doesn't have a shell.""

At this point, internally, I'm screaming ""GO TO (Popular Mexican Restaurant), you crazy woman!"" but on the outside, I restrain myself. Instead, I say, ""Ma'am, I'm very sorry for the confusion, but that is actually the way we serve our taco salads. If you would like something else from our menu, I'd be happy to make it for you.""

She says, ""So you can't make me a taco salad? Is that what you're saying?""

I get the manager and walk away because I'm fuming at her. Manager says something to her and makes her leave. Later, we get a corporate complaint, presumably from her, that a customer got a taco salad made ""incorrectly"" without an edible shell, and that we were rude and refused to make it ""correctly,"" which puts a negative mark on our store's score. But whatever; if that's the price for never seeing her again, then so be it.

Some of these people... they give me funny stories to tell friends, that's for sure. I just need to keep telling myself that, and maybe I won't end up pulling my hair out.

jadefirefly,35,,47,19r2n6,,408,"I work in one of those discount stores - not exactly a dollar store, though we do have lots of $1 items, but stuff that isn't is still really cheap. It's also a fairly low-income town. So needless to say, my clientele doesn't always represent the cream of the crop. 

Tonight I had an older man at my register, and he didn't move about very well. His cane was in the shopping cart, and it was obvious that he wasn't going to get very far without support. He didn't have a whole lot of stuff, but it still wound up being two bags worth. 

Now he'd planned to cart it all to his car and return the cart, like any reasonable person would do -- but we've got such a theft problem, carts included, that the carts all have poles on them that prevent them from being taken out the door. (There's normally a couple that don't, in case someone *really* needs one, but... they're missing. Again.) 

Right behind him was a kid, somewhere in the 10-13 range. He'd obviously been sent on an errand; all he had was two boxes of tissues. Not to be judgemental, but honestly he looked like the kind of kid I might have to watch in the store in a couple of years. Saggy pants, lopsided ball cap, oversized hoodie. 

As I'm scanning his tissues through, I explain to the old man that I can help him with his bags in just a moment, as soon as I've finished with the kid. And before anyone else can say anything, the kid steps up and says, ""I can get your bags for you, sir."" 

Sure as anything, he gathers up that guy's bags, waits for him to get his cane all situated, and walks him right out to his car. 

I *know* something like that shouldn't move me that much. But it's just so damn rare around here to see kids display any real initiative to help others that my manager and I just stood there as they left, shocked. It made my day. ",Faith in adolescents - temporarily restored!,455,talesFromRetail
BAWWWWful,141,,82,17ixnu,,403,"Today I present you with a familiar retail tale, you know the type. Corporate sets a policy, management communicates that policy to the sales associate, sales associate attempts to enforce policy, spineless manager bends policy to avoid confrontation. It makes you wonder why policies exist in the first place. This tale is not as gross or shocking as some of the other stories about returns, but it is one of the more memorable from my experience. 


This occurred circa 2009 when I worked in the Men's department of [crappy department store]. Our store's return policy was more than fair if you ask me. Most merchandise, except for electronics, could be returned with a receipt and we would return the amount paid for the item in the form that it was given. If you had the receipt, you could return merchandise in virtually any condition, there were very few limitations on this. If you had no receipt, we could return the item for store credit so long as the SKU came up in our system and the item wasn't visibly worn. We even accepted merchandise with no tags, as long as it was something we currently carried and therefore could obtain a SKU and process the return. Exchanges were allowed as long as the item was of equal value, preferably the same brand and style. You get the idea. Often when customers found out that they could only get store credit without a receipt, they would opt for an exchange. 


One day, a middle-aged man approaches the register brandishing a visibly used Fossil belt with no tags. I shall call him **Belt Guy**. Belt Guy asks if he can return the belt. It's me and two other employees working that day, **Michelle**^not ^her ^name and **Lindsay**^same ^deal. 

*Foreshadowing: Michelle in particular is known for not taking shit from anyone, and for regularly complaining that management makes the sales associates look bad by not backing them up on policy issues.* 

At that moment, Michelle was elsewhere in the department straightening merchandise. Lindsay and I were talking with Belt Guy at the register, we explained the policy and stated that a belt in that condition was not returnable without a receipt. Given that it was a Fossil belt, we didn't even know whether he bought it from us to begin with. We directed Belt Guy to the corner of the department where the belts and wallets lived so that he could buy himself a new friend. 


Belt Guy returns about 10-15 minutes later carrying a brand new Fossil belt with tags. If memory servers, it wasn't even the same belt as the one he was attempting to exchange. As he casually passes by the counter, the following dialogue ensues.


**Belt Guy**: I put the other belt on the rack and I exchanged it for this one, OK?


I'll pause the dialogue for a moment so we can all take that in. This customer thought it was totally normal to ~~exchange~~ take new merchandise without presenting his original merchandise, and that he could just walk right out with it. OK, *resume play*.


*(He starts towards the door.)*

**Me**: *(flabbergasted)* What?

**Lindsay**: Sir, you can't do that.

**Belt Guy**: *(looking perplexed)* What?

**Lindsay**: We would have to actually process the exchange at the register, we need a record of the transaction in our system. 

**Belt Guy**: But someone said I could!

*Lindsay and I exchange looks, knowing none of us would tell a customer they could do such a thing.*

**Me**: Who?

**Belt Guy**: It was a lady... she had brown hair.

Note: the description he gave seemed intentionally vague, and the only one of us who could be described that way would be Michelle. We knew she wouldn't approve something like that.


It was pretty clear to us what was going on here. This guy knew he wasn't going to get his return through the proper channels because he had probably worn his old belt for years and knew we couldn't turn around and sell it to someone else.


Fortunately, Michelle was just coming back to the register at that point, perhaps seeing the commotion. 

**Belt Guy**: You! *(points at Michelle)* You said I could just leave the other belt on the rack and take this one!

**Michelle**: *WHAT?* No I didn't. 

**Belt Guy**: Yes you did! I want to talk to a manager!


You can imagine our joy^facetiousness upon hearing those awful words. At [crappy department store], the procedure is to call customer service and request that a manager come to the department. Whichever manager is available will head over. So, one of us makes the call while Michelle, understandably, continues arguing with the customer. I would be angry too, being accused of something that I know I didn't and would not ever do.


We quietly groan among ourselves when we see who we won playing the manager lottery. It's **Nancy**^still ^with ^the ^made-up ^names! . Nancy isn't your run-of-the-mill spineless manager. Oh no, Nancy was much worse than that. She had no business being in a management position. She was the epitome of non-contfrontationalism, a complete doormat. Don't get me wrong, she seemed like a nice enough lady and all, but why take on a position of authority if you're incapable of telling people what to do?


Nancy strolls up to the register, already looking meek upon seeing all the commotion. Michelle argues her case, the customer argues his, Lindsay and I chime in with bits of policy, particularly underlining the reasonable notion that when you exchange merchandise, you should ACTUALLY GIVE US THE MERCHANDISE. This back and forth goes on for a while, Nancy nervously glancing between the four of us, until she just can't take it anymore. She throws her arms up in consternation:


**Nancy**: Oh, just let him take the belt!


And that was it. She walks away. The three of us are wearing our best *are you fucking kidding me?* faces, and the customer gleefully strides out of the store. 


That's right. The fucker got away with it. I don't remember if that was the last straw, the one that broke my morale, but I do know that not long after that the job became nothing but a paycheck to me. I started to just cut out the damn middle man, give the customers whatever they wanted, and deal with the repercussions. Spoiler alert: there never were any.

HeloRising,41,,74,1qvprn,,404,"This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you. The last one took off so I figured I'd throw another one up.

***

I was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door. This wasn't strictly unusual, sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends. These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear, though, and all whiter than bleached snow. A little odd but this was in an *incredibly* white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall, it wasn't unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given day.

So 3Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces (a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes). I greeted them but they didn't take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes later.

""Yo...Yo man...you got like any frogs?"" 

""Frogs? Yeah we've got a couple of different ones, they should be up on that shelf"" 

""Naw dawg, I saw those ones. But I'm lookin' for somethin' special. Somethin' *gangsta*.""

I stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a ""gangsta"" frog looked like. I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker, thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the new(ish) guy. She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for *reals*, yo.

I told him to hold on and I'd check in the back. I went back where another employee was finishing up glazing.

""Hey...I don't know our whole stock yet. Do we have anything back here that we don't have out there?"" 

""A couple of things, why what'd they ask for?""

-long pause- ""A gangsta' frog.""

""....the fuck is a ""gangsta' frog?""

""I have no idea. Do we have anything that meets that criteria?""

""We've got one with a big chain, give him that.""

We did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to him.

""Yeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii! That's what I'm *talkin'* 'bout! 'Dat's the *shit* right there!""

So he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery. His cohorts also selected figurines, Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose. From listening to their back-and-forth, these were suitably gangsta' choices for various reasons.

As they were painting, my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song (they had, in fact, begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working with).

They took about an hour to finish their pieces. I wouldn't have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously. We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on *at length*, though I'm not positive how a springing lion can look ""straight outta Compton.""

Once they finished, they paid with credit cards (not as gangsta as a wad of cash but *way* easier for me to deal with) and left. Last I heard, they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap. To their credit, they weren't half bad at it.

Antics aside, they were actually very nice and never gave us any static. Never even heard the ""n"" word out of them (which was sadly very common with the hip-hop kids, especially the white kids).",They want gangsta' frogs.,478,talesFromRetail

tetewhyelle,71,,118,18pc5k,,399,"Okay so Valentines Day was a really long day for me. In fact, it was the first time I'd ever worked more than 9hrs in a day. So expect this post to be long. I'm warning you now. It's going to be a read.

I work in Make-A-Monkey, Create-A-Cat, Build-A-Bulldog, etc. You get the idea. As usual, I will preface this by saying I LOVE my job. Love, love, love my job. Anyways, on to my lovely Valentine's Day. 

It was busy. The day before that, I'd prepared to be called in early. My original shift had been 4-close. (store closed at 9, usually finish cleaning around 9:30) However, my ASM woke me up at around 10:30 and asked me to come in early. No biggie. In fact, that awesome. More hours and more money for me. 

When I got there, my ASM apoligized profusely for taking time away from Valentines(she knows I live with my bf) and thanks me for coming in. It really wasn't a huge deal though. My boyfriend and I had basically already decided that since we are so poor, there is no sense is celebrating a money-spending holiday like V-day. As he said, ""We don't need to spend scrupulous amounts of money on each other just to say 'I love you'."" 

So basically, Thursday is truck day. One manager usually stays in the back to unpack the boxes and put all the shit away. While 1-2 floor associates handle the floor. Since it was going to be a busy day, they had a floor associate and my GM working the floor while my ASM did truck. The problem soon arose when they realized a newbie had been the scheduled floor associate. So my GM was having to try to work on the new floor sets, work register, answer questions for guests, *and* help put away any of the new stock that was supposed to go on the floor. The problem had become worse when they realized that out of the remaining three people to come in, I was the only one who wasn't a new hire...somebody really screwed the schedule up.

I ended up getting put in the hole to unload the boxes and put them either on the floor or top stock. Which took a good 2hrs. The whole time I was in the backroom, I could hear it getting progressively busier but I did not expect to see what I saw when I went back on the floor. It was literally worse than Christmas. The store was trashed, there was a line out the door and down the hallway, and there was a steady crowd forming in front of register. 

I hopped on register for a few hours until we go to a slow point then made a stock list. I was about halfway done pulling everything when my manager(I think I called her Kate in another story) who had just took over floor after the ASM and GM left, came to the back to tell me she needed me on the floor. The store was swamped again and remained that way steadily until around 8:30. It didn't really slow down, it just got to a point where nobody was waiting the be rung up and I could talk to my manager, Kate, for a second. We had to send one of the new girls home because she had stayed 30min past her shift and we had to leave the other one on the stuff machine because that's all she had been trained on so far. 

Kate and I made a game plan basically. She told me what we needed to get done before the end of the night, so I made myself, Kate, and the new girl all a to-do list. I felt bad for the new girl because she got all the shitty cleaning jobs but she was too inexperienced to know how to stock, reset the floor set, and box away the Vday stuff. Tonight was definitely not the night to teach her either. I got the lists handed out and then put the gate halfway down to discourage any more customers from coming in the store. It was starting to slow down around 8:45. The lines were going down, but it was 15 until close and we still hadn't even finished the midday stock, started a close stock list, or began to put out the new floor sets. 

7 minutes until close about 10 families ducked under the gate and started browsing. I let everyone know the store was closing in 7minutes and got complaints from everyone that, ""Well we thought you had later closing hours on Valentine's Day. You really ought to. It's almost offensive that you don't."" 

Like what the fuck? Okay, don't wait until 8:50 at night to go shopping. Dafuq people?! Then this one family. They topped it all. They'd driven over an hour to our store because the one closer to them was closed for renovations. That store sent out mailers and handed out flyers for MONTHS letting people know to come to our store instead and still people call us all like, ""OH MY GOD! You're actually open?! Oh thank GOD!"" Like every single one of our stores closed for renovations at the same.

Anyways, back to this family. They'd driven over an hour. The wife was hearing impaired and talked in a way that made it very hard to understand. Her husband had a thick African accent and they often switched between speaking English and their native language...which did not help for communication. Their kid/grandkid(not sure which) obviously did not even want to make a bear. It was like they were talking him into it essentially. Like for example, I overheard this convo while they were looking at clothes.

Dad/grandad : Hey didya see this outfit? It's really cool.

Kid/grandkid: Yeah, it's alright.

dad/grandad: Well let's get it then.

Kid: I don't know

Dad: well you said it was cool so why not get it? Oh my God, we are just getting this.

Kid: Fine...I didn't even want to come here anyways.


So they're making their frustrating way to register and then mom/grandma suddenly remembers she must make three more stuffed animals for her daughters/grandaughters. But it can't just be any one stuffed animal. Oh no, she has to ask extensive questions about every single one of them. Like which ones were most popular. I tell her why. And she's like ""No, those are ugly. Why would a girl want that?"" I wanted to scream at her ""I DON'T KNOW. YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS POPULAR AND I TOLD YOU!"" But, of course, I was polite and asked if there were any colors or animals the girls were interested in.

She finally decides on our V-day themed animal. Fine. We make three of them. Then she needs three matching V-day themed outfits. Well our stock has dwindled and we only have a few things left. She doesn't like what we have left and proceeds to spend another 20 minutes looking. At this point, they were the last people in the store and it is now 30 minutes after close. 

I tell the new girl to start on her checklist because it was just cleaning stuff that could be done whether a customer was in the store or not. She starts on that. They finally get up the counter and I start to ring them up. Of course, she has to complain about pricing and ask the price of everything even though it tells her on our penpad. Then she decides to remove something so I void the item from the transaction but it's still telling her it's there on the penpad. She doesn't understand that it's not a live update and doesn't refresh right away.

She has some coupons so I apply those and some point reward certificates. Now. These things basically count as cash. They're usually like $10 and they run as a tender. Like a $10 check from corporate to you. So once I run it through, there's no going back. Even if I void the transaction, it'll take a call to corporate to get the certificate back. So naturally, what do you think she does? Oh well she decides she does in fact want that item I voided and not just one but like an odd number like 9 or something. Whatever. I tell her it'll have to be a seperate transaction. She doesn't flip her shit or anything but she's obviously pissed and not having any of it. Complaining and alike.

Finally, got her and her family out of the store at....(drumroll please).... 9:50!!! 50 minutes after close. So Kate starts closing out the registers because she couldn't do it while the family was there. I start pulling the V-day stuff to the back. Since Kate was opening the next day, she said she would box it up if I could just put out the new floor sets. So I started on that. Which took a good 30 minutes. Then we realize we are missing some of our displays, so I start on that.

Oh and the POS system pretty much crashed so Kate was on the phone with our DM for a while trying to sort that out. Then she had to send our V-day numbers and other promotional offer info to the RM and all that other manager-y stuff. The new girl kept cleaning and straightening...at a slow pace. At around 10:45 I started making a stock list(FINALLY!!) I made seperate lists and took them to the back so Kate could pull them. We got everything re-stocked decently. Not perfect but at this point we were way past caring. Sent the new girl home. Finished  the new girls cleaning list and finally clocked out at 11:30. I worked a 10.5 hour shift that day. Damn was I tired. 

I then proceeded to work an 8hr shift the day after V-day and a another 10.5hr shift yesterday. So in three days I racked up essentially 30hrs. 

The pros - my store manager is asking the DM for the go ahead to give me manager training

The cons - I lost my voice from talking to customers so much.

I carded her LIKE I HAVE TO WITH EVERY GODDAMN YOUNG PERSON WHO COMES TO MY REGISTER but she not only refused, but she got downright nasty. Who am I to card her, she works at the store over in [nearby town name removed], and demands to talk to one of our shift supervisors, who I'll call A. A comes up, rings her up on his register because he knows her so I'm in the clear if anyone from the department of health decided to be in the testing our store that day.

A little ways, the nasty bitch came back trying to return an item without a receipt. As is company policy, I asked for her ID, and the exchange went like this.

N.B.: This is ridiculous, I work for [Company from Hell]!

Me: Then you should know, that I can't take this item back without ID.

N.B.: WHERE IS A? GET HIM UP HERE!

Luckily, A was on shift that day so I was able to call him. Once again, I get out of having to do a questionable transaction. It's also very suspicious when an employee at one store tries to return something for store credit at another store, but still, as long as I'm not doing this return which doesn't have her ID number on it, I'm not going to worry about this coming down on me.

A short while after that, we had a visit from our L.P. manager, and who comes in but the nasty bitch, this time with her sister, and her kid, who was in a toddler and was kept in a stroller. They started stealing from us off the floor when the management team along with the L.P. caught them. The L.P. introduced himself to the nasty bitch and she spat back something to the effect of, ""Big guy huh? Where did you go to school for that."" The three of them were detained and the L.P. instructed one of the managers to call the police. Upon checking the camera, we found her putting product underneath the stroller and leaving the store and coming back in. The bitch was fucked, and to make it even sweeter, her savior, A wasn't even working that day.

I have 14 or 15 rooms on the third floor booked by a middle school basketball team for a tournament in town this weekend. The kids were done for the day, and were terrorizing the hotel with all of their leftover energy.

Aside from sprinting up and down the hallways/stairs, they were all congregating in the halls outside their room (a big no-no). I went to tell them, for the third time, to stay in their rooms- and suddenly a coach that had been sitting near them jumps up and gets in my face.

He starts screaming about how I shouldn't talk to his kids like that and that by disrespecting them, I was disrespecting him. He is all up in my face, and the other coaches have to calm him down while he demands a refund if we want him to leave. Note, I never asked him to leave, just to keep the kids quiet.

Ten minutes later, Mr. Sunshine comes down and I think (in a moment of misplaced optimism) that he is going to apologize. Nope. He says that they're going to leave and he needs a refund. One of the choice quotes s the title quotes. He honestly expected the guests that complained to find a different hotel because HIS children couldn't behave. I had the unfortunate duty of telling him that we need 24 hours notice to cancel a night, and that I'd have to charge them as the rooms were dirty and I couldn't rent them back out.

As this is going on, some of his kids come through and sprint up the stairs and down the hall. Even from the distance we were, it was incredibly loud. Once he heard it even from the front desk, I was able to explain why there were so many complaints. He was still pissed, but at them now instead of me.

Our manager had two or three stores that he took care of, so our store was generally left with just me in charge because the other stores were 'problem' stores and weren't doing as well. This is relatively important, since he makes an appearance later on.

It's a typical Friday night and we're slammed. I'd already been there for 8 hours that day, I'm stuck on cash when I have so many other things to do, and I'm just generally hating my life. I was an expert at putting a smile on my face though and I never let my mood dictate how I treated a customer. I wanted them in and out of the store as quickly and smoothly as possible. 

It was going alright until this effing woman came up to my line. This woman who, years later, I still resent for treating me the way she did.

She comes up to my cash register (with about 6-8 people behind her) and slams a movie down on the counter. It's some bullshit romantic comedy with Sarah Jessica Parker in it. The conversation starts off as hostile right off the bat.

**Her:** I rented this an hour ago, get home, and my husband says he already rented it.

**Me:** That's no problem - if you'd like to go exchange it for something else, you can go ahead and do that. Otherwise we can just put a credit on your account for another movie the next time you're in. Up to you!

**Her:** I don't want another movie, I don't want a credit, I want an explanation as to how you'd let something like this happen.

**Me:** Okay. It is a bit weird that we didn't see that the movie was already rented out on the account, what's the phone number?

----

She gives me her phone number and two names pop up. It's obvious that her husband has a separate account from hers, so when she went to rent this movie, we didn't see anything because it's on a different account.

I explain this to her and she loses her damn mind.

**Her:** Well, you need to combine those accounts, but this is bullshit. How can you not see it was rented already?!

**Me:** Because there are two accounts. When you went to rent this, there was no way of knowing that there was another account in your household and what was rented on it. You used your card which linked directly to your account, not the phone number which shows two names: yours and your husband's.

**Her:** Well that's a stupid system and I need you to combine them.

**Me:** Can't combine them, but what I can do is delete yours and then just add you to your husband's so you'll be using the same account rather than two separate accounts.

**Her:** NO. I want them separate but together.

...

**Me:** That's not possible. If they're separate, then they're separate. There's nothing I can do to combine accounts. I already gave you the solution to the problem.

----

At this point, my manager comes in. He sees we're slammed and gets on the cash register beside me while I'm having this argument with this woman. 

**Her:** Stop telling me what you CAN'T do, and tell me you're going to do what I'm asking of you. Keep my separate accounts, but combine the two so this doesn't happen again.

----

**Me:** I can't do that. It doesn't make sense. I can't combine two things but keep them separate. Either keep the accounts the way they are, or you can delete yours and get on your husband's.

**Her:** If you say something about combining separate things one more time... I'm not an idiot!

----

I sigh and look over to my manager who's overheard the last part of this discussion. I am silently pleading for him to intervene and say something. Anything. Whatever has to happen to get this bitch out of my line and out the door. It's gone on for too long, the lineup's getting worse, I'm losing my patience.

He finally steps in and I breathe a sigh of relief. I step to the side while he takes over my computer. He lies to her, tells her the accounts will be combined but separate, and gives her THREE. FREE. MOVIES for the trouble she's experienced in our store this evening.

I am seething. I don't even know what to do. This chick gives me this smug look of satisfaction and I almost lose it.

**Her:** I knew it was possible, some people just don't want to do the work. 

----

In disbelief, I walk away before I say something I'll regret. I go to the backroom for some peace and quiet, pacing while I try to evaluate what just effing happened.

My manager comes walking into the backroom, telling me he never wants to see me treat a customer that way again and that it's never worthwhile to argue with them. Give them what they want, EVEN IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE, and move on.

This woman continued to come in, and I had to honor every one of her stupid free movies. She made a point to come to me, even when other cashes were open, and give me the same self-congratulatory attitude. 

Customers and shitty managers suck.

ElderTheElder,63,,77,1hfr7z,,401,"This story comes not from me, but from a friend who worked at a deli in Brooklyn for a few years in high school, and to this day remains one of my favorite instances of an asshole customer getting put in his place.

Backstory: The grill at the deli is turned off at a certain time every day. The deli remains open for another hour or so, but the grill is off early because it takes awhile to clean. Friend just finished cleaning the grill when he gets a phone call:

Customer: Yeah I'd like a grilled cheese delivered to [Vet office directly across the street from the deli].

Friend: Ah, sorry but the grill is closed. If you'd like, though, I make a pretty good version of a grilled cheese sandwich using the microwave, first I [explains what he does to the sandwich to make it delicious].

Customer: Yeah yeah whatever. Send me that.

*Microwaved grilled cheese is delivered across the street, cut to 5 minutes later. Enter Customer*

Customer, to friend: What the fuck is this? (holds up sandwich)

Friend: That would be the sandwich that you ordered. A grilled cheese...

Customer: This isn't a grilled cheese. This tastes like shit. You didn't even grill it.

Friend: I explained to you that the grill was off, and that if you wanted I would make it in the microwave. I make these all the time and I know that it doesn't taste like shit.

Customer: Well fuck you blah blah blah

*I should note here that, though I can't speak for the quality of the sandwich as I was not there, my friend is very competent and resourceful with food preparation. I've never had something of his that wasn't delicious.*

*Friend's boss overhears, comes in from the back room. Overheard the initial phone call so knows that the customer was aware the grill went off and had to have his grilled cheese made in the microwave.*

Boss: What's the problem here?

Customer: This guy [points to friend] made me this disgusting fucking sandwich in the microwave. (More complaining).

Boss: Let me see this sandwich. (Takes it from the customer, opens it up, revealing the gooey cheese. Takes a huge bite, then, with his mouth full...) This is fucking DELICIOUS. 

**Boss throws the grilled cheese halves at the customer, one of them sticks to his shirt**

Boss: Now get the fuck out of here. Don't come back.

This story hales from early in my time at the station.  This was around the spring of 2007, when gas prices were at all-time highs, the economy was in all-time lows, the war was at an all-time crap-fest, and everyone in general was feeling an all-time slump.  People weren't happy with their lots in life.  Where once people would ask to ""fill 'er up,"" we were now getting small and odd denomination requests, as it was obvious people were scraping the bottoms of their change jars just to afford to get to work.  In short, things weren't that great.  As Dickens said, the worst of times.

I had not yet been trained to be a cashier, so my duties consisted only of being an attendant, plus coming inside occasionally to help stock shelves or futz about in the cooler.  Which is where I was when this particular little mini-drama unfolded.  A small truck pulled up, and the driver asked to fill his tank with premium.  NOT A CHEAP REQUEST.  At the time, premium was around $4.80/gal, and his truck had something like a 20 gallon tank that was just shy of empty.

But the alarming thing wasn't that the guy wanted to spend $95 on gas, it's that he was obviously methed out pretty hard.  His pupils were so large it looked like he had no iris, just twin wells of deep blackness.  He was sweating hard even though it wasn't that warm, he looked gaunt and thin, his cheeks sunken and sallow.  His movements were jerky and had a random aspect to them, like the neurons in his somatosensory cortex had all gone on strike and the scabs they had hired to replace them really didn't understand the muscle movement user interface (this should be a lesson, always hire union workers).

After he had told the attendant that he was going to pay inside and grabbed his slip, he proceeded to wander aimlessly up and down the aisles of our store, looking at everything but seeing nothing.  The cashier and the assistant manager soon became worried that this guy was going to splash-and-dash, and this is where I realized that the crew at this station would be good to go when things got rough.  Through very sneaky use of the intercom, whispered instructions, body language, and general intuitiveness, all three of the attendants, the cashier, the AM, the GM, and the three guys down at the car wash were all now surreptitiously watching this guy like a cast of hawks.  However, he was oblivious to our watchful eyes.  Instead he picked up three 2-liter bottles of Mt Dew, placed them on the counter, then blabbered semi-coherently about needing the bathroom.  The cashier pointed to the door near the back.

At this point the AM, the cashier, and I had a hurried discussion.  He was obviously out of his mind on something very strong, he shouldn't be driving.  Could we figure out a way to hold the guy there long enough for the cops to show up?  The AM went into the back room to call it in, while I stood watch.

That last question, thankfully, answered itself.  The guy came back out, still dazed and confused, but now walked straight past the counter and headed outside.  I yelped into the backroom, ""I think he's going to try and drive off!"" as the AM was still talking with the dispatcher.  His tone became more urgent as he now described the fact that this guy was about to make off with $100 worth of gas.  Haste by the responding officers was promised.

But Lo!!  The gas station gods did smile upon us that day, for it is written that this man could not get his truck started, and he was wroth before their eyes.  I don't know what it was that was wrong with his truck, but he could not get it to start.  The attendant came over and asked for the slip showing that he had paid, but the driver just looked at him like he was a talking ficus or something, and went back to trying to start the truck.  The attendant then called inside on the intercom to ask if the guy had paid, and get the conversation on the microphone.  Nope, no money had been received.

The truck finally started, but all the guy did was back up and park alongside the store.  He sat in his car, fiddling with something in the front seat, as the rest of us waited with baited breath for the police to arrive.

With their usually alacrity, two units converged on our station with a timed precision that belied anything other than telepathy.  They contacted the driver, who seemed to be willing to go along with the program.  That is, until one of the cops reached out for him, and, like Usain Bolt coming off the blocks during the 100-meter finals at the London 2012 Olympics, he was off like a shot.

A short foot chase ensued.  I'm sure that if this man had not ingested some sort of heavy narcotic, he probably could have gotten away, because he was quite fast.  However, being fast means nothing when you don't have good balance or coordination, because he tripped and fell over himself about the time he got to the far end of the parking lot, followed quickly by flying tackles that would make any Heisman winner proud.

Cuffed and secured, he was lead back up to the station to be patted down.  And what would you know, he had ZERO money on him.  No cards, no cash, no checks, no *nuthin'*.  So the officers charged him with theft and evasion, and got him in one of their cars.  They then searched his truck, finding several small baggies of an oddly-familiar white substance.  Well then, add possession of meth to the list (got to watch them do the test on the material, it's very cool and incredibly fast).  The officers thanked us, we high-fived our selves several times, and then went back to work, secure in the knowledge that we had each other's backs and that at least one bad guy was off the streets.

**POST SCRIPT:**  The tale does not end there, but continues on a few days and about 100 miles later.  The guy made bail, hitched a ride, and was found south of the state capitol at a rest stop, naked as Helen Mirren in Caligula (but no where near as hot), doing his level best to murder a park bench with a wooden stake.  He was again arrested, but not before AGAIN getting in a foot pursuit, this time along the shoulder of the interstate.  I would love to have seen the faces of passing motorists as they saw a naked guy with a large chunk of wood being chased by several cops up the shoulder of a freeway in the rain.

ZshadeZ,18,,83,1nbnrm,,402,"I've recently switched careers back to a retail setting. My local district consists of a dozen stores separated by hundreds of miles from any other districts.  The district is in bad shape, as in bad to the point where the company has had to put a few million dollars into it to keep it going instead of it actually turning a profit.

At the moment I'm still in the middle of a 6-month training program, flying out regularly to train with management in a successful district. Yesterday when I was flying back home for a 5 day break from training I noticed my larger suitcase zipper had pulled away in a 3 inch strip. Luckily nothing came out on the flight back, since my laptop and portable hdd of entertaniment, work clothes, etc were all in this suitcase.

I went to one of our local district stores this morning to get a new suitcase (We carry nice ones, and employee discounts are nice). I know nothing of brands, but found a great 28"" suitcase.... with no tag. Only one of it's kind/brand I could find. This is a smaller company with a very dated sku/inventory system and without a barcode or another of an item to get the barcode from we can't look up the price or any information and it needs to be sent back to the RDC for investigation. Heh. Carried it with me and had an associate call out the SM and we chatted for a bit about the company and my training and the district and how he doesn't understand why they're losing so much money. I brought up the suitcase and hoped he'd be able to find another in the back, because I know per policy we can't sell items without an SKU and price.

He glanced at it and told the cashier ""We'll to $19.99 for it."" without looking in to it at all. I was annoyed, but a trainee can't really argue with a SM and I didn't want to make waves before even joining the district officially. Grabbed a few other things and checked out, and when I left I noticed the cashier had given me the employee discount on the $19.99 price, so I paid $14 for the suitcase.

Got home and looked it up... Kenneth Cole, higher end model, $300.00 retail.

Gee, guys, I have no idea why you're losing so much money selling things at roughly $170 under store cost.

geneticshift,19,,67,1avlyd,,398,"I work at a bookstore. I had a customer come in today looking for travel books. No problem, I take her over there. She's looking for guide to Barcelona. No problem, I show them to her. She finds one she likes, great! She then tells me she needs 35 by tomorrow, since she is in charge of a tour group that is going on vacation. Problem, for obvious reasons. She would probably need to go to at least 30 different stores, as we only carry 1-2 copies of specialty items like that at a time.

I explain that to her, and expect a blow up, as I usually do. She looks upset, and I brace myself. She then drops a bomb on me by saying/asking ""Well, that's too bad. What do you suggest instead?"" I think my jaw hit the floor. When I tell people no, they almost never ask for alternatives.

I told her that the title she liked, and a lot of other titles were available as e-books. If anyone was taking their phone, if they download the book, they can use it offline and not use any data. I told her other stores in the area might have more choices too. I told her I would suggest gift cards, because then her friends could buy the book she likes in a different store, buy a different book, or buy any book through our app and read it on their phone/tablet/ereader/what have you.

She had this amazing look of clarity on her face, basically shrieked in happiness at ""what an INCREDIBLE idea"" it was, and hugged me (I'm usually not ok with any kind of physical contact, for obvious reasons, but she was an adorable old lady, and I was still in shock).  I escorted  her to the front of the store, where she bought the book she was holding for herself, and 34 $15 gift cards. She also called my manager over and let her know that I was the ""best troubleshooter she ever met""

After a long and frustrating day, she was honestly a ray of sunshine that made up for it.

diinomunster,71,,108,1rcku1,,395,"Hello my lovelies. I had a wonderful 4p-8a shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas station/C-Store. (I'm a softy who just can't say no). This offense happened around 2am. 

Now my gas station is in a really dumb place. We're in the main Highway of our city which is why we're a 24/7 store, but we're in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I don't see much traffic between midnight and four am. That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us. (Somewhere because there's a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart, a pizza Hut, a burger restaurant, a funeral home [yeah idk either], and then the bar is somewhere in that mess). 

So anyway between 130 &amp; 230 I get a nice hour of drunks. Our local police force is always really nice. They know that it's either me (5'3"" 115lbs female) or J (scrawny, but seriously awesome, little white guy) working alone. I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic. The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store. (I seriously give these guys so much free coffee). 

The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had, fresh out of the Academy. Super nice guy. Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss (we get them fresh every day so they aren't dried out if they were bagged) and thanked them when they said they'd be keeping an eye out for me. Around 150ish they had nabbed a drunk driver (yay team!) and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street. 

Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout (I'm on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit). The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store. When you walk in there's the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right, coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall. You have to walk around to your right, following the counters, to leave through the exit door. This is so you can't sneak out behind us and steal something. 

Queue 2am. I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy who's browsing our snack food quietly. In comes this super drunk middle aged black male. He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall (it's about 4.5 feet high). He will be Drunk Guy (DG). 

DG: Hey! How much for a cab to Menomininity? (I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us). 

Me: I'm not sure. We can call a cab and ask. Do you have a certain cab company you like to use? 

DG: just look some numbers up for me on the Internet. 

Me: I don't have the Internet here. I have a phone book though you can borrow. 

Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for. 

DG: NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK! 

Yeah... Okay? He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms. On his way he took out the fruit stand, the magazine rack, and the little employee break table in the hallway. 

Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom. ""That black guy grabbed me by the jacket, pulled me out of the stall, then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me."" 

Uhh.. What? 

The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit (despite me telling him he didn't have to because I have to throw it all away anyway) insists he'll stay until this guy leaves. 

Me: Yeah I don't have the time for this. I'm just calling the police. 

I get on the phone with none emergency, explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in. Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer. 

DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic.. And then he sees the officer. 

DG: AW THE FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCH!

the officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didn't fight. I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense. College kid dipped out at some point (I think he was underaged). A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as I'm talking to RideAlong for my statement. Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole. His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar. 

Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at 130 like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks can't hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster. They also haven't been letting the drunk patrons use their phone. For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone. Yeah. Screw them. 

DG got hauled off, I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up. The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation. I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders. 

I thankfully had last night and tonight off so I'll see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better. 

Well it's bed time. Sorry for the sleepy rambling. Good night TFR.

MagneTismen,28,,86,1qlrym,,399,"A [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qktu7/chili_chili_everywhere/) reminded me of a story from my time when I was in the fast food business. Some of my earlier stories can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17zn7n/if_you_cant_pay_i_can/). It's been a while since I last posted, feels refreshing!

So I was working my 3rd (?) year in the fast food restaurant and was doing both cashier work and burger flipping. This particular Sunday was fairly easy-going and not too many customers coming in and out. Sundays usually meant slow business and thus, lots of cleaning/preparation for the coming week.

I was on the burger flipping side of the counter when I realised that we were about to run out of french fries so I did a quick check-up on what needed to be refilled and headed down to our storage room. This was the only time during the day that I was not in the vicinity of the counter/cashiers and was gone for roughly 5 minutes. When I come back up the three cashiers (new girls who had worked &lt;3 months) was standing scared shitless by the manager's office and one looked like she was about to cry. The following is a recap by one of the cashiers so I can't be 100% sure it went down like this but here's what happened:

A father (whom I had seen come in) had ordered a meal for him and his two boys (roughly 7 and 9 years old) and went on to have their meal. The father then comes back to the register and screams on top of his lungs that **""one of my kids cut their finger on a screw that was loose on the chair he was sitting on!!""**. He then proceeds to grab said chair and throws it over the counter towards one of our cashiers.

Yes, you read that correctly.

**He threw the frickin' chair towards one of our cashiers**.

Apparently it didn't hit her but I'm not sure that I would've been able to keep my cool if it happened to me, unless I would be too flabbergasted to be able to comprehend what just happened.

Our then roughly 150 cm tall, thin, blonde-haired shift manager who at the time was 16 and was the nicest person you could ever deal with then went out to have a little talk with said dad. On your shittiest of shitty days when you felt like putting your head in the fryer instead of the french fries she could come in and say ""HI MagneTism!"" and all your problems would go away. That's how happy and nice she was. Not today. Game face on.

She walks up to the dad and says with the most straight-faced and serious look I've ever seen:

**Awesome Happy Shift Manager:** Do you think that you, as a father, is setting a good example for your boys here by doing that? Do you think that behaviour is acceptable? Do you think that you're being a good role model?

His face was so red with shame that we probably got slightly skin tanned by his insecurity. He apologised for his behaviour so much I thought he was never going outside of his house again.

Still, the fuck dude? Anger management pls.

**TL;DR:** Anger management pls.",Let's assault the cashier for no reason,485,talesFromRetail
beloitpiper,52,,68,1o5j6c,,396,"I’m a long time lurker on this sub, but I thought I’d post something that happened a few years ago.  I used to work in a very high-end specialty cheese shop that cut everything fresh from the wheel.  Customer service was a big priority there and I did my best to make customers comfortable and happy.

On a normal day, I was behind the counter and this demanding customer (DC) comes in.  “Hi there.  What can I help you with today?” I ask.  She doesn’t look up from the display cases, but just mutters “I want some Roquefort.”  Now, Roquefort is a very delicious bleu cheese from France, but it is also very expensive.  It retailed for $45/pound at this store.  

“No problem,” I reply, “How much would you like?”

“I want to taste it first,” she informs me, still glued to the case windows.  I pull out the cheese and lop off a sliver of the cheese.  She looks at it curiously and then up at me with a very sour expression.  “I have $6.  I want $6 worth of it.”

I do the math in my head and that’s about 1/8 of a pound—barely half our ¼ pound minimum.
“I’m sorry, our minimum is ¼ of a pound, which would be about $11 or $12.  I can help you pick out a less expensive bleu cheese though,” I say as I point out some other options.

“I only have $6!  Do your best—I can only have the Roquefort.”  DC snarls.  With that, I take the wheel and shave off a paper-thin slice of the cheese.  I weigh it and it still comes to about $7.50.
“This is the best I can do.  It’s $7.50.  Would you like me to wrap it up?”

You’d think I had just confessed to being Miley Cyrus’ choreographer.  The daggers shooting from her eyes were razor sharp.
“No.  I guess I’ll take that.  It’s amazing that you can’t even listen to your customers when you charge these prices!” DC ranted.  I wrap the cheese and go to the register.  She pulls some wadded-up bills and random coins out of her pocket.

“Ma’am, this is only $7.35.  Do you happen to have 15 cents?” I ask.  She grumbles and pulls out some more random change from her pocket.  I sweep the coins from the counter and notice one looks a bit off.
“Ummm, this isn’t American.  In fact, I think it’s a German Mark.  They don’t even make these anymore…” I say puzzledly.

With that, she stands straight up, points her chin high in the air, eyes wide open, and starts thumping her chest bellowing “Mea culpa!  Mea culpa!”

I was stunned.  I froze—not knowing what to do.  With that, my manager who, up until this time was kind of watching me bemusingly, approaches her and says, “That’ll be fine.  Just take you cheese and go.”  She gives me a sly look on her way out, as if she had just won some sort of battle, but I think I won for having such an odd story to tell.

toxlab,54,,48,1a77t6,,395,"I lucked into a great job working for an independent video game retailer. This was back in the day when SNES and Genesis ruled the land, and the Neo Geo and 3DO were the shining examples of high end gaming.

I worked at an old school coin-op arcade in high school, and when they closed down the owners sold me a full sized Tapper machine for fifty bucks. It graced the living room of my bachelor pad for about a year before a friend told me that a new store had opened up in his neighborhood. The owner wanted coin-ops for the sales floor of a game store. I met with the guy and he was super cool. Turns out he needs someone with product knowledge to run a booth at a flea market on the weekends. After a couple of months of this, I earn his trust and start working 4 days a week at the retail store and doing weekends at the ""dirt mall'

""Gene"" was a different breed of cat. He wasn't a gamer, but he knew what was up. He DEMANDED we play new games the second they were released, and based his purchases on our recommendations. When games like Mortal Kombat came out, we would make up xeroxed cheat sheets for the fatalities and sell them for a buck a piece. If we could buy a used game and resell it that day, he would let us pocket the difference. Plus cash advances, gas money, and weekly poker and Jack Daniels parties in the back room.

The thing that really separated him from every other retailer I've ever worked for was his business savvy. If you brought him regular business and were a decent human being, he would move heaven and earth for you. He made a 200 mile round trip to pick up extra Game Gears one Christmas when none were available in our area. He got import games for Sega CD for our loyal weaboos. If you bought a new game we recommended and you felt it wasn't up to snuff, he'd give you full exchange value and just sell it as used. Our customers loved him. Most of them.

We had machines set up upfront to ""test"" used games. This was back in the dark ages when cartridge based systems roamed the land, and repairing a used game usually amounted to blowing on the pins. Still, we'd let you play Sonic for a couple of minutes to assure full value. The problem was the store was in a strip mall, and people would go into the restaurants with their friends, and tell Junior to go waste time with the vidya until mommy had her fill of gossip and came to collect their crotch-fruit.

Gene was not a babysitter, In fact, truth be told, he spent most of his time in his office watching porn on a pirated connection. He hated kids. They didn't understand release dates, trade in values, or system compatability. Little Vern would want Street Fighter Five Extra Mega Super Edition (The one with Pikachu and naked Chun Li) because that's what Timmy said he had at home, and Mom and Dad wouldn't understand why we couldn't fulfill a simple request for the birthday boy. After all, an eight year old knows better than SOME GODDAMNED MORON WHO PLAYS VIDEO GAMES FOR A LIVING AND ARE YOU CALLIN' MY KID A LIAR?

Gene gave these customers what I called, the ""Invitation to the World"". Hey, it's a big wide world out there. We sell games. What we don't do is babysit your mutant hellspawn until you deem fit to pick them up. Maybe there's someone out there who does that, Possibly while charging you a service charge. Go there. That's my version of it. Gene's version was more like, ""Hey, fucko. Collect your retarded offspring and get the fuck out of my store. Next time you leave them here, I offer them up to the creepy thirty year old with a paper route."" Hilarity would often ensue. When one clueless individual stated that he had a RIGHT to leave his children unsupervised in the store while he partook of frosty libations at the steakhouse, and then threatened Gene with physical violence, Gene calmly removed his 9 millimeter from under the counter, racked a shell into the chamber, and said, ""Walk out or get dragged out. Your choice."" We never saw Daddy dearest again.

It was a gamer's wet dream. Serious players come in? We got the hook up. You get top shelf gaming all day long. Rentals on street date, Used prices that cant be beat, and fair trade ins. New to games? We'll get that shit done, son. Find the perfect system from you, clue you in to the gaming franchises that will have you ballin' all night. Love Street Fighter II? Hell, beat my Vega and I'll give you a freebie off the rack. Come in with your three year old copy of Dragon's Lair for SNES (the rotten ringpiece of Super games), with no box or instructions, and insist it's worth sixty bucks because that's what you paid for it? I can't give that partial birth abortion of a game away for ten brand new. Why dont I trade your 75 Gremlin in for a brand new Corvette while I'm at it? No, I am the manager. Would you like to meet the owner? Okay. No problem. Let me tear him away from whatever vagina based programming he's watching and get him out here. Oh, he's obviously impressed by the big money you claim to spend here, despite no one on staff ever having laid eyes on you before. Wait. Is he? Yes, I believe he's bending over, spreading his cheeks, and demanding that you ""just shove it in and break it off!""

I spent two years at the foot of the master. Every day was an adventure. It was satisfying on so many levels. 
I may never be a master gamer. I may never have my own business. But someday, maybe, I'll be one tenth as cool as Gene.

snowangel223,97,,100,15vx48,,393,"I worked a few years at a big box store's Portrait Studio. You run into the most ridiculous customers here, and if you think being a cashier is bad.. try spending at least an hour if not more time doing everything from sales to acting like a complete imbecile to try and make children smile for the camera.

We do EVERYTHING. Photography, clown around for the kids, pose them, sales (no commission, but it mattered), cash register, delivery (give portraits to customer who pick up), passports, customer service, phone calls, booked appointments, outreach, cold calling, contests... it was a jack of all trades type roll. (Yet jobs don't seem to consider it ANYTHING on the resume. *grumble*

Here are the events to one of the worst days working at this job:

It was a busy Saturday afternoon and it was only myself and my one coworker. We had only worked together a couple of months and I had been at the job maybe 6 months. I think one other girl was supposed to be there but ""called in sick"" - details are fuzzy on that one. If she did, it's no surprise. It happened often with [THAT ONE](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15xe5c/compulsive_liar_aka_that_one/).. there are many stories with her I won't currently go into.

It had been an extremely busy day with almost all back to back appointments. No lunch breaks for either of us.. I know it's the law, but sometimes it's THAT busy. We have 2 camera rooms and my coworker was in one with a family. I was just able to get a breath after a customer left and in walks a man at around 2:15pm saying he has a 2:00pm appointment for a family portrait. Me: ""Are you the Smiths?"" (my 2pm appointment) Him: ""No, my name is Singh"". I don't find him on my schedule and let him know so (he's aggravated) while I'm still searching. Ah! I found it.... at 2pm like he said, but yesterday. I let him know his appointment was yesterday. He is livid. He starts yelling and blaming us for booking the wrong day. I say I can try my best to fit him in..My 2pm doesn't seem to be showing up and can take him in right away. ""Who's going to be in the photos?"" I ask. ""My family."" ...Me: ""And they are... ?"". Next thing I know he's on his cell calling his wife and screaming at her for them not being at the studio. He tells her they have an appointment. Gee, I wonder where the confusion of the appointment came about. He's a lot more calm now as he is embarrassed by this. He tells me they can be here in an hour. I say, sorry we have a 3:00pm and are fully booked until closing. At this point my coworker has come out of her photo room to see what is going on. She pipes up in front of him ""No, take him in. That 3pm canceled"". I stare right into her eyes, ""are you sure?"" ""yes."" ""your positive?"" ""yes"". Me: ""Okay, I can take you and your family at 3pm"". Situation was resolved... pfft, that's a laugh.

3pm rolls around and his family walks in ready for their photos. Who walks in next? Of course you knew this was coming. My 3pm walks in! They are pleasant and start getting ready in the lobby type area. Okay, so there are 2 camera rooms and only 2 of us and my coworker is still doing baby photos in one room and I now have standing here 2 families expecting photos right this minute. I HATE my coworker right now. She's actually quite lovely, but seriously HOW can you make a mistake like that? How could I listen to her and not just call the customer to confirm? Oh but reddit, I don't think you saw this coming. In walks a very plump and loud lady with 3 adorable but rowdy TRIPLETS! Triplets I tell you. I am not joking when as soon as they walked in they separated in a full run to play, scream and circle me JUST like in a film.  I actually stood in awe for a moment at how weird it was that they would do that as brats do on the hollywood screen. Who was this lady? Why she was my 2pm who never showed up. I let her know her appointment was over an hour ago now, and she was ANGRY. In a booming voice she blames ME! ""I told them I would be late when booking! I told them! How am I supposed to do this with triplets!"". Utter hog-wash because although we were heavily booked, they would have at least booked her at 2:30, not 2pm! Standing before me I had 3 families demanding photos that very minute. Out of all the chaos this one young girl walks in and asks to pick up her photos. Simple, right? Wrong.. it takes like 1/2 hour to deliver photos. You have to make sure the order is correct, then up-sell with the extra photos that are in the package and put it through the system so they don't come back saying they never picked up. All I can muster is ""I am SO sorry, is there any way you could possibly come back tomorrow?"" I'm usually great with customer service, I would have given her free stuff. She was extremely sweet and agreed. I was so overwhelmed and thankful she would do that for me.. I'm not sure I would have been so nice myself. The original man from yesterday's appointment? Oh, he went BESERK on my ass! Screaming! ""If that was me who came to pick up photos I would be SO angry! Why are you understaffed!? You have all these appointments! Why are you understaffed!!?"" I literally had tears in my eyes and took the berating and mustered that I would take in the original 3pm as fast as I could and would take both the other appointments in as soon as I could. The rest of the day was a blur. The portrait studio still gives me nightmares sometimes.. there are so many other stories. But I tell you, to this day I REALLY wish I had more courage and just said ""Your appointment was yesterday! Your appointment was over an hour ago! Even if we had more employees, we only HAVE 2 camera rooms, how does THAT help? If you don't like the amount of employees on, do you REALLY think I'm the one to yell at about it!? Both of you F* off, I'm taking in the 3pm!""

Thanks for letting me rant Reddit &lt;3

TLDR: Listen to your gut and stand up for yourself in a proper manner.

EDIT: I meant that I would take in the original **3pm** and fit in the others when I could. &amp; I really wanted to tell them all to fuck off except for the **3pm** who were on time for their appointment and did nothing wrong. Sorry, I just wrote the wrong number down, It was VERY late when I wrote this. Of course I took in the 3pm with the appointment who wasn't late, that was the most sane thing to do. The 2pm was the least of my worries of the group.

EDIT2: Thanks for all the comments. For those of you wanting to know about [THAT ONE](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15xe5c/compulsive_liar_aka_that_one/) I made a post for her.","It doesn't matter WHEN my appointment was, I'm here now!",493,talesFromRetail
MissInDeceased,21,,79,1mvtyd,,400,"Oh boy TFR, do I have story for you.  
  
I work in a dark store directed towards young adults. This happened last Wednesday.   
  
I was working my opening shift, 9:30 to 5:30, and a customer came in with a return. She had bought some dresses at a different location, and she wanted to return one because she didn't like the way it looked.   
  
No big deal, it was not worn, she had the receipt. I started on the return, and she saw another dress that she liked. She wanted the dress, so I turned the return process into an exchange.   
  
Everything was going smoothly, then she asked me a question about our coupon promo.  
  
For the last month or so, we have been giving out coupons to customers who spend $30+. For every $30 they spend, they get a coupon to save them $15 on a $30 purchase on a later date.   
  
So she is returning this dress, then asks me, ""I bought these at (different location) and I got these coupons. Could I return these dresses on the day these coupons start, then buy them back and use the coupons?""  
  
I'm incredulous. Really? I tell her that she can't, because she got those coupons BECAUSE she bought those items. What she wanted to do would scam us out of $15-30. She accepts it, takes her new dress, and leaves.   
  
I'm off the next day, but I hear this from my ASM.   
  
This woman comes back, returns EVERYTHING that she bought at the other location, plus the dress she exchanged. She has her family with her, husband, kids, the whole shebang. The return goes as normally.  
  
But the husband shows up AN HOUR LATER, not surprisingly, wanting to buy the same exact things that the woman just returned. And he wanted to use his coupons.   
  
As weird as this sounds, another woman came in after the return, tried on EVERY SINGLE THING that the woman returned, loved it, and put it all on hold.   
  
So my ASM told the husband just that, all the items he was looking for were no longer available, even though his own wife returned them just an hour ago.  
  
He was LIVID. He thought we were withholding the merchandise on purpose. MyASM assures him that we would never withhold merchandise, he just came in a little too late.   
  
The woman (who put the clothes on hold after they were returned) came back to get her merchandise the next day, and she used her coupons. FAIRLY.   
  
I've been working at this place for 4 years, and this is my favorite story so far.

themagnumopus,30,,64,1hvsr2,,394,"This story comes from a time when I worked at a gas station/convenience store. (Warning: Long)

Now, when this story takes place I am working a nice 7-3 shift on a Saturday, which means my weekend manager is in doing her thing, and we have an attendant for the full service pumps. Our company was very big on the customer always being right, and only allowing the refusal of sale if we were in danger. Its important to this story to note that we only had one register and while at it I had to turn a full 180 in order to see the diesel pumps.

At around 10 am I am minding my own business, talking to a few regulars and just generally doing my thing, the manager is out getting change for the safe and running surveys. I see out of the corner of my eye that a rather disgruntled looking guy (Hereby known as DG) is storming towards the door, on the warpath. I greet him as sweetly as possible but before I can ask how I can help him he interrupts me with ""YOUR DIESEL PUMP IS BROKEN I GOT FUEL ALL OVER MY TRUCK AND I HAD MY WINDOWS OPEN AND I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL SOMEONE PAYS FOR THE DAMAGES""

My response ""I'm sorry about that sir, unfortunately I cannot provide you with reimbursements"" (He had used his card at the pump, so the fuel was paid for)

DG: ""I SAID SOMEONE WILL BE PAYING FOR THESE DAMAGES, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir she isn't here at the moment, I can give her a call if you'd like""

DG: ""YES, DO THAT, I DEMAND REIMBURSEMENT. I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I KNOW THAT THE DAMAGES WILL BE PAID FOR"" (I wish I was kidding about how many times he said that)

I call my manager and relay that there is a customer demanding her attention and she states that she will be returning shortly.

Me: ""Sir if you could step to the side so I may take care of these customers, she will be in shortly to talk to you""

After about 25 minutes she finally shows up, and I indicate that the idiot standing in the corner tapping his feet is waiting for her. He gives her the same spiel he gave me and she tells him exactly what I did. He demands she calls the head offices and she agrees to do so, leaving me with his oh so wonderful company while she goes to the back office to call.

After about five minutes of waiting on customers I hear ""I HOPE YOU AND YOUR MANAGER DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST HIDE FROM ME. I AM NOT GOING AWAY UNTIL SOMEONE PAYS FOR THE DAMAGES TO MY TRUCK""

At this point I am getting pretty pissed off. This guy has been here for almost an hour at this point, is holding up a line to the diesel pumps, and huffing around my store like an entitled asshole. Instead of telling him this I say ""Sir, my manager is trying to get ahold of the higher ups, please be quiet and patient she will be back with you as soon as possible. I cannot just give you money out of the register""

In the end my manager backed me in that there is nothing we could do, if he wanted to file charges he could call the police or leave and call complaints on his own. After about ten minutes of her threatening to call the police he finally leaves, threatening to sue and have our jobs.

We didn't hear much about him until a little while later when my boss got a call from complaints telling us that they reviewed the tape, he had purposely sprayed his truck with diesel and then filled his tank, and was just trying to get free fuel and that he was banned from the stores.

EnticingPlague,44,,68,1dwx15,,392,"When I was in high school I worked for an electronics store. I became very good at spotting out shoplifters as I was forced to walk around a specific area of the store for hours on end. Once I noticed a kid playing PlayStation to a system attached to an end-cap at the back corner of the store. He was very fidgety every time I walked by and he would retract his hand from behind a small opening between the system and the endcap. I suspected he was up to something so I stayed in the area and he wandered off. When he left I looked in the area between the endcap and the system and sure enough there was a copy of a Wii game there unwrapped. The game was missing as well. The kid was about 12 years old and me being a high school student I decided to try to retrieve the game from him just by talking to him. I didn't want to get him into any major trouble, as my manager was known to be a terrible person. I basically told him that if he gave me back the game that I would not report him and that would be the end of it. He looked very ashamed and apologized to me but did give me the game back.

Fast forward about three months, the same kid is back in the store. This time I see him doing the exact same thing, only this time he is trying to steal a PSP (we had not spider wrapped them, as they were fresh out of the warehouse). I saw his eyes light up and he tried to exit the store but not before I told the asset protection guy at the front of the store. I'm not sure what happened to that kid but I hope he learned his lesson. Retail jobs are boring, the most exciting part of the job is catching shoplifters.

emilylime4,66,,100,1i99oa,,392,"This happened a few months ago, but it's as accurate as I can remember. I work as a cashier at a pet store, and it still amazes me how rude some customers can be. Expect more stories. 

ANYWAY.

I was working the register during the day, and we usually get a pretty brutal post-work rush around 4 or 5 pm. An older white woman, baggy cat t-shirt and all, comes in with her husband. I do my customary, ""Hello! Can I help you with anything today?"" ...and it begins. We'll call her Mary and her husband can be Bob.

Mary: Yes. I need cat litter.

Me: Okay! Cat litter right in that aisle [pointing] with all of our cat toys. 

Mary: Okay. [walks away]

And with a stern, tight-lipped look, she left, and I was able to deal with the other six people trying to check out at my one register.

Fast forward 15 minutes, and the lady comes up to my register positively fuming. I'm by myself again. 

Mary: Can someone help me with cat litter? I can't find the cat litter I'm looking for. 

Me: Yeah, no problem. I can help you! [At this point, I give a look to my manager down the nearest aisle, communicating that I'm leaving so he'll have to ring]

Me: [in the aisle] So, what litter are you looking for?

Mary: I'm looking for [lesser known cat litter]

Me: Ma'am, it's right here. [I can literally touch it with my hand. It is right next to me on the shelf]

Mary: Well, it should have been easier to find! The packaging all looks the same.

She's in a huff, and Bob is completely silent. He looks defeated. Poor Bob.

Me: I'm sorry about that Ma'am, but this IS the litter you're looking for, correct? 

Mary: Yes. I would like it to go in the cart.

Me: [uhhhhhhhhhhhh okay? Bob looks fit enough. He's a big guy. I'm a tiny girl but I can pick up bags no problem. Buuuut okay?] Sure Ma'am. How many bags would you like? 

Mary: Two

And without a thank you, I put the bags in her cart, and walk back up to the front with them to pay for their items. I find my manager with a line and a LOT of bagging to do, so I help him out. I notice Mary is once again, huffing and puffing like a blowfish. 

She finally gets her turn, and my manager has since gone to the office to let me ring up items by my lonesome. Cue real trouble.

I scan her items, she swipes her card, she gets her senior discount and loyalty discount, and I think I've done everything right. Not in her eyes! Just as she's slowly pushing her cart to the door, she explodes.

Mary: Um, excuse me! This is not the litter I wanted!

Me: [confused] It's not? 

Mary: Of course it isn't! This is non-clumping cat litter! I wanted clumping!

Me: [uhhhh but I asked you?] I'm sorry about that Ma'am, Would you like to return it?

Mary: Yes! Give me my money back! This is not the litter I wanted! Go get me the clumping litter!

Me: [little peeved, staying calm] I'm sorry Ma'am, but I'm just going to have to have you fill out this return form so we can get you your cat litter.

Mary: I'm not doing that! Just give me the different litter!

Me: [REALLY pissed] Ma'am, this is company policy. You have to fill out the form so I can give you your money. [I shoot a look to my manager, hoping he can see the necessity for his presence in my eyes]

I must add, that while this is going on, poor Bob has left Mary and is now looking at our pet-themed greeting cards. 

Manager walks over and asks: What seems to be the problem today?

Mary: The problem is that she picked out the wrong litter! This litter is WRONG!

Manager: Okay, we just need you to fill out this return form so we can give you your money back. 

Mary: I already told HER [jab of a finger in my direction] that I'm NOT filling it out! And why hasn't anyone gone to get my new litter yet?!

Manager: Let us call someone to get it for you.

Me: [paging unsuspecting stock boy]

He arrives, I tell him what we need, which is only a 15 second walk away, and he comes right back up with the bags and another stock boy. This is turning into a show.

As Mary stands with her hand on her hip, lips so tight I wonder how long she can sustain that face, my manager just rings her up with the returns. 

Manager: Ma'am, your total comes out to [about] 15 dollars.

Mary: WHAT? BUT I'M RETURNING THESE ITEMS. [She is so in our faces at this point that I back away from the register and cower behind my manager.]

Manager: Yes, but the new ones are more expensive, as they are clumping cat litter.

Mary: I did not know this! I thought they were the same price! 

Manager: No Mam.

She's deliberating in her head, then finally swipes her card. My manager remembers her discounts, thank god, and we give her the new receipt.

Bob comes back from his intense reading, starts pushing the cart, and Mary doesn't say anything back when we tell her to have a good day.

My manager turns to me and says, ""when that happens, just get them out of the store as quickly as possible. Just write that the customer refused on the return form.""

And with that I was left to explain Mary to my stock boys who had only witnessed the end.

What really gets to be about it is that I asked her if it was the litter that she wanted. She said yes! She saw the other litter bag, same brand, on the shelf, and CLUMPING and NON-CLUMPING have to be in the 72 pt font range. Ridiculous.

Rubychan11,83,,89,1qwqa2,,394,"Short and so-not-sweet one here... I just got a call from one of my coworkers. She was in tears, her voice barely a whisper. Her mother had just recently gotten back surgery, so she had fresh stitches. Well, apparently the mother is very independent, doesn't like to admit she needs help, so she went to take a shower on her own. Biiiiig no no. The poor thing slipped and fell, opening the stitches and knocking her unconscious.

So of course, they take her to the ER. My coworker calls the manager and tells her what happened, saying please can she be excused from her shift--mind you, she's giving at least 4 or 5 hours' notice, and I would think this would be considered an emergency. Plus it's Monday... we are so not busy on Mondays. Surely they'll let her off, right......?

Nope. The manager says that if she doesn't come in, she'll get written up. So she calls me and asks if I could switch shifts with her (her 8 hour for my 4 hour) and of course I said yes, but I'm boiling mad at the manager.

Is that even allowed? Isn't there some sort of extenuating circumstance if a close family member is in the hospital? It's just like... what the fuck?!

Schmoogly,29,,92,1i9uva,,390,"BEHOLD: THE GREAT WALL OF TEXT - the only man-made literary work visible from the moon. 

I used to work in a small music and DVD shop located on a train station concourse. The shop was very, very busy and very, very small. 

This story begins one balmy august evening when our keyholder (to whom I did, and will continue to refer to solely as ""The Idiot"") was taking the cash drawers out of the tills so we could close for the night. 

The Idiot decided to stack the till drawers so they were balanced on the edge of a bin which was full of customer's rubbish, and predictably, they all fell in. Several thousand pounds in coins and notes was thoroughly mixed in with customer's revolting rubbish. This stuff was all food and drink wrappers (bins are hard to come by in UK train stations thanks to the irritating habits of unsavoury people who kept putting bombs in them.)

I spent the next hour after closing digging through rubbish with my bare hands, trying to retrieve the day's takings. The bin STANK, it was a hot day and it was full of ice cream wrappers and almost a full inch of miscellaneous food sludge into which all the change had fallen. To his credit, The Idiot did help out a bit. This didn't stop me and the rest of our staff from giving him a hard time. The tills were eventually refilled and handed to The Idiot so he could waddle off and lock them in the safe in the office. I went home. 

The next day I got in for the 5:30am morning shift to discover my Assistant manager on the phone to our head office as the safe would not open. It turned out that in his frustration, The Idiot had continued to live up to his name by slamming the safe door, thereby breaking the safety glass and rendering it permanently locked. 

Head office told us that they could send someone out to fix it, but it would be 11am at the earliest, which would mean that we would have to operate for 4 hours without any cash drawers. 

We made signs with ""CARD OR EXACT CHANGE ONLY - apologies for any inconvenience"" and put them in front of all the tills. We were also explaining the situation to everyone who came into the shop as they walked in. 

Everyone seemed to understand, or so I thought.

So this oldish fella walks up to the till, he's in his late 50's and is brandishing a couple of DVDs. I explain the situation about the change drawers and tell him that he can either pay on his card or pay in exact change. He looked confused. His total was £19.99 and he had a £20 note. I told him he can either forego the penny or come back later when we've got the tills. (I had already checked my pockets and given out the four pennies I had on me that morning). 

His reaction was priceless. He exploded ""WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY, EH? WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY!?"" Again I told him that we don't have any pennies to give, again he got angry. ""THIS IS DAYLIGHT ROBBERY! LET'S SEE WHAT THAT POLICEMAN HAS TO SAY ABOUT YOU ROBBING ME!"" he gestured to a policeman who was patrolling the concourse. ""I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR THIS!""

I told him ""You haven't bought anything yet. At present we do not owe you a penny, I am simply informing you that if you were to buy this DVD in cash, it would be on the condition that you would not receive your penny change. You can pay by card, you can forego the penny change, or you can come back later when we've retrieved our change drawers from the safe.""

I watched as the cogs and wheels in his head slowly whirred into place. He looked down at the DVDs in his hand and then back up at me.  ""I'm not happy about this"" he said as he handed over the £20 note. When he left he did go for a chat with the policeman, I think he was expecting plod to leap into action, round up all the shop staff and send us to jail. The less dramatic reality was that the copper shrugged and I got back to work.  

Addendum - Loose ends

The Idiot wasn't reprimanded too harshly for breaking the safe or dropping the till drawers, he sucked-up to the manager extra hard for about 2 weeks.

We received no overtime payment for the hour spent digging through the bins. 

I got an infection in the nail-bed of my finger about a day later. It was very painful and I blame having to dig through garbage for change. 

The old man returned the DVDs after 1 week. He apparently wanted his extra penny refunded as well, though I was not working that day.","""Well, lets see what that policeman has to say about you ROBBING ME.""",482,talesFromRetail

Last night at work, a man and woman in their late forties/early fifties walked up hand in hand to me at the jewelry counter. I asked them if I could help them with anything, and the man said, ""No, this is our first date so we're just looking around."" A little confused, I asked him ""You're on your first date at *insert retail store here*?"" and the woman responded saying ""Well we've known each other for over 20 years. We dated in high school, but things didn't work out and recently got back in touch.""

I told her I thought that was sweet that they found each other again, and that they looked very happy together. The woman thanked me and looked to her date and said she was going to quickly look at the shoes. As soon as she rounded the corner, the man asked me to pick my favorite diamond ring from the counter as he was going to propose that night. I helped him pick out a beautiful ring as quickly as I could, so that the woman wouldn't see the ring before she got back.

Today the couple came in again, SHE SAID YES! They wanted to thank me for helping the man keep the proposal a surprise and helping him pick out such a beautiful ring. These were by far the best customers I have ever had. ","Not your typical tale, cute with happy ending",469,talesFromRetail

[Why am I bleeding? Or, how simple statements can lead to assault charges](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1boqxq/why_am_i_bleeding_or_how_simple_statements_can/)  
[Yelling a the wrong guy, or, how a bitchy lady learned what handcuffs felt like](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1bag6d/yelling_at_the_wrong_guy_or_how_a_bitchy_lady/)

Before I begin, I should preface this by saying that the stories I'm telling here are in no way actually in chronological order.  It's more of a ""oh, hey, remember that one time that..."" kind of story telling.

This even occurred late in the shift.  It was dark out, and traffic had died off to almost nothing.  Our station is (present tense, it's still there, even if I don't work there) located at the beginning of a cul de sac, along with an oil-and-lube shop, a family diner, a dentist's office, a McDonalds, and a flower/coffee shop.  There was just myself and another employee out playing gas attendant, but since there weren't any customers, we were instead standing in the middle of the pumps, conversing as co-workers do.  I also had my phone out, texting my then-girlfriend.  Aside from the roar of the nearby freeway, the world was, for the moment, quiet.

But slowly, we heard a noise.  It was obviously coming closer, but truck traffic made it hard to determine what it was, let alone where it was coming from.  After a few minutes, we determined that it was a human voice, yelling something.  It soon became apparent that the voice was coming from a woman up the street a bit from the cul de sac.  She was, in fact SCREAMING her lungs out.  As she wandered her way up the street vaguely in our direction, we began to ""understand"" what she was saying.  Mostly it was gibberish, word salad without form or grammar, with the occasional guttural moan or shrill yelp.  A few coherent phrases came through as well, the most memorable of which was ""Come back me up, Marines!""

My associate and I watched in stunned/disturbed fascination as this mad woman walked up our cul de sac and entered the McDonalds.  No, ""entered"" isn't the right term.  She *CONQUERED* herself in there, like a cowboy hero busting open the swinging half-doors to the saloon in an old western, right before he challenges the bad guy in a black hat to a high-noon show down.

Once inside, we could see her moving around.  Not up at the counter, but amongst the tables and chairs.  She spent several minutes in there, and it was obvious that the McDonalds staff wasn't happy about it, because the guy we knew to be manager was pointing to the door and saying something to her.  She did not appreciate being informed where the egress was, as she started to throw around items like trays, handfuls of napkins, straws, cup lids, whatever detritus she could find, and running full tilt from the counter to the bathrooms and back again.

My associate and I chuckled.  Poor Mickey-Ds schmucks.

At some point, her eccentric (ha!) orbit of the dining area destabilized, and she was ejected from the premises by her own inertia.  The two of us on the pumps then turned our heads, as we didn't really want to deal with something like that right before quitting time.  However, we were either too slow or not camouflaged well enough, because her next course change sent her directly our way.

I still had my phone out, sending updates on the weird event to my gf.  The crazy lady approached, but didn't really seem like she was interested in communing with whatever it was she thought we were.  That is, until, she saw my phone out and my thumb on the keypad.  THAT piqued her interest, and in none-too-kind a manner.  She stalked over to me, came within about 18"", and hiss-whispered, ""If you call the cops, I'm going to fucking kill you.""  Oh dear.  That's not exactly what you would call a smart threat, given that she then wandered towards the parking lot on the back side of the store, still shouting randomly and occasionally flailing her large purse around.  Out of reach and out of eyesight, I called it in.  My co-worker wandered a bit over to the side, to see if she was going to mess with anything in the back.

Apparently, I wasn't the only one who had called 911 about this lady, because the police response time, already quite quick, was extraordinarily fast.  Well under 2 minutes, as I was still giving information to the dispatcher when the two units arrived.  Just as the officers got out of their cars, we heard a loud crash of breaking glass, along with my co-worker yelling ""HEY!!"" and pointing at the woman.  The two officers broke into a run, as did I, and came around the corner to find her with a piece of pipe that had been left near the recycling bin, smashing the window to the small outbuilding which contained some sort of monitoring equipment for the underground gas tanks.

The moment she saw the two officers, however, it was like a switch got flipped.  She instantly calmed down, and became intelligible.  She put down the pipe, and complied with the officers as they asked her to come out to the front of the store (which was on camera and better lit).  The officers asked her for ID, which she calmly produced from a back pocket.  Another officer arrived at this point, but went down to the McDonalds to talk with the manager.  The two officers with the lady were interviewing her, asking her what might be the reason that people were calling about her, her responding that she was just having a bad night, etc etc.  After a few minutes of this, the officer who had been down at the McDonalds came up to talk to us two pump jockeys.  We relayed our perspective of what happened to him, and he went over to the other two officers.  Now, I'm uncertain as to what that officer said to the other two, but he soon went back to his car and began to drive it up to our parking lot.  As that was happening, the two officers with the lady asked her to stand, and if they could search her purse.

This is, as they say, the climax of the story.

For she stood, as she was asked, and grabbed her purse, as if to drop it.  However, instead of doing so, her hand returned with a small-caliber compact pistol, which she raised up and fired.  Now, thankfully, she didn't actually point the thing AT anybody.  Her aim was directly between the two officers, and both of us wage slaves were off to her left.  So the three rounds she fired weren't REALLY a danger to anyone, with the exception of a possible ricochet or that poor barkdust hillside which took three rounds amidships.

The two officers with her reacted instantly, not with guns drawn, but with a very well choreographed double tackle.  Her gun was taken from her hands as she squirmed and screamed all manner of vile epithets.  The third officer heard the shots, and his big V-8-Interceptor-Packaged-Police-Charger roared up between the pumps.  The three officers had a hell of a time getting her into cuffs, because even though she was slight, she was feisty.

Eventually she was controlled with handcuffs and leg restraints, along with the arrival of another couple officers and eventually an ambulance.  One officer had sustained a rather nasty cut to his forehead during the struggle, the cause of which I do not know.  The woman, now lying in the back of a police cruiser, still screaming and trying to kick the window, was being taken to jail for booking and then almost immediately to a hospital for a psych eval.  The two officers were visibly quite shaken, and I overheard them asking if they could take the rest of their shift off.  In a quiet community like that, it's not often that officers end up being shot at.

In the end, I believe that the lady was committed for sanity issues, which does make me feel bad for her.  A crime scene tech recovered the bullets from the hillside (which, I'm happy to say, recovered from it's injuries) and we were thanked by the police officers for our quick call to 911.  I went home, drank a couple beers, and went to sleep, dreaming of crazy ladies.

TL;DR - One of the better night's sleep I've ever had, actually.

AlphaEnder,37,,102,1aohmu,,395,"This was about a year and a half ago, but I figured I'd tell it anyways.

Guy comes into parking, absolute shitter of a car. Normally I don't mind or care much, but he's not driving so great and parks in handicap without plates or tags indicating it. Also, his plate is duct taped to his car. This sets off a few alarms. I watch him come inside. 

Now, for some bizarre reason our merch manager decided that the pallet of Xbox 360 Kinect bundles should be the very first pallet. As in maybe four steps into the warehouse, and bam, there it is.

So the guy walks in, grabs one, and starts to head out. Notices me watching him. I'm a big guy, and while I might not be good at long distance, I'm close enough to snag him if he takes off. He turns to the greeter and asks where returns are. She knows what's up, but she's all of 95 pounds and wouldn't be able to pull it from him anyways, so she just points him to the line. I walk up to him while he's standing there, everyone watching. 

""Sir, that's not yours.""

""What? No, it is, I brought it in and I'm returning it.""

""Oh, okay. Tell ya what, it's cold and this is expensive. We'll take ya to the front of the line, get you out of here quickly."" As I'm saying this I'm gently pulling it out of his hands. He's too confused to even struggle for it.

""No man, I don't care it's not worth it. I don't even want to."" He walks very quickly back to his car and takes off. 

Right. You don't wanna return the $400 package you ""bought"", especially when I offer to expedite the return process. I almost ripped my manager's head off after that I was so angry. His idiocy put two employees in possible danger, not to mention could continue to put us in danger. The pallet was moved in about five minutes.

Of course, sometimes happy endings don't happen. A couple of weeks ago a lady came out the door, swearing up a storm. She had about $2,200 worth of merch in her cart, but about four cart guys all near her (just sheer luck). Her car pulls up and everyone is too shocked by her bizarre behavior and the erratic driving to even bother moving. She takes off with a $1,800 touchscreen computer. /facepalm/ We got her license and description as well as her face on camera, but I haven't seen her on bookings recently, so I can only hope some other department snagged her. Preferably one about a hundred miles west as that would slap two transportation of stolen goods across state boundaries to her list. Federal crimes, get her kids away from her. Oh, did I not mention that? She decided to bring her two kids with her on her felony spree.

littlewoolie,91,,65,1anqhg,,392,"Many years ago, I worked in a fast food place. A young boy (8-9yrs old, whom I will call Dickens) and 2 young girls (5-6 years old) came into my store with a man that appeared to be their father (Whom I will call ""F""). 

F asked Dickens to look at the menu and tell him what he wanted from it. F turned to the 2 girls and started talking to them about what they might like to order. Dickens asks me about different burgers and what items they come with in a meal. 

As I'm talking to him, Dickens tells me that he is here with his stepfather and his 2 half sisters. F then tells Dickens to hurry up and order. 

Dickens gets this look of ""I'm sorry, I won't do it again"" and tries to tell him what he would like for his meal. Unfortunately at that moment, F decided that Dickens wasn't worth listening to and started ordering for the girls and himself instead. 

Dickens now has a look of shock and disappointment and tries to repeat what he would like for dinner. F says, ""No! you took too long, I am just going to get you (insert cheapest burger meal here)"".

jessajuhanabi,30,,97,1rhnqp,,388,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

sugardrop,43,,105,1p9s70,,394,"I used to work at a chain Italian restaurant as a hostess. We often had people calling trying to make reservations. Our management would occasionally take them but only if they were at least 2 days in advance and only if the party was 8 or more. For the most part reservations were not accepted, especially not during weekend dinner rushes.

During football season one evening (college football, I live in a big 10 college town) we were absolutely *slammed* with people who were in town for the game that weekend. There was one man who called in and said, rudely, ""Party of 8 coming in. Get our table together."" I kindly informed him that we were on an hour and a half wait for large parties, and he could come in and get a pager. He seemed annoyed but grumbled something and hung up.

Sure enough I hear on the headset a bit later from our greet host saying that a man was in saying he had a reservation. I walk up and recognize him as the man on the phone from the way he spoke.

""I just called in and made a reservation."" he said to the greet host (we will call her Sarah). Sarah had worked there for a while and wasn't really new to this kind of trickery, so she looked at him and told him ""Sorry sir but you must have been mistaken, we don't take day-of reservations on weekends, especially game weekends. It will be 1 1/2 hours. Can I have your name?"" This man looked like he was about to LOSE it. It reminded me of the cartoons where people have steam blowing out of their ears with a red face. He says, ""but I just called and told them to be ready for us."" Sarah sighed. ""Yes sir, I understand, but my coworker told you that you'd have to wait. I'm sorry and we will get you down as soon as possible."" The guy's rage boiled over as he SLAMMED the pager down on the host stand and screamed (and this is my favorite part). ""YOU GIRLS...YOU HAVE A NICE DAY. NO. YOU HAVE A NICE. LIFE."" Being overly sweet to rude customers is my favorite thing ever, and Sarah said cheerfully, ""thanks sir, you too!"" as I smiled, ""I plan on it!"" He left with his pager (not really sure why, maybe an accident. We left him on the wait just in case.)

He came in maybe 20 minutes later and shoved the pager into my hands, saying ""You just lost $200. The steakhouse across the street got us in right away."" 

I heard later from our general manager (referred to now as Steve) who was an awesome guy even though he could sometimes be a hard ass, that a man had called during dinner rush telling him that the young lady at the host stand did him a disservice by turning away their business. Steve asked him what the problem was, and the man explained the situation saying that he would have to wait an hour and a half for a party of 8. ""That sounds about right for a party of 8 on football Saturday,"" Steve replied, ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"" The man said that he had gotten into the aforementioned steakhouse right away. My manager laughed and simply replied ""Thanks for letting me know that they have a hard time going on a wait on a football Saturday."" and hung up. Ha!

The Time: Late evening, near close

The Players: Me, an older lady, an unsuspecting cashier, and a random couple.

I walk into Qdoba late one evening, holding a coupon, a two-for-one with the purchase of a single entree and two drinks. There is a small line in front of me, so I shuffle in behind an older woman and a couple joins in right behind me. The lady in front of her orders a handful of things which take some time given there are only two people working the counter, which begins to frustrate the older woman. Eventually she gets up to the counter and places her orders and works her way down to the register. The girl at the cashier rings her up and the lady thrusts her coupon at her saying ""Here, I have this two-for-one coupon."" The girl takes the coupon and says ""No problem ma'am"" and places two cups on the counter next to her food. ""I don't want the drinks"" says the woman, pushing them back. ""I'm sorry ma'am, that's what the coupon is for. It's a free entree with the purchase of one and two drinks."" The woman gets a little flustered and thinks for a moment then says ""Okay fine, I'll just have one drink and both entrees."" ""That's fine, but you can't use the coupon unless you get two drinks"" says the cashier. ""But I don't want two drinks!"" she shouts back, ""Just ring it up"". At this point the other worker comes over and points out on the coupon where it says ""two drinks"" and the lady finally decides she won't use the coupon. She tells them she only wants one burrito and one drink. The cashier throws away the second burrito and begins to ring her up again, when the lady turns to me asking if I want her coupon, seeing that I have two burritos already made up. ""No, thanks, I've already got the same coupon."" She then goes up to the couple behind me, whose food is also now ready, and asks them the same thing. They gladly take the coupon, the lady pays and and walks out the door.

I give them no trouble at all, I pay my dues and go to get my drinks. The couple behind me does just the same and is being handed their receipt, when suddenly the lady comes back in. ""I changed my mind, give me back the coupon and the burrito."" The cashier and couple are a bit in shock, the cashier says ""I'm sorry, I can't do that. We've already thrown the burrito away and the coupon has already been used."" ""Well make me another one then and have them (pointing to the couple she gave her coupon to) pay for, after all it was MY coupon"" she demands. ""I can make you another burrito"" starts the cashier, ""but you'll have to pay full price for it. I'm not going to charge them for the coupon you gave to them."" At this point the lady realizes that not just the cashier and couple are staring at her in disbelief, but several other people as well, including myself.

""Fine, never mind, I don't need the extra food anyway"" she states and quickly rushes to the door.

MrSexyBooty,51,,63,16vuah,,385,"So, I work in fast food. Lets call this place MacFarmer. Now, in MacFarmer, I've NEVER seen the ability to take the card from them type it in the computer. 

Anyways, this lady comes in, makes a very large order (~$40) and tries to pay with her card. Tries being the operative word. I keep telling her it declines, but she's adament about making it work, blaming the decline on our machines. Yeah. Our machines screw up. Once in a blue moon, and thats usually because the card wasn't read right. This lady is getting angry with me. I'm sorry lady, but its your money.

She tells me to put the number in the computer. When I say she told me to do it, she ordered me. ""Put the digits in your computer. Your machine doesn't work worth a shit."" I tell her ""Ma'am, we don't do that here. Our machines can only use the card reader.""
She has the nerve to reply, ""Don't give me that SHIT, you have done it before!"" 

My manager decides to walk his happy ass over and asks what the problem is. He's looking at me to explain but before I get a chance, ""Dumbass over here is refusing to take my card!"" My manager is dumbstruck.

He asks her to swipe it, and she tells him our ""shitty machine doesn't work."" He then tells her to leave the store, and not to come back until she can behave herself. She calls corporate on us, and they take our side. But OH THAT'S NOT THE END OF HER.

Last Christmas (I think it was about 4 days before), I was out of town doing some shopping, I was in an EB games store looking for a few things. I was waiting in line behind this woman in her 60s or so. She gets to the counter and asks for ""That new Nintendo U thing"".

On to my story. I work at a gas station. A nice one, though. I would prefer not to reveal the name, but it's one of those large re-modeled fancy ones. Okay, that's enough of me defending my job. 

A woman comes in. She's thin and blonde. Late 20's to early 30's. She's wearing a tight track suit oufit. I imagine it was from Victoria's Secret. She's yacking loudly on her cell phone. She comes up to the register and tells me she wants $40 on pump 1. She wasn't really rude or anything, it just bugs me when people talk on their phones and then whisper to me like I'm interrupting their important call or something. She leaves.

I go back to what I was doing. About 15-20 minutes later she comes back. I greet her. 

Her: You're not going to believe this! I left without pumping my gas! I was on the highway when I remembered. How crazy is that?

Me: Oh. Heh. That happens sometimes.

My Mind: If you weren't yacking on your cellphone 24/7 this wouldn't have happened.

Me: [I look at my screen] Um it appears that someone pumped your $40 worth of gas. They could have done it by mistake.

Her: Well put the $40 on there again then.

Me: I can't really do that. You're going to have give me another $40. 

Her: Just put another $40 on there!

Me: Well, there is no $40. The money is gone, it's already been pumped. In order to fill your car up you will need to pay again.

Her: YOU OWE ME 40 BUCKS. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT SOMEONE PUMPED MY GAS.

Me: You...drove off without it so...it kind of...is your fault.

Her: WHO'S THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE? GET THEM.

There was no manager at the moment, so I grabbed the shift leader (SL) on duty.

SL: What's the problem?

Her: YOU OWE ME $40.

I explain the situation. The shift leader has a a major temper, by the way. They argue heatedly back and forth. I stand there dumbfounded by the stupidity of the situation.

Her: I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE. YOU ARE TERRIBLE EMPLOYEES. YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOU'RE JUST GAS STATION WORKERS.

She ended up putting $20 on a pump and stormed off.

babia_majora,98,,79,16jxho,,384,"I have worked for a large european fashion retailer in the uk for just over two years and this is one experience that I will probably always remember of my in fashion retail.

It's a busy saturday afternoon and I'm frantically trying to keep the floor looking presentable when a middle aged lady who looks fairly well-off approaches me and asks for my help. She says 'I have a £20 voucher and I need something for my neice.' I say that thats fine and ask what sort of thing she is looking for, and this is where it all goes down hill. 

'I don't know, anything, she's 19.' At this point I am a little confused, we are a large store housing many ranges to cater for as many people as possible, this means she has a LOT of options. I try to ascertain what sort of thing she might like only to recieve pointless snippets of info like 'she lives in australia and I need to send it to her' and 'she's quite conservative'. So long story short after a solid 30 minutes of selecting things and being rudely rebuffed I suggest one of our biggest orders at the time, a navy blue,  sleeveless, all-lace dress which is imo a gorgeous dress and it was £14.99 (a mega bargain) and a pack of silver bangles for £4.99. I've made the most of her £20 voucher and she agrees that they will be suitable for her neice. 

Here is where the shit hits the fan, I want to remind you that it is a Saturday, we are understaffed, have taken over our budget the last few weekends and suffer when Saturdays hit. I've spent the majority of 40 minutes hunting out the perfect gift for the lady who has been rude, unhelpful and unappreciative, but working in retail that's life. 

I take her to the till and begin to process the items where she opens her purse to retrieve the voucher, and I notice her purse is stuffed with notes, there had to be upwards of £500 cash in there. She finds the voucher and throws it at me. I pick it up to notice that it is a voucher for Topshop, this is not where I work, nor is it even part of the group of companies that I do work for, so I can't accept it. When I tell her this she flips, she argues that I have to take it and that I am ignorant and that she is right. She is all of 3 inches from my face shouting at me and co-workers and customers alike are just watching in shock. She continues to shout saying she'll never shop with us again and that 'an animal could see that she was right'. She then notices the crowd that has gathered and looking a little offended, throws the clothing on the floor and storms out.

I was so angry I could feel my heart rate in my eyeballs. Tyvm retail.

jdpatric,74,,88,1p293f,,388,"After reading [Layaway 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p1twd/layaway_101/) I thought of my time at the hardware store and rentals...I was going to post it there as a comment but it's just really long. 

I used to work at a small hardware store in a med/large town. We offered a few in store services and one of them was rentals. We had two different types of carpet cleaners we rented along with pressure washers. Each rental had a form we had to fill out on the computer. We didn't require an email address but we did require an in state drivers license (or some form of military ID), two phone numbers, and a credit card (we charged the deposit to the credit card). Note: If you're reading this you probably know that a debit card can be run as credit provided it has a major logo on it. I can't tell you how many people I've had to explain this to. Especially when cashiering. 

Here are a few stories of people doing rentals:

**Number one**

Angry guy comes in (AG).

AG - I need to patch a hose.

Me - OK, here's the aisle where we sell hose menders.

AG - No. It's for a pressure washer.

Me - What? Like gas powered 2000 PSI pressure washer?

AG - No; it's 3000 PSI.

Me - We don't sell anything to patch that kind of hose.

AG - Why?

Me - Because it could kill you.

AG - Oh...how much to rent a pressure washer hose?

Me - I don't think we rent just the hose out; let me check.

Me - Sorry you have to rent the machine. It's $50 with a $20 deposit that gets refunded when you return the machine.

AG - That's not too bad...sign me up.

Me - I need a drivers license and a credit card sir.

AG - Well I don't have a credit card; just cash.

Me - Sir the deposit is required to be on a card.

AG - I want to see a manager.

Manager tells him the same thing. Finally the guy gets agitated.

AG - If your store wasn't so cheap I could just use my Visa and this wouldn't be a problem.

Me - That'd work.

AG - No it wont! It's a debit card you idiot.

Me - Actually it will run quite nicely as either credit or debit; I have the same card from the same bank and use mine here at least once a week.

AG (obviously flustered and embarrassed as hell now) - Fine. Ring me up.

He called back later to complain that it wouldn't start. It was out of gas...he'd been trying to figure out what was wrong with it for an hour.

AG - What do you mean **I** have to put gas in it.

Me - Well sir, it runs on gas...? (didn't really know what else to say).

AG - You guys don't put gas in them for me?

Me - Sir, we don't sell gas here.

AG - *hangs up*

He tried to get a refund for the machine later. Was turned down.

**Number two**

A guy wearing a Bluetooth and a full business suit comes into the store in a HUGE hurry. (HH)

HH - I need to rent a carpet cleaner and I'm in a rush.

Me - Ok, I've done plenty of these and will have you out of here in no time. I need a drivers license and a credit card please.

HH - OK. *hands me the stuff*

On the rental form I was required to get a home and a cell phone. It was OK to get two cells...heck, even a relatives cell/home just so long as we had two legit phone numbers. This was a CYA for the cashier as much as for the owner; If the machine goes missing the owner has two places to call looking for it, and if the cashier puts two phone numbers (even if it was just a neighbor) then the cops had a second thing to go on...or so the owner told us. I was OK with it, it was the rules.

Me - OK, last thing; I need a home and a cell phone number.

HH - My cell is (when he said this I kind of expected the worst) 867-5309 (not really), just use that; you don't need my home phone.

Me - Sorry sir, the form requires two phone numbers for the rental. 

HH - Well, we don't give out our home phone number to anyone; we don't want telemarketers to call.

Me - We don't give this information out to anyone, in fact this particular computer isn't even connected to the internet.

HH - Well, I don't have a home phone. (lie?)

Me (slightly annoyed at being lied to) - Sir, I can use another cell...does your wife have one?

HH - Yes, but I'm not giving you that either.

My manager (who knew I was a veteran at this) had seen the debacle beginning to unfold and had stepped over to assist (thankfully).

Manager - It's the store policy from the owner sir. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do it you wont give us two phone numbers.

HH - This is insane. Fine. Here's my work cell. (really? all that?)

I ring him up and set him on his way. Didn't think anything of it. I the next had three days off due to the way my semester was scheduled at the time and then was on for four days. When I returned the owner was on the phone yelling at someone (not terribly unusual; owner was great but occasionally he had to call people and be ""that guy"").

The next day someone goes to return a carpet cleaner using the form the guy had rented it with the previous **WEEK** (at this point). There's a huge late fee which the guy had negotiated down a bit with the owner. Note: the guy returning HH's machine is not HH.

New guy (NG) - I need to return this.

Me - OK, do you have the card it was rented on? (expecting the worst; we needed the card to refund the deposit).

NG - Yeah, HH wont be needing it anymore. He's been fired.

Turns out the guy was a really mid-level fairly new employee at a local company who had invited a bunch of friends **to his office** to watch college football (they had several rather large TV's and projectors for conferences and such apparently) and party on Saturday with the intent of cleaning up the mess on Sunday. Something went awry when he tried to use his company card to pay for the rental and got caught.

**Number three**

 On a really cold day a sketchy guy and his equally sketchy wife/partner/not even sure what walk into the store and ask to rent a pressure washer. This is in Florida so cold is a relative term, but it was legit winter and the high was in the low 50's. I wouldn't want to pressure wash on a day like that.

Sketchy guy (SG) - I need to rent a pressure washer.

Me - OK, I need a drivers license and a credit card.

SG - Uhhhh, one sec, (says to sketchy lady (SL)) dig my license outta your purse for me. (Back to me) Can you fill the rest out while she does that?

Me - Ummm, sure; I don't see why not. I need a Home phone and a cell (moving to the next open brackets).

SG - Uhhhh, my cell is (insert number here) and I don't have a home phone.

Me - I need two numbers sir.

SL (very quietly and under her breath to SG) - Just make one up quick hun.

SG (Thinking that for some ungodly reason I couldn't hear SL) - Yeah uhhh...my home phone is (insert some obviously made up number here).

Me - Yeah. I'm not going to put that in. You just made that up.

SG - How do you know I didn't make the first one up?

I was about to reply saying ""because you didn't pause for 3-5 seconds between each number and forget our area code with the first one,"" when SL picked this moment to ""find"" SG's drivers license.

SL - Oh here's his license!

I take one look at it and I see the saddest excuse for a fake ID I've seen. Probably ever. It was beat to death. The guy on there, while also a very sketchy individual, was **NOT** SG.

Me - Sir, I'm sorry, I can't rent you this machine...this is not you in the picture.

The computer we used for rentals was LITERALLY on the wall of the owners office and the walls didn't connect to the ceiling so he could hear whenever we had a problem with a rental, and he had one way glass so they could see it too.

Owner (comes out of the office and tkaes the fake ID) - Sir, I'm going to ask that you hang around here for a few minutes until the police arrive or I wont be giving you ""your drivers license"" back.

SG - KEEP IT! *runs away with SL in tow*

Owner didn't really call the cops but pinned the ""license"" up to ward off future attempts to steal our machines.

**Number four**

This is one of my all time favorites.

A couple in their late 60's early 70's walk in the door and right off the bat I can see something is off. They just look a little confused...something's just different...I could tell. 

Me - How're y'all doing today (yeah southern drawl; I'd put it on for retail lol)? Can I help you with anything?

Confused couple (CC) - *Utter silence.*

Me (now confused myself) - Can I help you?

CC - *Still silent.*

At this point they began to sign to each other and I determined that they were both deaf. Well, that explains a lot. Found out that they were both INCREDIBLY proficient at reading lips (to the point where they warned me not to mutter anything negative under my breath as they'd probably pick that up too). We communicated via writing on slips of paper. They need a carpet cleaner. Ok, no problem; I write that I need  a drivers license and a credit card. They gladly provided me with both. Since they could read lips I would usually just ask them questions and they'd write.

Me - OK, I just need a home and a cell...phone...number... (I realized how ridiculous this was as I was asking for it...they were **DEAF** why would they have a phone?!?)

The man just looked at me with a stare that said ""what the fuck am I going to do with a phone?!?""

Me - Ummm...sorry...one sec.

I go straight to the owner who happened to be there that day (obviously he hadn't heard much if any of the one sided conversation I was having with CC). I explain the situation to the owner. At first he doesn't budge.

Owner - We need two phone numbers no matter what.

Me - Owner. They. Are. **DEAF**. They don't **HAVE** one phone between them, let alone two.

Owner - Yeah...I guess we've never had this come up before...ummm...Yeah...Uhhhh...just fill in the blanks with numbers.

Had anyone but the owner told me to do that I'd have told them to pound sand but that came from the tippity top and it was already an odd case so I punched it right in.

They didn't give us any trouble at all, returned it same day and everything went fine.

morgueanna,83,,63,17vu83,,387,"Here's one that just happened this past weekend from the other side of the counter.

Me and the boyfriend went to see some local pro hockey. I'm sure everyone here has been to a civic center or arena at some point and understands how busy concession booths can be, right?

Well, for us there's only one concession that serves a vegetarian option, so we hit that one up first. We're one of the first people to order so they don't have any veggie burgers made up yet and tell us it'll be a 10 minute wait. Not a problem, we step to the far right and wait for our food. A woman and her husband step behind us to wait a minute or two after us.

In just minutes, the concession is *swamped*. It went from less than a handful when we ordered to seven lines at least 15 people deep in moments. The concession workers are flying, filling drinks, grabbing popcorn, and also grabbing burgers off the heater area behind them as the grill crew makes them.

This apparently *will just not do* for the woman waiting behind us. She starts out slowly, muttering under her breath about how they have time to make the real meat burgers but not the veggies. As more and more people walk away with their food, she gets louder and more obnoxious, saying things like ""COME ON"" or ""JESUS CHRIST"" every time a worker walks by the counter at which we're waiting. Two times now the woman who took our order has ran past us with a harried smile, saying it would just be a few more moments. We were totally okay with that and honestly, good on her for keeping tabs in the middle of this chaos!

The self entitled twat behind me gets more and more agressive and finally drops this bomb- ""I can't fucking BELIEVE this. I paid BEFORE ALL these FUCKING PEOPLE and you told me it would be only TEN FUCKING MINUTES.""  At that point I look at our receipt: 5:07. Look at my phone: 5:15. And this lady ordered *after* we did. She's freaking out and just admitted they told her the time, and it's only been 8 minutes!

The grill cook brings out our order- two veggie burgers and two fries. I know it's our order because he called the number, and the impatient hosebeast, who has been waiting on one hotdog and one veggie burger, actually tries to *reach over me and take one of our burgers off the fucking tray*. To make it even more absurd, there was an employee behind him *holding* another tray, on which was a hotdog, so I can only assume her order was LITERALLY a few seconds away.

At this point I'd had enough- I hipchecked the counter, cutting off her stubby arm from our food and I said to the cook, loud enough for all the concession workers to hear, "" These look *amazing* and THANK YOU for making them fresh, which is so hard to come by at a concession stand. And in only 8 MINUTES TOO, which is LESS TIME than what you SAID IT WOULD TAKE. Thank you SO MUCH and I hope *other customers* learn to tell time so they'll know how FAST and EFFICIENT you really are."" With that, I spun on my heel, shouldered my way through the scowling woman and her cowed husband, and headed for the condiments where my boyfriend was waiting.

This cop comes up, flashes his badge, and says he's here to meet his daughter for a movie. Now, I wasn't sure if we had a policy where police or emergency personnel see movies for free, so I just let him go. Manager walks up, and I ask him. He tells me, ""Absolutely not.

serophia,60,,73,19mayn,,388,"Long time reader, first time poster. I have stories beyond number of my time in retail but this one will always stand out as the most absurd to me. This was many years ago, so I may not remember the dialogue word for word, but I don't think I'll ever forget any of the other details. 

I was 18 years old, fresh out of high school, and working part-time at a Shack that sold electronics. We were paid by commission at the time, with additional bonuses for certain items (like cellphones for example). Any large sale was always very exciting for us, but we never tried to sell a customer something he didn't need or want, since having it returned would have the same commission money coming out of our next paycheck.

One day I was helping a rather heavy set middle-aged man purchase a TV. It was a display, the last one we had of its model. We had a policy where instead of giving a discount on a display item, we would double the manufacturer's warranty up to one additional year. This guy was happy with that, and got to play with the TV to make sure it worked properly and everything. He even bought two cellphones while he was there, one for him and one for his wife. He complimented me on my service and left happy.

Fast forward a week or two later and I see the same guy come into the store, so I step up to see what else I can help him with. Turns out that was a mistake, because he was angry as hell. Started ranting about how the ""piece of shit TV"" I sold him was defective because it took a couple seconds for the display to power up when he turned it on. He demanded to know what I was going to do about it. Always happy to help, I said I didn't honestly remember if it was doing that or not when it was in our store, but if he's unhappy with the way it's working, we could either:

* a) send it to our repair center to have it fixed

 or
* b) take it back and give him his money back

But either way, he needed to bring the TV back to the store. He said that neither of the options I offered were good enough, and there was no way he was going to go through the trouble of bringing ""that piece of shit TV"" back in, and he wanted to know what I was going to do for him.

I was completely dumbfounded. I repeated what I said earlier, thinking maybe he misunderstood. Either solution seemed acceptable to me, but he disagreed and insisted I do something else because he just wasn't going to bring the TV in. We went back and forth like this for a couple minutes because I just couldn't comprehend what else he wanted me to do. When I flat out asked him he said ""What I want is for you to do your fucking job!""

Just when I thought that the situation couldn't get any more absurd, he then asked if I wanted to ""step out into the parking lot and settle this."" That's when a co-worker that was listening near by stepped in and told the guy flat out that he didn't care what his problem was, that was unacceptable and he needed to leave, now.

The customer started yelling even louder, said ""Fine then, I want to return THIS!"" and pulled his cellphone (that I sold him) out of his pocket and SLAMMED it down on the counter. The screen immediately shattered and bits of the case broke off and flew everywhere. Without thinking, I said the first thing that popped into my mind: ""We can't return that, it's broken."" (We couldn't have taken it back no matter what, once it was activated he had to deal with the cellphone service provider and not us. But the situation was so absurd that I said it without thinking).

He picked up the mangled phone and threw it against the wall where it exploded into tiny pieces. Then he turned on his heel and stomped out of the store without another word.

I was still so shocked by the encounter that I had to go sit down in the back, but once I calmed down I found the whole thing hilarious. To this day I still wonder if he really thought that a tiny 18 year old girl was going to fight him in the parking lot over his stupid TV.

A couple days later we got a call from the corporate headquarters saying they had a customer complaint about one of our associates stealing his phone. My manager said that we had his phone in a plastic bag here at the store and the customer was welcome to come pick it up whenever he wanted.

He never did.

notanangel_25,44,,64,1rehs5,,383,"Hi TFR!  My first post as I've recently started at a big box electronics retailer for the holidays.  I'm no stranger to retail though as this will be my 3rd Black Friday, one year at a department store and the other at a toy store that went out of business.

Just a quick story about a customer from yesterday.  My department is right near the DVDs and we don't have any dedicated staff manning the DVD section so obviously if someone asks for help finding something whoever would just help them.  Anyway, a woman asks for help looking for a DVD.  We'll call her Clueless Woman (CW).

*CW:  Hi I'm looking for a DVD.*

*Me:  Sure what's the name of it?*

*CW: The Counselor.*

*Me: Let's go.  It sounds familiar, how long ago did it come out?*

We get to the DVD section and I begin looking for the movie.

*CW: Oh the end of last month.*

I stop looking and turn to her, 

*""You mean it's still in theaters?*

*CW: Yea, probably, so do you have it in stock?*

*Me: Um, typically movies are in theaters for a few months, maybe 3 months or so.  So the earliest you could possibly see a DVD for a movie that came out a month ago would be February or March.*

*CW:  Could you just check in the back?*

*I directed her over to a computer where I searched the item and showed her it didn't exist yet.  She proceeds to ask me about a TV show which is in it's first season on TV right now.*

*CW: So I also want the DVD for this show called Betrayal on ABC.*  

*Me: Sure.*  

Since I'm at the computer, I look to see if we have it.

*Me:  I'm sorry nothing's coming up. How many seasons does it have so far?*

*CW:  Um, I think 1.*

I end up googling it and find out it's currently on TV.

*Me:  Well the show is currently being aired on TV so there would be no DVDs available until the show is done.*  

*CW:  When will that be?*

*Me:  Well it depends if their season goes a full season or a half season.  Again you're talking the earliest March-ish and more likely the Summer or Fall.*

*CW:  Oh ok.  Can I watch it online?*

*Me: Sure you can watch it on ABC.com, or Hulu.com*

*CW:  But I don't have a computer.*

*Me: Well depending on your tv provider, you can maybe watch it free ondemand.  Or if you can access the internet through your TV or other device...*

*CW: How would I do that?*

*Me: Do you have wifi at home?*

*CW: So that means my TV can just connect?!*

*Me: Um, about how old is your TV?*

*CW:  I've had that old TV for years.  It might be as old as you, haha.*

Me:  Then no, you can't connect to the internet unless you have a another device like a gaming console or dvd player.*

*CW:  So... maybe I should just buy a tablet so I can watch it right?*

*Me:  Umm, that's an option...if that's what you want...*

*CW:  And I'll be able to watch the Counselor on there too right?*

*Me:* ****facepalm****  *Ma'am the movie is still in theaters, no DVD is going to come out until next year.  Even then it will take awhile before you'd be able to watch it online.*

*CW:  It's fine.  So tell me about the Nexus iPads.*

*Me:...*

I go through the whole spiel of showing her the different tablets and then she stops me mid-sentence and asks the price of the tablet I was telling her about even though it was right there in front of it.

*Me:  Well this tablet is actually on sale right now for $359.*

*CW:  What!?  That's too much money just to watch this movie.*  

Then she just walks out of the store.","""I'm sorry, what you're looking for doesn't exist yet""",447,talesFromRetail
AnthraxyWaxy,82,,86,1q6hrx,,383,"The title is hyperbole, but this lady was pretty insane.  I worked for a large coffee chain inside of a grocery store, and the training there was horrible.  I was given about a week and a half of training, and then left on my own for whole 8 hour shifts without any help.  Also, I can't have caffeine, otherwise I get dizzy and nauseous.  This means that I had little experience with coffee drinks.

Naturally, my first day working on my own was a bit of a disaster.  Somehow, I had not yet learned that ""latte"" refers to the steamed milk, not to the espresso. 

Well, this one lady, who I'll name TB for Total Bitch, came up to the counter and asked for a Chai Latte.  I thought I had this one in the bag, and so, without looking it up, I make a Chai (*which has goddamned caffeine in it to begin with*) and add espresso.  All the while, this lady was pacing around, looking incredibly impatient.

I gave her the Chai, and told her to have a nice day.  She muttered a thank you, and then took a tiny little test sip.  She then proceeds to freak the fuck out.

TB:  ""OH MY GOD, DOES THIS HAVE COFFEE IN IT?!  QUICK, GET ME A GLASS OF WATER, OH GOD, I CAN'T HAVE CAFFEINE.  I'M ABOUT TO PASS OUT, OH MY GOD.""

Me (having a heart attack at this point):  ""Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!"" -quickly get her water, all the while apologizing profusely- ""I'm really, really sorry!  I'm new here, but I should have known better!  Here, let me remake and refund your drink, and I'll give you a coupon for a free drink next time you shop at our chain.  Again, I can't apologize enough!!""

TB:  ""THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  Get me your manager, NOW!""

Me:  ""Yes, ma'am, of course!""

I call up my manager and explain the situation to him, and he makes his way over, apparently taking *way* too long for this lady, who is huffing and puffing about.  She then yells at him for about five minutes about how incompetent and stupid I am, refuses to take another drink from me (but does take the refund and coupon), and goes back to shopping.

Later, still a bit shaken from my first ever crazy customer, and slowly realizing that that little sip of caffeine would never send *my* body in a spin, I see her just 15 feet away at self check-out.  She's yelling at her husband on the phone, because apparently the TV won't work and he can't fix it.   All the while, she is standing at a self-checkout kiosk and is obviously too angry to swipe her groceries.  The person manning the self-checkout area has to come over and swipe and bag her groceries for her.

She tells her husband she is going to call the cable company, and a few minutes later, I hear her yelling into the phone:  ""GET ME YOUR MANAGER ON THE PHONE, RIGHT NOW!""  

I broke down laughing, and learned that day that some people are just assholes.",This has caffeine!? OH GOD I'M GOING TO DIE.,469,talesFromRetail

AvadaK_Green,118,,80,1puhtm,,379,"So I have to say that I consider myself a person with a high amount of patience and tolerance for other people. I find that working in food service you have to have both of these things but today I was almost pushed past my limit.Where I work is a pretty up-and-coming little restaurant chain and we're always super busy, but it's  Sunday night and we're winding down. Today has been pretty hectic considering we are located near a very large university and today is normally our busiest day of the week. 
I was wiping down the drink station when a lady come up came up to me and said that we didn't have any more Diet Coke. I told her in a very polite manner that I would go to the back and check the syrup to see what was going on. As it would turn out, we didn't have any more syrup left in the bag and there was none left replace it with. So I went to tell her that we didn't have anymore left and this is how that exchange went(the lady will be know as EB):
Me: I'm sorry ma'am but it seems like we don't have any more syrup left for the Diet Coke.
EB: I only drink Diet Coke.
(And here I would like to point out that we have an abundant arrangement of Coke and Pepsi products, unsweet tea, sweet tea, Splenda sweetened tea, lemonade and coffee. )
Me: I'm sorry ma'am but once the syrup is gone there's nothing else I can do.
EB: Well there's a convenience store two minutes away and you can go get me a Diet Coke.
(Insert shocked shitless face here.)
Me: i'm sorry ma'am but I'm not allowed to leave the premises while I'm on the clock.
EB: BUT I ONLY DRINK DIET COKE!
Me: Let me go get my manager. 
EB: I want a refund for this whole meal. I just can't eat my salad without something to drink. 
As far as I know my manager ended up giving her an entire refund for the meal. And afterwords she demanded that we make her a new salad to go so that she could eat her salad at home with a Diet Coke.

techiebabe,87,,113,1prkmw,,385,"Needed to let off steam and where better than TFR where you share my frustrations?

It was Saturday afternoon at a large supermarket. I had finished my shopping and was trying to drive out of the car park.

A woman was pushing her trolley slowly down the road within the car park. Straddling the white line, so she was blocking both lanes and couldnt easily be passed. Never mind... I just stayed in my lane and hung back, giving her space, inching forward at her slow ambling pace. 

Eventually she looked over her shoulder and noticed me. She turned round and screeched at me, a tirade which I didnt entirely catch but the gist of which was 'what the hell are you doing?' 

I instinctively replied 'Im driving'.

She moved over to one side to shout at me through my driver's window, which gave me the space to pull away &amp; drive off.

But honestly? What was I doing? Giving you space and time to move, even though you were ignoring the pavements, and if you chose one side of the road OR the other, thered be room for both of us. 

I hope she hasnt got kids, it would be awful for them to hear her high pitched irrational head-biting rants. At least I could tell myself that for whatever reason, I was having a better day than her at this point!

Stabbies,36,,77,1mbnml,,385,"I don't work in retail, but you guys seem lenient about that type of thing and there isn't a shipping/receiving subreddit... So I'll just post this here. Let me know if that's against the rules, and I'll delete it.

So, I work in shipping/receiving for a massive company in a large city. We would receive dozens of boxes over the course of each day, and all of them would be signed for, loaded, and delivered to their recipients by me. I also handled outgoing mail and boxes, but that's irrelevant to the story.

My company shares a a building with a few other companies, all of them much smaller than mine. Regardless, they all had their own shipping and receiving people. Despite being in the same building, each business had a separate address, so it's rare that something gets sent to the wrong place. But it does happen.

I received a large, heavy box one day. It had my company address on it, but the name on the box was someone who worked at another company in the building, and that company name was also on the box. Let's call this company G. As per protocol, I called the shipping/receiving desk for G, told them I had a box for them, and asked them to come sign for it.

The shipping guy at G told me that he didn't want to come get it, I needed to deliver it to him, and he sure as hell wasn't going to sign for his own fucking box.

This a problem, because my company protocol clearly states that once I've signed for a box with a shipping company, I CAN NOT let that box leave my possession without a signature from the receiver. Whether this box went to someone in my company or not, I was liable for whatever happened to it until I had a signature for it.

Asshat working at G, even after hearing my explanation, refuses to sign.

So I wrote ""not at this address"" on the box and sent it out via outgoing boxes that night. 

I got it back a few days later. I assume that the receiver just thinks that the building address is his company address. The shipping guy at G still wouldn't sign for it, so I sent it out again, once again labelled ""Not at this address.""

I got it back, again, a few days later.

So I've been receiving, and shipping, this box over and over for about three weeks now. I don't really have a choice in the matter, but the Fedex guy and I have been having a laugh over it. The box is starting to look like someone tried to put it through a paper shredder. 

The shipping and receiving guy at G has become increasingly furious at me for not just giving him the box, but there's nothing I can do about it. (The entire building is keycard restricted, I can't deliver the box to the receiver myself because I don't have access to G company floors.) I don't know what's in the box, and there's no way in hell I'm breaking protocol because this guy is too lazy to sign his fucking name on the dotted line. Apparently he has the receiver breathing down his neck, because according to the tracking number, the box has been received, sent back, received, and sent back, repeatedly. He's been called repeatedly by the sender to confirm his name, company name, and address before the box is sent back each time. I'm curious about how many hundreds of dollars went into shipping this box back and fourth for almost a month. The poor receiver has been waiting on whatever the hell is in this box for three weeks longer than necessary.


Eventually I called the company contact that's been sending the box back, explained it to him, and he said he'd fix the label the next time he got the box. 

I never saw that box again, but I still hate the shipping guy who works at G.",In which a large box is sent and received dozens of time because an employee refuses to sign for it.,462,talesFromRetail
Bravesfan417,33,,82,1lsrqu,,380,"This is my favorite story of all time. It can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1mox95/sweet_little_old_ladies_are_the_best_customers/)

Hi everybody! This is my first time posting to this sub, I actually just found it last night and couldn't wait to spill the beans on my boss, but wanted to sleep on it so that I could remember all of the stories that I could.

A little background on me. I was hired the summer right after I graduated high school to start in a grocery store. I was hired as a checker/stocker to start out with, and how very quickly that changed.

Anyways, boss seems insanely nice during the interview and telling me that I was hired. I thought, ""Great! I have a nice boss to work for! This'll be fun!"" Oh how naive I was...

Story 1: I always had Tues/Thurs off for school, and usually one other day during the week, mostly on Wednesday. I come back to work on Friday as an opening checker, I'm met at the door by my red-faced, highly irate boss (this was towards the end of my stint at this store). He goes off on me about how something wasn't done in the deli right on Thursday. I inform him that I was at school, and even though I was trained in the bakery/deli, I wasn't at the store to screw something up. He proceeds to blame it all on me, saying that I should have ""known it would happen and showed up to prevent it."" I was flabbergasted, but just walked away and went on with my work.

Story 2: The day before Thanksgiving in 2012, our store was a madhouse. We had 6 cashiers, but only 4 lanes. I was there to be a checker/carry-out/cart-fetcher for the day. There's a small lull in the action, and our bookkeeper/front end manager asks me if I will run to the bank with her to get change since the bank won't be open again until Monday, and she was in her 50's and I wasn't going to make her carry it all herself. We go to the bank, and I end up carrying something along the lines of 60-70 lbs of change inside. After being back at the store for 2 minutes, the asst. manager calls me behind the service desk and hands me a write up for ""not retrieving carts from the parking lot"". Before we left, I had gathered all the carts and ran them back inside. During the 15 minutes we were gone, I guess a massive rush showed up and cleared out the carts, and people left them in the parking lot. Even with 3 other people there to gather carts, I was the one written up. I signed it just because I needed to help somebody with a western union.

Story 3: I was changing light bulbs in the store with the help of a stocker to hand me the bulbs (the long fluorescent ones). My boss shows up, yells at the stocker to go do something productive, and then yells at me for doing what I am. I inform that he told me to do it first chance I had after I arrived that morning. He gives me a ""you're annoying me"" sigh, walking off and bumping the ladder I was standing on. Hard. I fall off, twist my ankle, and bust 2 light bulbs. My boss tells me to clean it up, and when I'm done, there's a write-up slip for me to sign. I refuse. He threatens to fire me. I threaten a law-suit, he shuts up.

Story 4: My buddy was getting married, and I was in the wedding, and we were going on a float trip for the bachelor party. I asked to leave early on Thursday, and have Friday off, and to leave at noon on Saturday the day of the wedding. I ask about 3 months in advance, he calls me in about 5 days before the bachelor party and tells me that I can't have any of the days off because I didn't give him enough notice. I figure ""Ok, I can deal with not making the bachelor party although it'll suck, but I'm in the wedding."" I inform him that I'm in the wedding, and that I can come in a different day to make up the hours if he wants me to. He tells me, ""You can't go because I'm your boss and I said so."" I inform him that I'm going to the wedding, and whatever consequences I face, I'll deal with later. I miss the bachelor party, and Saturday rolls around. When I walk in, he asks if I can receive a shipment for him at 1.30, I tell him that I'm leaving at 12 for the wedding, and he says that if I leave, then I won't have a job the next day. I walk away, and leave at 12. I walk in the next day and still have my job.

Story 5: I was facing (zoning) the toilet paper aisle one day because I was just a stocker that day, and I got everything out that needed to be out. I ran out right before he went to lunch to get carts, and did again about 10 minutes before he got back. I'm standing on a milk crate to reach the very back of the shelf to reach something, when all of a sudden my boss comes around the corner and kicks the milk crate out from underneath me. I fall, taking out half the shelf with me, stand up and ask him ""What the fuck was that for??"" He tells me that I didn't get the carts and he had to get them after his lunch and it wasn't his job (he brought in 2 damn carts... I watched the video). I tell him that he can pick the toilet paper up himself, and that I'm going to lunch. I come back an hour later, and I see our office manager/front end manager (our sweet 50 year old lady from earlier) picking up the toilet paper. I ask her why, and she said that ""Mike"" our boss, had told her she had to. I tell her that I'll take care of it. I grab all the toilet paper that I can (while still leaving a respectable amount for the customers) and go and stack it in his office. He threw a bitch fit when he got back and wrote me up. I refused again.

Story 6: I had placed my 2 week notice in, and I had 2 days left. He's pissed I'm leaving because I trained all the new checkers, and I was the only person he had up front who could run the whole service desk beside our sweet 50yo office manager. He takes me in to his office, and tells me that he wants me to stay. I told him that I'd had enough of his crap, I fould a better job with better pay, running the warehouse of a competitive grocery store, and I had a few friends that I knew work there. He tells me that he'll tell the new store that I'm a horrible employee. I let him know that he talked to our office manager and got a great recommendation from her for me. He calls her in the office and attempts to rip her a new one, and she's had enough ""Mike, you leave this poor boy alone! He's done everything that you've asked him to do, and he's getting out of here! You're an asshole and if you even attempt to write me or him up, I'll quit and you'll have to do the books yourself or hire someone else!"" (He isn't capable of doing the books). He tells her to leave and then proceeds to start ripping me a new one. I walk out and go back to my register and start ringing up a new customer. He comes over the intercom 3 times with variations of ""Bravesfan417, come to the office now!"" I refuse. He walks out and stands outside his office and yells in front of customers, employees, and everybody in that store, ""Bravesfan417, get your fucking ass in this office right now you piece of shit!"" Everybody in the store looks at me as I calmly reply ""I've got 2 days left, what're you gonna do, fire me?"" He storms back in the office, I receive applause. It was awesome.


ACTUAL GOOD STORY FOR ONCE

Story 7: I was bringing carts inside and I almost hit some older lady who was walking out while I was walking in. I said, ""Oops! Didn't mean to almost run you over! I'm sorry!"" Her husband stands there and says, ""I've been trying to run her ass over for years now..."" And I just lost it laughing. She hits him with her purse and calls him an asshole in a joking manner and they walked out holding hands.


**TL;DR** Old boss was a complete jerk, and 1 cute story at the end.

Note: Sorry this is so long, but I had a few stories to share! And also, all names used are not the employees actual names.

**EDIT** Since this thread blew up, I'll add a few other things. Since so many people have told me to do so, I went ahead and contacted corporate and HR. The statue of limitations for battery in my state is 2 years, so I will talk to somebody about it. Although since I'm 5 hours away at college, I will more than likely just back up what the other charges have said, or if he plans on pleading guilty to them, then I will throw mine into the mix to add to his misery.

As to why I never laid a hand on him, first, I'm a 5'10"" guy, and weigh roughly 140 lbs, whereas my boss was near 6'4"", and weighed about 275. I also thought about anything that could have legally happened to me had I done anything, and didn't want to deal with the hassle. Even though I never foresaw taking him to court, I can definitely say now that refraining from hitting him is going to help.

And as to why I stayed, another poster had said it. I was just out of high school and stupid. My family is quite well off so what I made was completely mine (minus gas, car insurance, car payment, phone payment), and I tend to spend quite a bit of money, and I didn't want to do anything to threaten my job, or quit until I had something else lined up.

SaintBernards,47,,78,1lnd13,,388,"The restaurant I work at has always, and forever will be, closed on Mondays. Every Monday, a few managers are there for a few hours, taking inventory, doing payroll, accepting deliveries, etc.

I was there yesterday with a few other people. We were waiting for one more delivery truck. It was Labor Day, and even though we were closed, many, many people tried coming in. 

The final truck arrived and we let the driver in while writing him a check and looking over the invoice. We locked the door behind him. As he was leaving, a group of 3 (two guys, one girl, late 20's) were trying to walk up. They saw we were closed, tried pulling on the door, then started banging on it while yelling ""Hello? Are you open???!!!""

We let them figure it out and eventually they left, or so we thought. The driver unlocked the door to leave and as he was walking through the door, the 3 pretty much barreled him over to get in.

They all stood in the lobby, looking so smug and happy. Like they just beat the system, or something. *""Oh yea, we totally just got into this closed restaurant, now they **HAVE** to serve us, hahahahahaha!""*

nanabattmaaaannnnn,128,,102,1f7hp9,,381,"Alright, this is my first time posting on here, so bear with me as far as formatting and such. 

I used to work for a major retail company . I worked in the Electronics Department and was one of our top performing employees. All of our guest scores had risen significantly since transferring to this store, and I was also a very well rounded employee. I worked not only within electronics, but any other department I was needed, including logistics and guest service. 

There was a Spanish teacher at a nearby high school who was nice enough to assign a video project in which these groups of HS students had to film a short ad, in spanish, in the specific store I worked. 
The problem is we do not allow video recording within the store without permission from the store and district manager, as well as a film permit. 

A group of high school girls and their overenthusiastic mother come into electronics and begin filming right in the middle of the main aisle, complete with other customers. I go up to them and calmly, and extremely nicely explain that they can not record within the store without a permit. Before I even have a chance to say anything more, the lady loses it. and by loses it, I mean she flips her shit. Starts berating me and my ""job"" saying that I work minimum wage and need to shut the hell up and let them do their assignment and get the hell out of their way. I ask her to please remain calm, that I would be more than willing to bring the manager over, but that she could not continue filming, especially if there are other customers in the video against their will. I think I honestly said something along the lines of if she posts this on youtube, the unsuspecting customers have every right to sue her to the full extent of the law... maybe not 100% true, but I was losing patience. 

So the manager, Derptina, comes over. She asks whats wrong and replies with ""Oh sure, go ahead and film! Have a great day!!""

Ok. This pisses me off. I'm a former film student, I know how much trouble our store, as well as my manager can now get in. I try explaining that to her, but she won't listen, so I make her move me to another department if there is going to be filming within electronics. 


flash forward to the next day. 
group of teenage boys comes in to film, I tell them they are more than welcome to go speak with a manager, but until they have her permission, they are not allowed to film. 
The lead guy of the group starts cussing at me, calling me every name in the book, and before I have a chance to snap and tear him a new one, I tell him to leave my dept until a manager gets there. 

I call Derptina back to the dept. ""Derptina, Could you please come to electronics? I have a verbally abusive guest, and need assitance before he turns violent."" 

her response: ""Sorry, I'm actually eating right now, so it's going to be at least 20 minutes before I can get over there.""

key words. Verbally abusive. violent. REALLLY? 

Then as soon as Derptina comes back she pulls me off the floor and proceeds to try and coach me. She says I did not handle the situation according to policy. I tried explaining to her what happened and reminded her that she was supposed to come to the dept, or at least send an AP guy over.
Needless to say, Derptina is seriously trying to blame me for the guy blowing up on me, despite the numerous other employees who have told her that I did nothing wrong. 
She then starts blaming me for the .01% drop in guest service, and all of the other problems within the dept. (that I had actually fixed.)

So, in a moment of lack of judgement, in a job I didn't really need, I did what I had wanted to do in every other retail job at some point or another, and told her to, and I quote ""Take this job and shove it""

FilmYak,97,,129,1bt3cm,,385,"I was picking up some meds from the local pharmacy, and had my three year old son with me. The woman handling the register started asking him if he had any brothers or sisters. He said no, and she started on with, ""you have to tell your mommy and daddy to give you a brother or sister..."" Yammering on for a minute about this, ignoring my wide eyed appeals for her to shut her pie hole, eventually telling me directly I needed to give him a sibling. 

It was very hard work on my end not to chew her out and punch her in the face. 

See, we had already told our son a few months earlier that he was going to have a sibling, and then my wife miscarried. 

Now, the idiot at the register didn't know that, and in her head I'm sure she was being nice, but she couldn't have pressed a more damaging button if she'd tried. 

All she had to do was keep her mouth shut, and I hope any retailers reading this -- screw it, I hope any decent people reading this -- learn that sometimes they need to stop as soon as, ""no, I don't have any siblings"" has been established. 

(Ps - after 2 miscarriages we did end up with a healthy second kid. Just adding this because I am not asking for sympathy votes, I'm just asking for people to be aware before they tell a compete stranger they need to have more kids.)

Edit: thanks everyone for the kind words, but seriously, it's ok.  Both miscarriages were at around ""first heartbeat"" time and my wife and I were both approaching 40, so as much as it sucked, we were relatively prepared for it.  And again, we did have a 2nd child eventually and he's just months away from turning 3.  We are all well, it was just a frustrating story that stands out because it was so --- well, she was TRYING to be cheerful while talking to a cute little boy, she clearly had no clue it was a stupid thing to say and continue talking about, but boy it pissed me off.

Edit2: several folks have asked if I'm sure it was a pharmacist, not a cashier.  I am not sure.  I just know she was working behind the pharmacy counter, and I'm using that term for the sake of simplicity.

toxicpretty,28,,79,1a3vgj,,383,"I had a similar experience when I worked as a makeup consultant for a small chain of  boutique makeup stores. We worked in a mall and gave free ""mini makeovers"" for customers in order to get them interested in our products. I worked along side a more senior associate who had quite the attitude. She made it a point to only target people who looked liked they had money to burn...she'd leave the rest to me. I didn't care cause it was just fun making people look their best...I loved showing people how to create a beautiful look for themselves and I actually like most of our products so it was easy to recommend them. 

One day a couple of little girls came in to ask for makeovers. Because they looked about twelve, the older associate quickly brushed them off saying they needed to ""go play"". We were slow as hell and they looked so eager...I immediately said that I would love to help them. The senior associate reminded me that I was wasting company time and resources on children and that their mom was going to be pissed as hell. But I figured that it was just for fun and, besides, I could show them how to make it look natural and simple. Maybe even help them avoid the god awful self-taught looks that little girls usually do. 

So I sit the first one down and start to cleanse. Immediately I realize that despite being an exceptionally beautiful little girl, she's sporting a serious cleft lip scar. She tells me that she's always hated it...and asks if I know how to diminish it. I tell her that she's in luck since I know some theater makeup tricks I learned in high school (not to mention I'm a painter). Long story short...I give both girls a killer natural look but most importantly, I completely hide the cleft lip . Gone. The look of utter adoration and joy was worth a dozen sales and I sent them off feeling pretty satisfied.

I thought that was the end of the story but I was wrong. A half hour goes by and suddenly a woman rushes in demanding to know who gave a makeover to her daughter. I immediately recognize the little girl with the cleft lip  trailing behind her. The senior consultant smiles and points to me...thinking I'm about to get a major chewing out. But instead I am immediately hugged. There are tears and laughs as the mother urgently explains that I'm a miracle worker and that her daughter has never looked so beautiful. She then goes on to tell me that her daughter is a steady pageant contestant who has racked up many a trophy despite the cleft lip ...but now she NEEDS me to teach her how to fix the scar. Fast forward...twenty hugs and a professional makeup consultation is scheduled. This is a 75 dollar service we offer for people wanting a full, specialized consultation, facial cleansing, and makeup application. I want to add at this point that I worked on a base pay/commission status...making a small bonus for each item I sell along with my hourly rate. The  professional consultation comes with a nice commission.

The senior consultant was shocked and then grumpy at this turn of events but wrote it off as lucky but unlikely to lead to any major sales due to the girls age.
Oh how wrong she was...
Three days later, at the scheduled time, three people showed up instead of two... The little girl, her mom, and her dad. There is a weird feeling in the air...not bad, just weird. It doesn't take long to realize that the couple is divorced, civil, and madly in love with their daughter. But there is some tension and some emotional ""issues"". It seems that dad's paying and mom is consciously/unconsciously using that to drive up the purchases. She's treating me like a makeup guru and every time I even touch a product, it's purchased. It was like something out of a game show shopping spree...with the piles of makeup up and cleansers building a metropolis at the register. I'm having candid camera moments, pinching myself occasionally to see if this is real. But I'm drawing the boundaries when suddenly I realize that it's going too far...after she began asking about whether we should add anti-wrinkle and cellulite creams(some of our most expensive and, IMO, useless product), I put the brakes on. I never let people buy those. She's twelve (I knew they were going to the mom) and besides, I told her, they don't work anyway. By this time they had bought nearly one of everything in the store with the dad seemingly unfazed and the mom and girl giddy as can be. It was the most fun I'd had in the month I'd worked there (oh yeah...did I mention that?). And then it was over to the tune of nearly $600 not including the makeover. Plus many hugs, compliments, and teary giggles.

My senior consultant had unfortunately not been scheduled to witness the crazy spree but was there the next day when my manager came in on his day off to award me an additional bonus and certificate for best individual sale to date. I guess I had broken a previously held record by nearly a hundred dollars!
The look on the Sr.consultant was priceless...almost better than the hugs and money...almost, but not quite! So much for working with lowly kids, eh?

Story of the Flying Vacuum!

I was roughly 5 months into my new job at Circuit City. They used to sell vacuums but not since I had been there. In walks a very pissed guy, (wife beater and faux gold chains kind) carrying his new looking vacuum like he was carrying a bundle wood. 

Mini Hulk: ""This fucking thing does work!"" 

Me: ""Ok, what is it doing??""

Mini Hulk:  ""The fucking thing doesn't work!"" (he is almost angry that I asked another question) 

How so? (further angers him)

Mini Hulk ""IT DOESN'T SUCK SHIT UP!!!"" now my manager hears this and comes out of the office. 

Manager: ""Hi, how can I help you?""

Mini Hulk: ""THIS FUCKING VACUUM DOESN'T WORK!"" loud enough the whole store can hear this.

I take a step back and let my manager do the talking.... After a back and forth, with a vein popping out on his forehead, he doesn't have a receipt, doesn't know who bought it or when, we can't even determine that it was bought at Circuit City. 

Manager: ""Ok so what do you want us to do here? We can send it off to services and they can take a look but that will take a couple weeks....."" (right about this point, Mini Hulk boils over)

Mini Hulk: ""FUCK YOU GUYS YOU CAN KEEP THIS PIECE OF SHIT!!!!

He picks up the vacuum and tosses it over the counter like a javelin, I side step and my manager ducks the incoming cleaner. Shit hits the wall loudly and now the whole store is watching this event. Managers come pouring out the office seeing what is going on. Mini Hulk storms out the building, dislodging our automatic doors and almost breaking one. 

Me and my manager stare at each other for a while trying to sort what just happened. The video replay of this is funny as hell, we saved a tape just for posterity. Everything calms down, we have a good laugh. About an hour later, we get curious about our newly acquired vacuum. We are looking at the bottom, brush spins, still works. But he was right, it wasn't sucking. We pull it open (some of you know where this is going)......

The bag inside was solid and I mean like a paper brick worth of dust and shit. It weighed several pounds. *They had never changed the bag out of the vacuum...* I look dumbfounded at my manager and our warehouse guy as we all just laugh hysterically when it dawns on me, the K-Mart next store probably has the bags to fit this. So I run next door almost giddy and sure enough they do. I buy a pack and take it next door. The damn thing works great!

My co-worker had been looking through our search history and found a last name, different first, different phone number, etc, that purchased this model around the same time. Guess what the serial numbers match! I decide to make a call... well because we were being so smug. 

Phone: Hello?

Me Hi is this Mr. Hulk??

Phone: Yes this is him...

Me: Hi, this is (Me) at Circuit City, I just wanted to let you know we figured out that vacuum!

Phone: ... What vacuum???

Me: Ummm, the one that was thrown?? 

Phone: ??? When????

Me: Today, (I then recount the story of the flying vacuum) 

Turns out, this is Hulk Senior. It was his vacuum that we had fixed and Mini Hulk was his son being a douche. We gladly invite him back to the store to retrieve his vacuum. :)

15 minutes later in walks Hulk Sr with Mini Hulk in tow, tail between his legs and head hung low. Hulk Sr makes Mini Hulk look like a small child in size...and he is PISSED. 

We pull the vacuum out, show them it working on a demo mat. We open it up and show how to take the bags out and replace. Shit we even gave them the bags we bought! We let Mini Hulk try it out as his dad watched glaringly. We are being so damn chipper but Mini Hulk never looks us in the face. We also showed the bag we removed. You could almost here Mini Hulk shrink three sizes as his Hulk Sr. slowly looks over at him like ""You fucking idiot..."" We shake Hulk Sr.'s hand with a smile on our face and Mini Hulk clutches his working vacuum like a small child as he leaves the store. 

It was glorious.  ",Mini Hulk and the peculiar case of the flying vacuum!,464,talesFromRetail

Asshole: I need tickets to [EVENT] but I need THE BEST SEATS.

Me (*inward sigh*): All right, ma'am, I have a group of four downstairs in the center section; they're about a third of the way back, right in the middle, so you should have a lovely view.

Asshole: NO! I need the BEST seats!

Me: These are actually very good seats, ma'am. As I said, they're less than halfway back, and they're right in the center. 

Asshole: No, you're trying to trick me. I know there's a pillar there!

Me: ....that venue has no pillars, ma'am. I assure you that these are the best possible seats, unless you prefer to be upstairs.

Me: These are the best seats.

Asshole: Aren't you going to offer me anything else?

Me: As I said, this event is very full, and your group is large. I can put you much further back, and much further to the side, but I will not be able to put you in the center anywhere else. 

Asshole: FINE. But you're sure those are the *best* seats?

Me: Yes, actually, those are some of the best seats in that theater. Normally their director puts his VIPs in those seats. 

Asshole: I don't know. Those sound *awfully* far back.

Me: It is a very small venue, and those seats are less than halfway back. You will have a fine view.

SilentDis,57,,91,1mjzo8,,379,"This will be a long one.  No apologies, no regrets.  My mind drifts back to these times today because of a post on another subreddit.

This took place in ye grande olde tymes of 2000.  I was 21 years old, and found myself the owner and primary operator of a burger and fries restaurant.

My father 'started' it.  He took a run-down carhop only (drive-up, order at a speaker or with a person, food is brought out to your car) A&amp;W and reopened without the corporate branding as an independent.  He was quite successful; and decided to upgrade to a small sit-down place.

New slab attached to what used to be a kitchen in 4 walls, seating for about 25 (35 if the fire marshal wasn't around!), couple washrooms, and a slight upgrade to the kitchen (hanging outlets, everything on wheels, etc.).  I helped 'design' the kitchen a little, after having some experience in fast food when I was in High School.  He ran it as such for about a month and a half... and got bored of it.  Nothing 'wrong' or anything, just wanted to do something else.

I had 'lent' him $10,000 as a silent partner (eBay sniping and re-listing, computer builds, a couple other odd interests here and there while holding a tech support job).  It was a business venture, plain and simple; he got extra funding, I got a couple grand a year till I hit $20k out was the original idea.  Between his boredom and me getting fed up with tech support though, he offered it to me... while he'd go silent partner.  I had nothing really to lose, so I said sure.

Location was good.  I was 1/4 mile from a state bike trail that was popular.  I had a High School out my front door and the kids had open campus for lunch.  The prices at the 2 fast food franchise joints were a bit high, and the only other place to eat were, for the most part, bars where they couldn't go anyway.

I 'cleaned house' rather quickly.  He was a bit 'old mind' on a lot of things.  His product was mostly pre-packed frozen, and his supplier was gouging him badly for the privilege.  In 2 months, I had re-invented the menu to be much, much smaller.  I fired the two idiots he had because they were lazy.  I introduced a 'waste control' (i.e. fresh soup daily!, daily specials!), and purchased some new equipment (a flat top that catches fire if you put a burger too close to the edge isn't good, dad).

I hired a cook.  This kid was 20, and looked (and was, when I hired him) a total wreck.  A rap sheet in a small, rural town in the middle of Wisconsin that included numerous drug offences, theft, and the big one, grand theft auto (a bit bullshit, that one.  A test drive from a used car dealership that went a little... awry).  To this day, I have no fucking idea what went through my head when I hired him... but folks, impressions are not everything.  He really wanted to turn his life around, and I am very, very honored and proud that he got a damn good start at it while working for me.  I also hired only 2 'teeny-boppers'.  Specifically, kids from the High School to work my front-of-house.

Minimum wage at that time was all of $5.15/hr.  This is entry-level bullshit.  That's what I should pay, right?  No.  Just... no.  My cook got $9/hr start (at the end, he was making $12/hr).  The two kids I hired to wipe tables, take money, and make shakes?  Yeah, they got $7/hr and instant $0.50/hr raise after 2 weeks.  I was told, multiple times, that I was insane for doing such a thing.

Wrong.  Way wrong.  I admit, there was a lot of hire-and-fire for a while.  If you didn't work, you were out on your ass without a second glance.  But I had a stack of applications in my office a mile high.  Every kid in the high school wanted to make that sweet, sweet bank... and the fast food joints (the only other places they could get jobs) were stuck on the whole 'must pay minimum wage' mentality.

My interview process kicked a lot of them to the curb.  It wasn't the 'sit down and answer questions' variety.  I'd pull down a 15-20lb box of plastic spoons off my high shelf and tell them to put it back.  Lift a full mop bucket into the mop sink properly, with your legs not your back.  You'd be surprised how often these simple, physical tasks were either scoffed at, or *couldn't be completed*.  It was on the application.  You said you could do that.  Why did you start right off by lying to me?

The big one, though, was making change in your head.  I ***required*** every person to touch my till to be able to do basic change in their heads.  I didn't care that the register told them; mistakes happen and I want their double-check.  When the bill is $3.26 and the customer hands you a $5, you should be able to tell them the change is $1.74 *instantly*.  When they failed, and so many did, that this is 4th grade arithmetic at best, and they're in high school, I got some tears, some attitude... but I never, ever gave them a job.

When I did hire, I made sure they understood, up front, what it was 'we do here'.  Simply, this building, and your job, exist to make me filthy rich.  So wealthy, in fact, that I would be able to go home and swim in a pool of money, just like Scrooge McDuck.  Everything we did here would be actions toward that one, single goal.  Now, I am happy to take you along with me, provided we're in it together.  Deal?

I made sure they understood that this was a more 'business partner' deal than just a joe-job.  It was my life, after all.  I paid well at the onset, and you're damn right I gave regular raises.  One kid was making $10.50/hr before she went and moved out of state for college.  Another was making $9.  For a 16 year old, 13 years ago... that was pretty damn good.  I may have expected a lot, but the way I saw it, I better pay for that just as well.

Also, no one, and I mean no one, abused my staff but me ;).  I am a sarcastic, sardonic, self-deprecating prick, and proud of it.  Given the unlimited power granted to me by ownership, there were times when I'd crank it to 11 and rip off the knob.  I'd joke around with 'abusing' my staff and fully expect them to give it back in spades.  I assure you, I herd some great one-liners at my expense; high schoolers are wonderfully cruel :)

I tried very, very hard to make a safe, fun, decent place for both me, and my employees to make money at.  I like to think I succeeded in that, at least.

There's... one other thing, I must remind you all of.  I had dedicated a good 70-80 hours a week to this place, myself.  From the behind the scenes stuff (running errands, doing bookwork, filling out tax forms, filing tax forms, preparing orders, picking up orders, tearing my Sysco rep a new asshole because the product I was sent was shit [more on that at a later time]), to general maintenance (toilet clogs, repairing a table leg, re-attaching trim to my coolers, fixing broken equipment), as well as being there, constantly, to cook, clean, help staff, train staff, serve customers... Everything.  I saw it this way; if I didn't do the job, in front of my staff, how the hell could I expect them to do it right (my way)?  Mind you, I didn't 'work' a moment of it; I ***lived for this***.

With all that out of the way, I'll share a few short moments that stick out that always make me smile.

-----

My 'meal deals' were just a sandwich and fries.  No drink.  This was intentional; it encouraged upsales to more profitable items like shakes, malts, phosphates, etc.  I didn't make squat on sodas... well, compared to my profits on a root beer float, I didn't.  Still, can't beat a single, hand-pattied, fresh-never-frozen, burger on a fresh-made-that-day bun, with hand-cut fries for $2.85 plus tax.

Still, idiots would complain... and demand a free drink.  I would try to educate a few, at first... it was like telling a toddler they can't have more candy; a pointless activity that just drained me.  I told my kids to just tell them no, politely, and ask if they'd like to buy one.  Otherwise, punt to me; that was what I was there for.

I was cooking, one of my employees was serving someone, and the lack of drink came up.  She did perfect, suggested a chocolate phosphate perfectly, and even said it was her favorite (no lie, they are awesome).  Made me happy every time to hear that stuff.  Nope, demanding a free drink because McDonald's programmed them to.  Offered again, nope, more verbal diarrhea.

""SilentDis, could you come out here?""  

I'm dressed in faded as shit blue jeans, a dark tee-shirt, and a dirty-as-sin apron.  I look *nothing* like what an owner should look like. :D

Me: ""Yes?""  
Customer: ""I should get a drink with my meal!""  
Me: ""Not here, you don't.  Prices on the meals are as cheap as they come, ever had a raspberry dreamsicle soda?  I'll give you a taste if you'd like.""  
Customer:  ""Meals always come with sodas, you don't know what you're doing, I demand your manager!""  
Me:  ""Oh, okay, hold on.""

I turn to my left, 180 degrees.  I turn back around to my right and face her once again.

Me: ""How can I help you?""  
Customer:  ""YOU'RE NOT THE MANAGER i WANT THE MANAGER RIGHT NOW!""  
Me:  ""I'm the manager, would you prefer the owner?  Fair warning, the guy's a bit of a dick, though.""  
Customer:  ""HOW DARE YOU TALK LIKE THAT, I DEMAND TO TALK TO HIM NOW!""  
Me:  ""Alright, he won't be happy though.""

This time, I turn 360 in place.

Me:  ""Get the fuck out of my store.""

Another, similar 'free drink' customer was in, and one of my front-house girls took it upon herself.  I was seconds from coming off my line and dealing with it (I could hear everything, and knew where the conversation was going), when she stated, plainly ""Wow, last time I got that worked up was over wanting a pony.  I was 4.""  It broke me, I was in tears laughing very loudly and I'm certain the customer herd.  Red and still crying I rounded the corner to see the customer storm out the door.

First of I want you all to understand something very important. I want you all to understand how wonderful you are. All of you. I have posted three stories so far and I have not received a single negative comment. Do you know how rare that is? To find a subreddit where people are nice and civil to each other and where a little sarcasm is not looked down upon as “smartassery”. For that I thank you most humbly. Thank you fellow r/talesfromretailers, you are a delight and I feel honored that you enjoy reading these stories! 


And secondly I would like to dedicate this story to u/encore_une_fois as the biggest “thank you for the gold” I am able to give. I want you to remember, that when people are horrible, they usually get what they deserve. Even if it might not seem like it at first.

Thirdly: I realize that there were slightly more votes for the anthropological report on Powder Puffs, but it was time I told this story. So the Powder Puffs will have to wait, but I promise you'll get to meet them soon.

**So here it goes: Christina and The Steak**

On my very first barshift, back in 2008, my shift manager pulled me aside and told me of Christina and The Steak. They were well known at the bar for causing trouble, and I was to be on the lookout for them.  “But how will I know what they look like” was my, in my opinion, pretty dignified question. My shift manager merely laughed, “You’ll know” he said and went back to doing whatever it is shift managers do. I didn’t give it much more thought; I figured if they were violent I could just kick them out, simple right? Wrong!

A month or so would pass before I got to meet these two delightful characters. No delightful is not the word I’m looking for, I think colourful suits them better, yes, colourful. Christina was in an orange top, quite deep in the, eh, neck region. And blue pants that made her ass look about as wide as a barn. The steak wore a navy blue shirt with a fire breathing dragon curled around his sizeable beergut. Yes colourful is most certainly the word. They were both in their mid-forties and had that kind of look like life has been a bit rough. You know, the sagging cheeks, the eyes that never stay focused on one thing but seem to skid across the room constantly scanning for danger or opportunity, the lumbering walk that looks like a bitch (female dog you guys) about to give birth to the puppies she’s been carrying for too long.

My shift manager was right. I knew. The moment I saw them walk through the door. I knew. How did I know? Mainly because of him. The Steak was, I learned at that moment, not just a nickname. It was so much more. He was The Steak, there could be no doubt. He was big and tough and meaty, he even looked like he was a bit “under-cooked” if you catch my drift. He was the embodiment of a steak. If a steak and a human mated, this would be the result, of that I had no doubt.

Christina was cheery, The Steak, not so much. They sat down at the bar and he ordered a beer, she perused the drinks menu. Unsatisfied with the general selection she asked if I would make her something sweet. And then she winked. I thought I’d imagined it, or that it was involuntary, but I now know, it was most definitely voluntary and I most certainly did not imagine it. However I chose to ignore it, misjudgment on my part I’m sorry to say. I made some drink, I can’t even remember which, but then again the sickly sweet drinks have never been my cup of tea. 

She praised the drink, I thanked her and moved on to a customer and his “G’n’T, squeeze of lemon, darling”. I went through the motions: Glass, Ice, “Which Gin would you like?” (Sneak a peek at him, loose wrists, styled hair, skintight clothes, eyeliner. He’ll have Bombay) “Bombay, darling”, Jigger, Gin, Tonic, Knife, Lemon, Squeeze, Straw, “There you are. That’ll be 50 if you’d be so kind”, Card, Terminal, Register, “DING”, Receipt, Pen, Signature, “Thank you darling”. 

Short break: Read the above paragraph again, but this time with your most stereotypical gay man accent when you read his lines, it’s okay, we won’t judge you, much. It just adds so much more flesh to the character right? Okay, back to the bar.

Once done with **G’n’T, squeeze of lemon, darling** I cleaned up, wiped down the bar and then did the patient bartender spiel. (Your bartender does this too. It’s an act you put on, you stand around doing your best to not look bored when there are no customers, but in your mind you are either rehearsing the lyrics to “We Didn’t Start the Fire”, trying to remember what you had for breakfast or, if you are a dutiful employee, practicing different drinks in your head.)

 So there I was, silently in my head going: Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnny Ray, South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMa “This drink is reeeeeally good”. Her screeching voice cut me of halfway through the first verse. I look over and see her greedily suck the last drops through the straw. It makes that sound that you can in no way reproduce in writing, yet we all know it well. The sound of air and liquid being drawn through a slim tube on to a waiting tongue. The sound of slurpees and kids birthdays. The sound of movie theatres and unrelenting anger.

She pulls out the straw and licks the last drops off of it. Her much-to-red lipstick is smeared on her teeth. She pushes her glass across the bar and asks “will you make me something like this, sweet, but with a bit of a bite to it” and there it is again. That wink. This time I’m sure. She winked at me. But I’m not the only one who saw, The Steak did too. He shoots me this look, I’ve never seen it’s like. It was a sigh mixed with anger and regret, and just a touch of resignation. All this in one look. I was a bit blown away honestly, but I collected myself and made some random drink. Sweet with a bite, just like she asked.

Again she praised the drink, and gulped it down quicker than a 6 year old when told he can’t have that cookie. This time she asked for “something sweet and sexy”. How is a drink sexy? I know some drinks have sexy names, like sex on the beach or one night stand, but how does a drink taste sexy? I asked if there was anything on the menu she thought looked good, she shook her head, “no they look so simple and boring, I like what you do better” Wink. You know what lady? Screw you and your sexy drinks, and screw your wink to!

I made her the simplest drink I could think of. A screwdriver! Glass, Ice, Jigger, Vodka, Orange juice, (and then the twist, I added another ingredient, it colours so violently so I only used a drop, there was no way she could taste it) Blue Curacao, straw, stir, serve. Which colour does blue and yellow make? Green! How many drinks can you come up with that are green? Me, I’m a bartender, I can think of a few. But this woman, this Christina, I’ll bet you my favorite shaker she had never seen a green drink before. 

She went nuts! Bonkers! Mad! Completely frigging deranged! Over a drink, you guys. The most basic of drinks, the one I teach new bartenders first to explain the basics of drink making (or mixology if you insist). A screwdriver with a bit of colour mixed in and she was off her head. It was the best drink she had EVER had and I was just amazing and beautiful and talented andandand. I think she creamed her pants right on the spot, but no matter for this is where the story takes a slight turn.

The Steak, long overlooked and forgotten in the ecstasy his wife was living through her superb green screwdriver, got up. He didn’t say a word, he just got to his feet, drained his beer bottle, leaned slightly over the bar and **CRASH!** He brought the bottle  down, holding it by the neck, on the edge of the bartop and it smashed, leaving him a nice little stab weapon.

Still not saying a word, in the now completely silent bar, he looked at me, looked at his wife, lifted the bottle neck with the jagged edges glinting in the dim lights, he grunted at me in a manner I can only assume was to convey “you get what I’m hinting at?”. I nodded, just at short curt nod of acquiescence. That was enough, he sat back down, pushed the bottle neck across the bar to me and motioned for another beer. I was not happy with the situation, but at least the immediate danger was averted, or so I thought. I was wrong.

In my mind I quickly calculated how long till closing, half an hour. 30 minutes, I could manage that, no need to make any more out of the situation right? Again, I was wrong. This must go down in history as The Night Neomety was Wrong. The steak and I had made a silent agreement, none more would come of this, we had marked up the borders of our respective countries. Mine was Barghanistan, his Guestran. We shared a border but I would not invade his capitol, Christran, Tehstina (okay Guestran was bad enough, I can’t come up with a good pun on Tehran and Christina, sorry)his capitol, Christina and he would not drop a beer bottle shaped atom bomb on me. The peace treaty had been drawn up, all that was left was to sign it and we could enjoy peace in our time. 

Historians and people with a bit of knowledge of World War II will see the danger ahead, because when Neville Chamberlain said ""Peace in our time"", what did eventually come to pass? Well not peace, that’s for sure, and the same happened here. There was a Yoko Ono among us, a nagging little bitch who would not give peace a chance. A lipstick smeared teethed, orange shirted, blue pantsed, ass as wide as the Rio Grande little devil who decided this was her time to shine.

Goddamned maximum of 10000 characters! The last part will have to be in the comments, I'm really sorry about that, I didn't mean for it to get this long.

madeofstarlight,85,,76,1i5ubv,,380,"I worked at a retail store catering mostly to older, conservative women. We sold your everyday bra and panties. 

We had a stupid policy that as long as you had a receipt, or if your item had the original tag, we would take it back. It didn't matter if it had been worn 500 times, or if it was 10 years old. 

We also had a special going on, 3 bras for some amount a piece, not counting clearance or special-marked items. All the signs are clearly marked. 

This woman comes in and heads to my counter. I ask if I can help her, and she hands me a bag, and says she has a return, but wants to shop. I tell her no problem, I can process the return at the same time as her purchase. She goes somewhere in the store and a CA is helping her. I open the bag and this pungent smell of B.O. exists the bag. I pull out the bra. It at one point was white, but now looked grey and cornflower blue, had broken underwires, and had that feeling of sweat/had been sitting in the car for months. No receipt, but there's a tag without a price. I type in the UPC, and it tells me that the bra is now only worth $2. The bra is from 2003 when I catalog it. 

This customer was awful. She tried on no less than 30 bras, several of which were the same style and size but were different colors. She got makeup and deodorant stains on the dark colored ones, which we have to damage because they can't be resold. She questioned the price on every item, even though the sale had been explained to her repeatedly. Her total store time was over an hour. 

She comes back up to the desk, and decides she wants her return purchase and regular purchase to be separate. I give her additional items to my CA, who I was training. I process her return, which comes to $2.17. She asks, ""Why am I only getting $2 back for this item? It was 17.99 when I bought it and I just bought it a few months ago.""

I say, ""Ma'am, this is now a clearance bra and I can't give you the original price because it is not listed on the tag, and you have no receipt--"" and she cuts me off. ""But I came in 6 months ago and it was 17.99!"" I reply, ""Ma'am this bra is 10 years old. The style number is one I don't have in books from 5 years ago, and I have been here 3 years, and we haven't sold anything for 17.99 since 2009."" She stares at me for what feels like an hour. ""Can't you just take my word for it?"" I tell her sorry, there's nothing I can do. So, she takes her $2.17 and disappears in the store again and comes to the CA's register shortly after. 

She comes up with two promotion bras and a clearance bra. The clearance bra will already be half off. CA explains to her three times that the promotion won't work on two, only three, and the third she picked was clearance. She exclaims, ""This one was on the rack with these other ones I found"". CA explains that it clearly red marked and it must have been put there by mistake. Customer gets very angry at this point, ""You are trying to rip me off! I know you can give me the price I want but you are selfish!""

My CA looks at me, and asks what to do. I told her, ""Just give her the promo on the other two. I am tired of hearing her mouth."" The customer shuts up after that. CA finalizes her purchase. The customer looks up and says, ""I had a 20% off coupon. I don't have it with me, but can you look it up or use another one?"" I am so livid. ""Ma'am, the coupon is tied to your reward card, but unfortunately I have no way to look up your information."" Customer again throws a fit. ""WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! I COME HERE ALL THE TIME!!!!"" 

She snatches her bag off the counter. I stop her at the door, and hand her the bag of the nasty bra. ""Take this with you. This is something I can call OSHA over, and I do not want to subject my employees to touching decade-old filth."" 

She grabbed it and ran out of the store. Never to return, on my shifts, anyway. :) ","""Can't You Just Take MY Word For It?""",456,talesFromRetail
KotovSyndrome,79,,83,1nf7x2,,385,"So, I've already shared one story about working at LARGE RETAIL STORE CHAIN, why not another.

As I said previously, I was a cart pusher, and most of the time, I was the only one out of 3 of us that was actually doing his job.

Now, for the setting of this story, picture your typical LARGE RETAIL STORE CHAIN parking lot. Now picture it filled with buggies. Now picture some random guy, running a machine to push the carts down each of the rows in a vain attempt at getting the lot caught up.

Keep in mind, I'm the only one out there, as you've just got me and one other cart pusher who is currently preoccupied with his phone/foodstuff/nasal cavity/etc.

It's been like this for a good 3 hours now, and between having to run inside to bring out a TV or other large product, the lot is a wreck.

Countless times over the walkie-talkie, I've heard nothing but ""STOCKMAN, WE NEED BUGGIES ON _____ SIDE!"" ""STOCKMAN, WE NEED BUGGIES ON _____ SIDE!""
""STOCKMAN, YOU HAVE A CARRYOUT ON AISLE ____""

And since I'm the only one who cares that shit gets done, I'm the one who goes and gets said shit done.

Finally, after the 17th time in 2 hours I've had to hear ""STOCKMAN, WE NEED BUGGIES ON _____ SIDE!"" I lose it. I pick up the walkie, and say as angrily as I possibly can, ""I'll get to it when I can, I'm the only person out here doing his job, and I'd love some assistance, but every time I've asked, your managers up front refuse to send me anyone. I'm terribly sorry there aren't buggies there, I'm working on it.""

The walkie then goes silent until it's time for my last break, and on my way back to the break room, I'm stopped by the assistant manager who had asked me constantly to push buggies into each side. She looks at me and goes ""Manager Tom (The actual head manager of the store) was really upset with your tone. You need to learn how to control your anger.""

I looked her square in the eye and said ""You're right. I'm sorry. It's just the fact that no one outside does their job but me, and you do nothing about it."" and proceeded to walk on back.

She stood there for a moment before huffing back off.","""You upset the manager with your tone""",468,talesFromRetail
ravencrowe,91,,99,1ikfmt,,386,"Last summer I worked as a waitress at a fairly nice restaurant that served breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The layout of the restaurant is simple, it's basically one big room with windows that overlook a lake on the far end. People always want to sit at the stupid lake windows.

One weekday afternoon I was working the lunch shift. It was fairly quiet as usual, when in walks this 50-year-old Barbie doll. She had bleach blond hair done up like she was auditioning for Hairspray, turquoise eyes (color contacts I assume) with matching eyeshadow, and was as thin as a cancer patient. She clacks in on her high heels, taking those tiny beauty pageant steps while swinging her hips back and forth, walks right into the center of the room and loudly asks, ""Can we sit anywhere we want?""

Now, our restaurant was not seat yourself. Typically people would wait at the hostess stand, like you normally do, and one of us would come seat you. This was important because it ensured that the customers were fairly distributed among each of our sections. That, and we would also bring menus with us when we seated people, so no one ever had to wait for a menu (this is important). However, if customers asked for a specific booth or table, we would put them there. This got really annoying because people would always request the lake windows, which meant whoever was assigned to that section got way more customers and way more money than anyone else. Anyway, I digress. Since we would have put them wherever they asked anyway, one of the waitresses said, ""Uh, sure, I guess,"" and Barbie strutted over to a lake window booth.

A few minutes later, in walks Barbie #2. Obviously her sister (twin?), she looked exactly the same except that her hair was cemented into a slightly different (but equally big) hairstyle, and her eyes/eyeshadow were violet instead of turquoise. 

Now, the lucky waitress assigned to the lake windows today was Holly. Holly was everything the Barbies were *trying* to be: she was 40 but looked about 25, cute, thin, *naturally* blond, and just overall really pretty. She brought the Barbies their coffee, and as far as I could tell she didn't say anything more than ""How are you doing today"" to them.

As soon as Holly left their table, Barbie #1 approached me.

""Excuse me,"" she said, ""I don't mean to be rude, but we simply *refuse* to be served by that blond waitress.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, ""but she's assigned to the table your at today. Is there a reason why she can't serve you?""

""We just do not want her serving us!"" she exclaimed. *Sigh*

""OK, I'll see what I can do."" I found Holly in the waitress station and told her that the Barbies had rejected her. Holly laughed and said she didn't care, she didn't want to serve them anyway. This is when I found out that the Barbies are apparently notorious in the town my restaurant is in for their bad attitude and major middle-aged sluttiness. Apparently they always refuse to be served by waitresses who are younger and prettier than them (I was OK to serve them though. Thanks, I guess?). I offered to take care of them, because I was intrigued and figured I could get a good story to tell my friends about the time I served ""The Whores of [Town Name]"", as my coworker Laura called them.

I went to their table and told them that I would be serving them. As soon as I got there, one of them said, ""Excuse me, but we need some menus. That *blond* waitress forgot to bring us any! Can you believe that?!"" Bitch, maybe that's because you decided to seat yourself! I put on my best customer service smile and brought them some menus. The rest of the meal proceeded with them just generally being really demanding, pulling stupid power trips like asking me to bring extra extra extra cream and then not using any of it. The icing on the cake, though, was when they called me over to ""apologize"":

""I hope that blond waitress isn't offended that we didn't want her serving us,"" Barbie #1 said.

""Oh, no,"" I said with a giant smile on my face, ""not at all! Don't worry about it.""

""It's just, we don't want people *talking* about us, is all!"" said Barbie #2. Barbie #1 nodded in solemn agreement.

I reassured them that no feelings were hurt and no one would be talking about them. Then I went to the waitress station, where Holly and Laura and I talked about them for the rest of the day.

Lime_Time,69,,68,1glrc1,,384,"I work in a grocery store. In our POS, we have pictures of all the produce, so that if we don't know the number, we can look it up first alphabetically, and then identify by sight/name. 

Baby red potatoes look exactly like our ""jumbo"" red potatoes. There is barely any size difference. One is the size of two golf balls, one is the size of two and a half golf balls.

A lady comes up with her all organic, perfectly healthy order. Great, people with organics are usually friendlier than most! Nope. She's immediately rude, criticizing how I'm bagging her order as I scan it. She tells me to stop bagging. I comply, but I'm on an express register, so unless she does it herself, no one is coming to help. I finish totalling and ask if I can bag her things for her.

""NOOOOOooOOOOOooOOOOO!!!1!!1""

I assume she'll do it herself, but first, she begins to scrutinize the screen where it tells her the last few things I scanned and how much they were. This is where the trouble starts.

""YOU CHARGED ME FOR JUMBO RED POTATOES AND THESE ARE PETITE HOW DARE YOU THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS GET THIS RIGHT ALWAYS TRYING TO OVERCHARGE ME""

First, if it happens every time, why don't you just say what kind they are? Second, they look exactly the same. Third, it is a 20 cent difference between the two, and you got less than 2 pounds. I want to tell her all of this and more, but can't.

Apologizing, I take off the potatoes while she rants and re-ring them through as petites.

But wouldn't you know, the first time I rang them through, I had scanned them incorrectly as a bit underweight. The second time, the weight was correct. She ended up paying 16 cents more than if she hadn't said anything to begin with. 

After fixing it (which she didn't even notice she got charged more), she asked me why hadn't her items been bagged yet. Confused, I told her that I had tried twice. She demanded a bagger boy, because girls do not know how to bag groceries. Wat. I called one over anyways, glad to get her out of my line.","Po-tay-toes, po-tah-toes",452,talesFromRetail
TenthDoctor89,47,,83,1ekmo4,,380,"So I thought I'd submit something here for once, something that happened a few months ago. I work at a Petrol Station, which also has a supermarket section to it.

So there I am working the closing shift. A few customers every now and then, having to stock shelves and fridges between customers.

In walks a customer, who heads straight for our gift card stand. Grabs about 4-5 of them, and heads to the front counter and asks to buy them. I'm a little bit suspicious by this point, as we usually only sell 1 or 2 at a time. I think to myself that if he is paying cash, I wouldn't have much of an issue, except making sure the cash is not counterfeit.

The guy then pulls out one of the company cards that we have for business accounts. Alarm bells go off in my head and I'm thinking ""What should I do? We never have sold gift cards on business accounts"" and wondering how the guy will react if I deny the sale.

I excuse myself to ""check for authorisation"" and head to the office. The guy decides to tell me he bought 5 earlier in the day with no issues. I then decide to call my boss and try to hint to them that it is a potential fraud situation, without letting the customer know.

I told my boss that I had 4-5 $100 gift cards, to sell on a business account, and that I needed authorisation for the transaction. Thankfully they pick up on it straight away and ask me a few ""yes or no"" questions (do you suspect this to be fraud, are they regular customers, etc), and told me to deny the sale and mention they can call Accounts in the morning if they have any problems, and to call my boss back after they leave.

They get a bit annoyed but leave without further issues. I called my boss back and we discussed the probability of it being fraud, whether they really purchased 5 earlier (they did, and one of my coworkers got into trouble for not picking up on the potential fraud &gt;.&lt;), and told me to fill out a report for it.

I get a call the next day from my boss. I am told that the guy is the son of the owner of the business the account is linked to, and that he was buying the gift cards on his dads business account, then selling them for cash to fuel his drug habit. 

Got a little certificate for being attentive to potential fraud and got a free scratchie from one of the higher-ups (a simple incentive kind of thing).

TheJanks,43,,79,1n4tez,,376,"I'm not just an employee, I'm part-owner of a family business. We sell plants to other businesses or landscapers. It's not a normal product on a shelf, but a living product that demands special attention. 

Being family, I am not bound to suffer fools. I go out of my way to be a good vendor, but as we all know, some customers just live to take advantage of this and be horrible people. Well, I had a bad apple today and thought I'd share. 

Customer placed an order, and assumed he had a credit account. When told he didn't, he emailed the letter I wrote in January that spelled out his credit terms I gave him. I sent it back, highlighting the last three sentences that clearly stated 1.) he already had an invoice out as of today 2.) the due date of said invoice, and 3.) the statement, ""payment needs to be made on time, else his credit status would be revoked immediately"". I also sent him a copy of the check stub and envelope that was received TWO weeks past the due date for said invoice. I also wrote quite a bit more, a bit snarky actually, but this is the condensed version for reddit. 

The reply I got from him was what I expected, ""I wrote that check on the due date, per your terms. Mailing it later is a legal loophole I'm entitled to. The credit account is a contract that we have, because you gave it to me IN WRITING."" 

And that's why I saved the envelope for 9 months -- he is not the first person who thinks I would go, ""Oh snap, legal loophole! I must send you my product now!""

Since I already called him out on this bullshit (and more) in the letter I sent him, I told him he doesn't have credit, nor am I in a legal position to give him credit, and I'll respectfully request prepayment for all orders for now on. 

He didn't ask for how long, which is sad because I have my standard answer I've used in the past for when customers push all the wrong buttons trying to scam, cheat, or take advantage of us. That answer is, ""Till the sun goes supernova, scorching the Earth and eradicating all forms of life from its surface. This is better than the alternative time period, which is 'indefinitely'. so you can't say I'm not unreasonable."" 

The above policy was first used about 10 years ago customer who came to our place of business driving a brand new Lexus, with the temp-plates still on it. We refused to load the plants into her car, simply because it was a brand new Lexus, and I would not be blamed for the damage caused to it by our plants. She was welcome to go get a pickup truck OR load the plants herself. She loaded the plants herself. Then the following day, threatened to take us to small claims court if we refused to pay for the detail work needed to clean up the damage from the dirt and water that leaked from the buckets!  We told her that was her decision, but we would never sell to her again now because we don't appreciate being threatened with lawsuits after doing our best to prevent that damage. She did not like the term ""indefinitely"", so I made up the whole bit about the sun going supernova on the spot...and it's stuck. 

Hmm. Another one?

Customer had credit status for years, was a great customer. One bad year came up, and he decided to stock up heavy on product in hopes it would all move, and he could make some money back. It did not move - and he did not pay us. We took legal action in small claims court and made it clear that if we would represent ourselves, keep the lawyers out of it, it would save us BOTH money, because let's face it, he doesn't have a case. He got a lawyer. So sadly, we had to get a lawyer. We won the case, and he had to pay our lawyer fees. He ended up having to owe his lawyer and our lawyer more money than what he owed us.  When he mailed us the last payment for it all, he did have a sticky note affixed to the check, ""I am sorry I was an idiot - should not have hired a lawyer"". I was happy he said that. We still sell to him...but payment up front. 

Another customer like the one above -  we won a judgement in small claims court, but as some of you may know, getting someone to pay is tough. With a legal background check, I was able to find all his assets, and discovered he has a very nice boat on a lake 30 miles from  us. We went to the sheriffs office with our judgement, told them about the boat, and 3 hours later the boat was being pulled out of the water on a trailer on loan from the sheriffs department to be locked up in hopes that we would get cash instead of the boat.   The customer...was livid as hell. We went back to court, and he had the audacity to tell the judge we could not take assets that would diminish his business income, as per legal rights. The judge asked him why he needed a boat, to which he said, ""I do landscaping for customers that have property lakeside, and take them out on my boat to show them what it looks like from the lake"" . The Judge had a very good laugh, and said not good enough. A check was cut 1 hour later. 

Customer came in and bought plants. Complained a week later they were the wrong cultivar (one is upright, one grows sideways) and he wants a refund. I told him that's not possible, as we only had one type in stock for the past 2 years - the other simply has not been on this property in 2 years. He argued left and right and even sent us a fuzzy picture of it.  I plugged the picture into a program and got GPS coordinates of it - 20 miles away. Hopped in my truck and drove out there, and called him while standing in the yard. Told him that there's characteristics of this plant in the leaves and flowers, and this is CLEARLY the plant he originally ordered. I then sent him pictures of it, and found our original plant label on one of them specifying the cultivar. He has no damn clue how I found that house, was very angry, and promised never to come back after this poor customer service. 

We see him once a week still.

A woman with a huge cart piled *HIGH* with food appears suddenly, like a wild Pokemon, from one of the aisles and makes it to the Express Lane before me.


*The Express Lane.* Twelve items or less lane. With a full sized cart. She must have had over a hundred items! It's not like there weren't other lanes open. Lanes with baggers and conveyor belts for carts such as hers. But *NO*. Instead she picks the Express Lane, with its tiny counter for placing your purchases and no belt and only room to bag items *one bag at a time*.

My cashier in the full size lane, a really sweet women who is normally right on top of cheerfully greeting me, is busy just *staring daggers* at this woman.  The woman is acting totally oblivious to her social etiquette massacre, casually flipping through a copy of US weekly while her children scurry to unload the cart.


""Ma'am,"" she says, ""It will be much faster for you if you use a full size lane.""


""Oh, it's fine. You already have a line,"" the woman says, like her choice makes perfect sense and is totally logical and not at all an inconvenience for everyone. It's true about the line, though. Upon seeing the woman with the gigantic cart the other patrons have all chosen to file in behind me. The Express Lane cashier looks extremely flustered by this point. Clearly pissed, my cashier turns to me and we go through the normal pleasantries.

This past Monday was extremely annoying, more than usual. Not only did those idiot customers come in, but we had a few styles of shoes that we no longer being sold in our store. In addition to other projects that needed to be completed, we were running around like crazy. Of course we were helping out customers when they came into our department, but otherwise we were moving shoes from back, making new displays, and pretty much rearranging our entire department. 

I was by the cleats section when I saw her. Middle aged, blonde woman with her middle-school aged son. They both sat down on a bench in the section, so that was my cue to give my best retail line, ""Can I help you find anything today?""

The lady looked me up and down (pet peeve of mine), and said that they're fine. Not that they're just browsing or that they need a few minutes, just that they're fine. I told them my next normal line that if they need help, that they can feel free to ask me or my two other coworkers that I mention by name and point out where they are. She says thank you, and I leave to keep rearranging the department.

About 5 minutes pass, and we're all deep into our projects. All of the customers in our department, minus the lady and her son, are satisfied with trying on their shoes and we're all at a happy balance. In the background, I hear the store phone ringing, but keep working as I cannot answer it. 

My manager, who happens to be my favorite manager, goes over our radio saying that a lady just called in asking for help in footwear. What?

My coworker sweeps the area looking for someone who has not been helped, and finds the lady in the cleats looking for something for her son to try on.

I see my manager, and I decide to ask her what the hell the phone call was about. Here's what my manager said:

""The lady said that she sees three people working in footwear and nobody will come up to her to help her. She literally said, 'Your employees will not approach me. Tell them to do their job'""

What the heck? She admits to seeing us in the department, but knows we're busy busting our butts to get the place rearranged and thinks we're blatantly ignoring her? Instead of waving us over or approaching us, she decides to not get off her lazy ass and find our store's number on her phone only to call my boss to try to get us in trouble? 

The best part is that my manager thought that was bizarre and didn't care about that lady's concern. She had admitted to seeing us all on the sales floor, which is something that management tells us that we must do, which is be visible at all times. We were all on the sales floor, doing work that has to get done that day. My coworker made sure to be annoying by checking in with her a lot. I know that's the point where it sounds immature, but what was this lady's intention? Trying to get us in trouble to get fired? I don't know, but I'm glad I'm getting about 3 weeks off soon for my wedding and honeymoon.

**TL;DR** Customer who waved off our help calls my manager while in the store to make us look bad. The sad thing is that all she had to do was get up from where she was sitting, walk 10 feet, and get help.","""Your employees will not approach me. Tell them to do their job""",490,talesFromRetail
Wrexoul,24,,82,1e7px9,,375,"More classic Jeff.

Friday mornings are manager meeting days.  It's important for review, and more so for preparation for the busy weekend.

Jeff bursts into my office at 7:05 AM.
""Boss, I have to go.""
""Go where Jeff?"" I replied, ""Meeting starts in 20 min.""

""I just shit my pants.""


--Silence--


I've been a retail manager for a good number of years, but at that moment I couldn't seem to recall exactly what my extensive training and experience said to do in that circumstance.

Jeff understood my reflective silence to mean a denial of his request, and became urgent.
""I'm not kidding, I'll go get my soiled underpants, I threw them in the waste basket""

""No Jeff, just go.  Call me later when you can talk.""

SportRider,29,,102,1djz6z,,377,"Ok so i worked in the deli/prepared food section of a grocery store. It is a roughly 30 foot long counter with the deli at one end and prepared food at the other. The deli is open much later then prepared foods.

Every Wednesday we sell fried fish in the prepared food section. Now our fish is really good and we sell a lot of it. Sorta famous around the old people community. So much so that we actually have call ins and orders for it to be reserved. We usually sell out around 3 pm but always stop selling a 6 pm. Our story takes place at 6:30 pm

This belligerent angry blob of a human being walks in and stares at the empty section where the fish is normally kept.
(Note at this time we had forgotten to take down the big white sign 4 foot by 3 foot that read ""Sold out of fish"") After about 6 minutes we make the 20 foot walk over to her to see if we can help. 
Blob - Gime 4 fish samiches 
Me - Sorry but we sold out hours ago. We also stop selling them 30 minutes ago
Blob - Stop lying to me i know for a fact you keep all the good fish for yourself behind that door! she was pointing at a large metal door the said ""FIRE EXIT alarm will sound"" 

So despite by better judgement to say ""Yup you caught us then throw her out the same door"" I spent 5 minutes trying to tell her the fish was gone before just passing her off like a screaming child to my manager. As i went back to my other duties, I watched as it took my boss 17 minutes to console the belligerent blob finally she yells ""You are all fish hoarding liars! and storming off""

RedRing14,45,,84,1px2uj,,374,"Hello again TFR.  I'm sorry I missed you over the weekend and by doing that I might have upset some people I promised a theft story to.  So today I rectify that with the theft story that was promised.

This one just as the other 2 I am working at the game store that I loved.  

Let us first set up the fun fact of at this time the store wasn't as staffed as it should have been for the holidays.  I didn't like hiring holiday workers because they just didn't seem to work out well and it wasn't fair to them in some ways but that's neither here nor there.  Now the downside to that was that it caused me to work at lot more.  

For about 3 months I worked everyday and a lot (most of) those days I pulled open to close shifts so that my guys had cover.  I didn't mind the shifts at all though as it was a blast.  If you love your job you never work a day in your life.  I loved being there and even worked whenever I went home trying to find things to make the store better.  However eventually it does begin to wear on you.

So we fast forward to January and I'm going to have my first day off since October.  My guys knew that I was not to be bothered unless the world was going to collapse into a black hole.  I close down the shop for the last day of my stretch getting out of there at around 10:30.  I locked the store up and went home getting ready to lay in my bed and not get up for a long time as I put my day back as being a late close shift.  Get home at around 11 and fall asleep by 11:30 which normally I cant do.  

Suddenly at around 3 am I am woke up by my phone.  I recognize the number as the district manager.  I answer the phone and know its going to be something I will hate hearing.  He informs me that someone has broken into the store and the police need someone to come down and of course that meant me.  I get dressed and go to the store using very colorful language to the nice person who broke in.

The guy managed to steal a bunch of games, consoles, movies, and snacks from the store and rental place connected to it.  He completely destroyed the store in the process of it to.  You would have thought a bunch of frightened dear had been let loose in there.  The nice thing was that he also decided to bleed all over the store because he cut his stomach pretty bad on the top of the fence that separated our stores.  I stood around as the police did their final sweep and answered a bunch of super fun questions from the officer then went home and fell asleep probably around 4:30.

The next morning at 10 I get a frantic call from my opener saying someone broke in.  Apparently he didn't get my text message or anything.  Told him we already knew and he went on to continue working.  Noon rolls around and my dm calls to let me know they didn't get anything that was really useful but the guy who robbed us also robbed the grocery store near by for alcohol and ace bandages.  

Fast forward a week and we have decided we were just sol when it came to the merchandise.  While doing some video editing on my laptop for a promo video I hear a ruckus outside the store.  I look out and a woman who is probably in her late 50's, 5'4, and maybe 120 pounds is screaming at the car.  Suddenly she goes to the passenger door and rips it open to yell at the guy in the seat.  She yanks her 17 year old, 6'2, 250lb son out of the car by the ear and drags him into the store.  We will call her AM for angry mom. He will go by T for thief.  I will be playing the role of myself and my costar will be OSM for other store manager.

AM: Well get on with it lets get this done.

T: No mom please (through tears)

AM: You made a mans decision now be a man!

T: I'm so sorry mom I love you.

Me: Mam can I...

T: I'M SORRY I STOLE FROM YOU GUYS!

Me: Um....

AM: Boy you better do better than that!

T: It was me I robbed you guys. I'm so so sorry.  Please don't call the cops.  I'm really sorry.  You can have the games back I brought them. 

(He had a trashbag of our stuff but at this point I'm trying not to laugh)

OSM: We have to call the police.

T: OH GOD NO!  MOM PLEASE HELP!

AM: No.  You decided to do this so you will face the consequences.

He continued to beg as we dialed 911.  He tried to get up and move towards the door but his mom got in the way of him and smacked him until he crumpled.  The cops came and arrested him.  When they entered the mom turned over the gun he used to rob the grocery store.

Aeosculap,41,,61,1kgvd7,,377,"Hello again.  Thank you all for the positive responses. And thanks also for the Bank subreddit, hadn’t seen this one before.  Here’s another recent adventure in absurdity, it’s long but I had to try to quote everyone as well as I can remember. The phone rings…

Me:”Thank you for calling Retail Bank, Hi my name is Me, how can I help you today?”

Bad Liar (BL): “I need a refund on an order of checks I placed with you, it was mailed to my old address and has my old address printed on them”

Me:”And are you sure we have the correct address?”

BL:”Yes, I changed it months ago.”

Collect her information, verify we correct address on file, look up her history and the check order…
Me:”Ms. BL,  I see that six months ago you changed your address from address A to address B, and looking at the check order placed two weeks ago, I do see that the checks were printed with and shipped to address B. How did you find out they were there?”

BL: “That’s my parents’ house, they called and told me the check order came to them.”

Me:”Good, then you don’t feel your account number is compromised?”

BL:”No”

Me:”Alright then, well we’re ok with you using checks with the wrong address if you want to keep them; if not, I can reorder checks for you, I do see where the system is not loading the new address to the checks, but that’s an easy fix for a new order”

BL:”No, I don’t want checks with the wrong address. Can you send me new checks with the new address, but I don’t want to pay for them because you guys made the mistake?”

Me:”According to the history, it says you placed the check order from our website, logged into your online account access, is that correct?”

BL:”Yes”

Me:”Ok, when you placed the check order, did it not show an image of the checks at the top of the screen?”

BL:”Yes, I saw that it had the old address there, but I figured you guys would notice is was the wrong address, and I didn’t see how to change it, so I just ordered it that way.”
I know this screen she’s on, I’ve seen it multiple times. Under the picture of the checks you’re ordering (with your information on them) is a big bright blue box with all of the text that’s going to appear on the checks, labeled “To edit Checks”, and it lets the customer change everything from the spelling of their name, what address appears on the checks, what address they’ll ship to, the check numbers that will print, even add extra stuff by the address if they want. Immediately underneath this box is the button the customer pushes to place the order, labeled “Confirm order.”

Me:”Alright M’am, no one actually reviews the check orders you place yourself, the system is completely automated. If you saw the address was wrong, why didn’t you call us?”

BL:”I thought you’d notice. Can you please order me the right checks? But I still don’t want to pay for them since your system had the wrong address.”

Me:”Let me ask. Hold please.”
She’s been polite and calm the entire time, even though she made a dumb move, so I decide to ask my boss if there’s anything we can do. She shakes her head, but says to go ahead and send her a free order of 50 with the correct address as a compromise.

Me:”Alright M’am, so we’re going to correct the address  for future orders, and I’ve gotten permission to order you 50 free checks for your correct address. If you don’t want to use the prior order, that’s fine, do you trust the people who have them now to shred them for you?”

BL:”Yes. But isn’t that not a full order?”

Me:”Correct, a normal order is 150 checks, but as this wasn’t a bank error, we’re not willing to refund the full cost of the check order.”

BL:”But it’s not my fault.”

Me:”M’am, the order screen shows you what you’re ordering, and you did confirm the wrong address.”

BL:”No it didn’t, it uh… said it couldn’t show me an image for security reasons. I wondered if it would go to the right address, but I didn’t see it show address A.”

Me:”I’m sorry, but it didn’t show you the image?”

BL:”Yeah.”

Me:”That’s… odd. Can I place you on hold again?”
And place her on hold. I’ve already placed the free partial order while we were talking. I know she’s lying, but just for the hell of it, I call the department that oversees customer’s website activity. They confirm for me that she’d indeed seen what I thought she’d seen, even emailing me a screenshot, which I immediately forward to my boss. Back to the phone

Me:”M’am, I checked with the website department, and they were able to see where there were two places on the ordering screen where you would see the address, even if the check image didn’t load, right above the button to confirm the order, there’s a big blue box…” and explain about the box. As I’m speaking, I see my boss get up, go fetch the branch manager, and bring him over to her desk.

BL:”I didn’t see it. Can you please refund the order?”

Me:”No m’am, as there was no bank error, we cannot refund the fee.”
The phone line goes quiet, and I can hear sounds of the phone being moved, and a hushed conversation away from the phone. My boss and the branch manager leave her desk and come over to me as a male voice picks up the other end.

Tool, speaking in a hostile tone:”Hi, this is BL’s boyfriend, look you’re going to refund BL the check order, and you’re going to give her free checks for address B.”

Me:”I’m sorry sir” look at the account real quick, check and no there’s no one else on BL’s account, thank the gods, there’s a privacy law that says I can’t speak to Tool about anything for her account “But I can’t speak to you regarding Ms. BL’s account, as I don’t see you’re on the account. I’ve already given her our answer. I can answer questions for her if she’d like to speak to me again.”

T, even more hostile tone:”Look, we’re practically engaged, You are Going to Refund the fees to her, and you’re Going to Give her Free Checks!”

I basically repeat the same thing I just told him. We repeat this same exchange three more times. My boss and branch manager are both looking at me, smirking.

T:”That’s it, I’m done with you, what’s your name?” I provide my first name only “You need to have your Branch Manager call me back, I’m reporting you and your company!”

Me:”Ok sir, can I get your name and phone number to give to him?”

T:”No!”

Me:”………….. I’m sorry?”

T:”You’re not giving me shit, I’m not giving you shit!”

Me:”… So let me see if I have this right, you want me to have the Branch Manager call you, but you won’t give me your name or your phone number?” (I swear I wasn’t trying to be smart, it just came out)

T:”Yes! And he’d better call me soon!” and hangs up

I look up, and in addition to both my boss and the Branch Manager, every one of the customer service employees is silently standing where they can see me, watching and listening. I put down the phone…  and start cracking up. It takes me a minute to catch my breath and then confirm for them that yes, Tool had actually said that. Branch Manger asks me to email him a synopsis with BL’s account number and phone number, I assume for the probably incoming complaint later. I admit, this one made my day.

TheBloodTypo,139,,104,1f2wbc,,376,"I work at a rather large office supply store. A few months ago, they changed the register system. Instead of the employee just ignoring the ""e-receipt?"" prompt, now the customer has to choose from three buttons: printed, emailed, or printed AND emailed. What a concept! 

But you'd think this is quantum string theory to these people. 80% of the time, I just say it out loud for them: ""Do you want me to print or email your receipt?"" Every single time, they reply ""Yes."" So then I reach over to the pinpad and push the Printed button for them and they just say ""Oh."" That's not what frustrates me.

What's frustrating is the other 20% of the time. If a customer has been rude to me somehow, I'll just let the prompt stay there without asking them verbally. Most of the time, they read the prompt and just ignore it like I did something wrong. They'll just start staring up at the ceiling or twiddling their new staples or something. 

But some customers will read the prompt and get really angry. ""I DON'T WANT NO DAMN EMAILS. WHAT DO I PUSH. I'M NOT GIVING YOU MY EMAIL ADDRESS!"" So I just tell them to push Printed. ""But then you're gonna have my email!"" Yes, because I magically have access to your email address based on your finger print. 

And then there are the customers who will tell me ""Oh, I get enough email! I don't need more spam!"" I hear this at least ten times a day, and they expect me to smile or laugh every time, like the whole ""WELP MUST BE FREE"" bit.
I know a ton of stores do the whole emailed receipt thing now. Why is this so difficult for customers to understand?

spedmonkey,59,,59,1b3ari,,378,"Since hours got cut after the holidays, I usually work one night per week at a certain national chain corner drug store. About six months ago, we introduced a new rewards card, that you need to have in order to get our sale prices. It's also corporate policy that we don't have store cards available if customers don't want to sign up for one. For most customers, it isn't a problem, and they'll either sign up or just pay full price, but every once in awhile we get someone stubborn who demands to speak to a manager, who invariably tells them that there's nothing they can do. This usually shuts up the customer, who either pays or leaves. Usually.

Then, of course, there's this lady. An older woman, probably about 55 or so, she first came in a few months ago, about an hour before closing, and brought a pack of toilet paper, some chips, and a few other sundries up to my register. We chat normally as I ring up her items, then ask if she has a rewards card with us. ""I don't,"" she says. I tell her our store policy, and she just stares at me. After literally about 15 seconds of this, she asks me to get the manager. I do so.

He comes up, she asks him to override the policy. He explains that he can't, it's store policy, it only takes about a minute to sign up for a card, and she'll be able to use it every time she comes back in the future. She gives him the same 15 second stare, then says, ""this is price discrimination, and I'm going to call the police on you, and your anal retentive employee here [me].""

We both look at her in disbelieving shock, then both simultaneously try to explain that the police won't do anything, because there's nothing illegal going on. She cuts us off, and demands the name of the store's general manager, who we'll call Mary. My manager tells her, and tells her she'll be welcome to come in or call tomorrow and talk to Mary about our policy.

Not. Good. Enough. She demands Mary's home number so she can call her *right now* (nearly 10:00 PM by this point). My manager refuses, naturally. She demands it again. This goes on for an absurd amount of time, until before we know it, it's five minutes until closing time. Finally my manager throws up his hands and tells her that we need to close, so he'll price modify her purchase to the sale prices this once, but that she shouldn't expect to be able to do this again. I change the prices as she glares at me, then she pays, all of this in silence. She grabs her bags, and as she walks out the door, says, ""thank you SO MUCH for your help, you two. I'll make sure to call Mary tomorrow and let her know what a good job you did, being Nazis."" My manager and I both agree that we're going to close as quickly as possible and go to our respective homes to drink heavily.

Fast forward to the next weekend, and wouldn't you know it, about an hour before closing in walks the same customer. I recognize her immediately, and immediately call the manager on duty (a different one than last time) to warn him that his services are probably going to be needed. She walks up and pretends not to recognize me. I ring up her stuff, then with a mental sigh, ask her for her rewards card. She starts the 15 second stare, and halfway through, I say, ""why don't I just call the manager now and save us both the trouble."" Before she can answer, I grab the phone and page him up to the front. 

While we wait for him to come, she says, ""I don't understand why you're being so disrespectful. I hope you know that you're being extremely rude to me already, and I don't appreciate your terrible attitude."" As I bite off my retort, the manager comes, and since I've already briefed him, he knows what to expect. The lady goes through the same price discrimination spiel, the manager pulls out our store policy, which he had grabbed as soon as I had talked to him and quotes the relevant passages verbatim to her. Once again, this continues for an excruciatingly long time, as she drops Mary's name repeatedly and tells the manager that Mary had told her personally that she was allowed to be the one exception to the policy. My manager tells her in the most polite terms possible that this is clearly not true, she asks if he's calling her a liar, and so it continues. Finally, it once again is about five minutes 'til closing time, so he tells her that he's not playing games with her anymore, and she's not going to get the sale prices this time. She stands there, her mouth agape, and huffily decides to pay full price (about $0.75 more than the sale prices). Naturally, she can't leave without a parting shot, and tells us that we're both racists and generally scummy people, and that this time she's calling Mary *for real* to tell her about it. We just shake our heads.

Several months pass, and I don't see her again, until last weekend. Same deal - an hour before closing, she comes in. We have a new manager, and it's her first night ever closing alone. I call her and apologize profusely for what's about to happen, and I can hear her facepalm over the phone.

The customer comes up and, once again, pretends not to recognize me. I politely ring up her stuff, and ask her for her card. She gives me the stare. ""Look,"" I tell her, ""our policy hasn't changed since the last time you came in here. You can either sign up for the card, or pay full price."" She demands to see the manager. As a last-ditch effort, I tell her, ""Look, I'll call her, but seriously, nothing has changed. It's just going to waste the time of all three of us."" She gives me the stare again. I call the manager. Whatever.

As we wait for her to come up, she tells me, ""I think I'm starting to dislike you, *sir*."" I respond by telling her that she's disliked me for awhile now. She acts all offended, saying that she's never seen me before in her life. I remind her that she's called me an anal retentive scummy Nazi racist. She insists that I'm lying, and says that I have a terrible attitude (again). I tell her, with all the disdain I can inject into my voice, that I'm sorry she feels that way.

The manager comes up, and the customer launches into her usual routine. The manager cuts her off after about five minutes and tells her, ""Look, I just talked to Mary this morning. She mentioned you specifically as an example of how we can't change our policy. Further, you can't insult me and my employees here. So, you have three choices here: you can sign up for the card, you can pay full price, or you can leave. End of discussion."" She walks off.

The customer is left speechless. Finally, she mutters under her breath for a bit, then tells me that she'll sign up for the card. She gives me obviously fake information (like that her birthday is in 1999). Whatever, I don't care enough at this point to call her on it. I scan the card, and lo and behold, none of her items are on sale, meaning she saved no money at all. She's flabbergasted, and tries to argue, but I pull out our weekly ad and point out that none of her things are in it. I can't help but smirk at her, and she tells me that I've completely humiliated her, and she's going to complain about our entire store, from Mary down to me, to our CEO himself. She then storms out, and my manager immediately walks back up to the front from behind a shelf where she was observing, high-fives me, and tells me to go take an extra break because fuck that bitch.

So I was working at the customer service desk. It was about 10pm, the store was open until midnight, I was closing down the customer service desk as usual. This lady come in with a shopping cart that is covered with a blanket. I ask her how I can help her. She proceeds to tell me she had purchased an automatic kitty litter box and that it wasn't working correctly. 

She proceeds to lift the blanket off the cart. In the cart is an automatic kitty litter box, full of cat shit and piss. Then the smell hit me. My nose was burning from the smell of ammonia.  I asked her to put the blanket back over the cart and she started yelling at me because the litter box would no longer ""push the clumps into the container"" and that her house smelled like that for weeks now. 

I looked at her and said ""did you have it plugged in?"" she looked at me like I has spouted a second head. After about 30 minutes of going back and forth about the nasty litter box I asked her if she had a receipt, ""No I ain't got the damned receipt!"" I asked her if she had the box, ""Why would I keep a box that it came in?"" I then told her I could not do the return. I asked her to take the nasty litter box back outside with her. 

She took the blanket off the cart, picked up the litter box and dumped it on the floor in front of the service, then, and I shit you not, she got down on her hands and knees and started rubbing it around on the floor with her hands and meowing like a cat. I called management and they escorted her out of the store.

This store was the only grocery store on the small island that caters to the richest locals and the large group of tourists that visit each summer. It was not uncommon to get a family in buying $500 with of groceries to supply a vacation house for the week. I was a cashier at this store and I was used to these kind of transactions but one in particular will stay in my memory forever.

A family group rolled up to my register with two shopping carts loaded with beach food. They proceed to chat with me about the weather, what is around the area, and so on. The people talking to me most are the mother and father. As I am punching in a large number of limes into the register, I notice another member of the group walk up. It was a rather pretty girl around my age (17)  and I'm guessing the daughter. I turn to give her my best southern gentleman smile and greeting when she nearly shouts to her mom,

I've got SAND in my VAGINA!!!
Not only did she yell that but she did this full on air craft landing motion towards her crotch with both hands.

I froze. I felt that gutteral, composure smashing laugh welling up inside me. I prayed to every god I could think of, in that split second, for no one to look at me. I could let it go and keep it together if no one acknowledged my existence.

No such luck. The mom saw my face, pointed at me and started laughing. I cracked up and laughed so hard I had to set my head on the scanner to try to stop the tears. The dad, the mom, and I stood laughing for a minute solid as the girl turned every shade of red possible and ran outside. 

I stood laughing gently as I finished ringing up the rest of their order. Hopefully the girl learned what things are appropriate to shout and what are not

calador,41,,90,1rdykp,,379,"In 2002, I worked for a national discount department store that had filed for bankruptcy. I was the Upfront Supervisor and worked the Customer Service desk. The company decided to close stores in waves. My store was in wave two. The closing did the usual ""Store Closing! X0% off! Everything Must Go!"" signs everywhere. In smaller print under this was the caveat ""All sales final. No exchanges or returns."" This was printed on the receipt and an employee stood at the door highlighting this line and repeating it verbally before thanking them for their business. 

We were about two months into the 3 month closing sale when this 30-something man who we will call DC comes in wearing nice clothes that obviously came from one of the high-end malls within a 20 minute drive of our store.

DC was carrying a box for an RC car. He drops it on the counter in front of me and asks for a refund. I apologize and tell him that I can't give him a refund as we were closing and all sales were final. I mentioned that the manufacturer's warranty was still valid and he could contact them for repair or replacement. He started getting upset. For five minutes or so, he proceeded to verbally harangue me and said that the reason our store was closing was ""poor customer service."" I tried in vain to calm him down as he got louder and more vulgar. Finally, I asked him to either quiet down or leave. He spoke right over me, telling me where to shove this broken RC car. I snapped. 

&gt;Me: Sir, I have repeatedly asked you to calm down. Unfortunately, all sales are final. We are closing. We have signs on all the support poles and every aisle in the store saying this.

&gt;Me: Sir, I have waited 6 long years to say this to one of you pretentious pricks. Shut up! You are not always right. In this case, you are definitely wrong. I have told you several times that I can do NOTHING for you. Sure, I can get my manager here. They will tell you the same thing I have been trying to get past your perfectly styled thick hair.

alpha_orionis,29,,66,1hugb1,,382,"Hey TFR! I meant to post this story a while ago when it happened, but I got sidetracked. 

Anyway, as I've said before, I work at a pet store. I was covering someone in petcare for their lunch when an older lady and who I assumed to be her very young granddaughter came over to our fish wall. The grandma explained they were in for some comets to go in their pond, so I grabbed my gear and set up to catch ten large comets. 

Now, I'm pretty aggressively childfree, but I have no problem with well-behaved kids. Since the granddaughter was being so polite, I waved her over and told her to pick out the fish. If you've never seen comet tanks in a large retail setting, imagine a twenty gallon tank with hundreds of goldfish inside. It can be a pain in the ass to catch specific fish in a tank so full, but it wasn't busy so I didn't care. She picked some really nice ones with great color and long, gorgeous fins. One in particular was an almost-calico with fins for miles that was one of my favorites. After she had picked the fish, I bagged them up and did my little ""make the kids promise to take care of their fish"" shtick— ""Okay, do you promise to feed your fish so it grows big and strong? Promise to love it and keep it safe forever? Cross your heart, pinky swear?"" etc. It's corny, but these damn kids just eat it up, I tell you. 

 I handed off the fish and sent the two on their merry way. All of a sudden, the little girl comes running back, grandma in tow. 

""What your name?"" she asked me. 

""I'm alpha_orionis,"" I told her. 

She pointed at the pretty calico fish in the bag and said, ""I call this one alpha_owionis.""

Me: I have no idea what you're talking about.

Man: (Shows me the work order- it says our store name, etc. and that's about it) Well it says here to report to store manager at this address.

Me: Let me call my manager.

I called my boss and got him up to speed. As expected there was no work to be done at our store. There has never been anyone there overnight except floor cleaners in the five years I've worked there. He tells me to get that man out of the store and make sure he's gone before we leave the building. I tell the man that it must be a mistake  and he leaves. He did so very agreeably.

He had nothing with him except that paper. No instructions on what he was doing, tools,  or any details whatsoever.  He walked to his car and just sat in it. He was there for over 20 minutes, during which he called the store and asked for me.
When I picked up the phone, no one was there.

It all felt wrong, so I called the police. He drove off about one minute after I called them. The officer told us to call again if he came back and that was that.

I just looked up the name of the company on his work order and it is a legit local contractor, so maybe it was a mistake. At any rate, I'm glad nothing happened.

Is this a thing people do to rob stores? It didn't occur to me at first, but I could see that trick working on a few people.

**I will be back from work at about 6:30 PM eastern and I will let you know what I've found out (no smartphone so I can't update from work). My store manager wanted to handle everything and he hasn't gotten back to me yet, so I will find out when I get there in a few hours.  Thanks for the interest everyone. Even if it turns out to be nothing I think it's a good lesson in safety.**

**UPDATE**:The guy was legit, but was sent out for the job ONE MONTH EARLY  for some insane reason. He was just a temp worker that would have been assisting the actual contractor who would have had all the tools, instructions, and so on... which is why he had no idea what was going on. He was sitting in his car calling  his temp agency to see what was up and apparently they called him back when I went to pick up his call, which is why he didn't answer. He was innocent, but everything he said and did made him seem completely creepy.

The moral of the story: play it safe, folks. If it feels off to you, don't ignore that. Better safe than sorry.

FigN01,54,,82,1922nh,,377,"I work as a sales associate at a local pet store where we have quite a few customers who come in with young kids who are always excited to see all the cool pets we have. I don't blame them; I sometimes wish I still had their level of fascination with fairly ordinary animals, but I'm trying to do a job and as much as I like showing off a snake or bird, we're not paid to give tours of our domesticated zoo. If we're too busy or I have literal shit to clean on top of every other maintenance job, it ain't gonna happen unless they're looking to buy.

So cue a family of 6 coming in with little kids running from one pet display to another asking 'What's this, what's that, what's everything-in-the-frickin-store?' The kids aren't exactly causing problems; they just have a level of hyperactive curiosity that I can't deal with because I'm catching 3 dozen crickets for another customer to feed to her lizards at home. So after making a tour around the counter, asking everything about the animals short of what their shoe size is, they see me reaching into a gigantic white tub of jaw-dropping mystery.

Kids- ""What are you doing? What's in there?""

Me- ""I'm catching crickets for that lady over there.""

Kids- ""EEEEEEWWWWWW, you're grabbing them with your HANDS!?""

Me- ""Yeah, you mean like this?""

-I then grab the most massive handful of crickets I can just to freak them out, and when I pull my hand out, there are dozens of the little guys oozing down my wrist with one leaping straight out at them.

But then her mom looks up and thanks me, saying I did exactly what I should have. I still felt bad though, so when those kids were innocently looking at an iguana a bit later, I tried to show them I'm not just some evil, all-powerful master of cricket legions.

Drunken_Black_Belt,92,,110,17k8ms,,376,"Hello one and all! Recently I've been receiving a lot of messages asking for tales from my days as a security guard at the two amusement parks I worked at, and my time working in a psych hospital.  I would love to tell these tales but don't know an appropriate subreddit yet. So for now I'll stick with my LP stories here, which as sadly starting to dwindle.  But today's tale is about two mischievous young scamps, and their quest to acquire some video games without paying for them.


It was a slow, hazy afternoon in my part of the country.  I was working for a blue shirted electronic retailer, and having a bad day.  See, in the summer time, I don't like AC. I'd rather drive with the windows, and sunroof open, enjoying the air.  So I tended to keep my windows and sunroof cracked open a bit when I parked for long periods.  This afternoon, mother nature decided to take a shit on me, and it rained, for all of 3 minutes, with a torrential downpour.  Naturally, by the time I got relief from my station, and my car keys, the rain had abated, leaving me with a slightly soaked car interior, a shit ton of humidity, and a bright shining sun that seemed to be a giant middle finger right in my face.

So naturally, I was looking to improve my mood.  Well, I must have done something right in a past life, because my opportunity presented itself shortly after.  Being a slow day, I was following the few customers in the store, not really paying attention to them, if I'm being honest.  But when I switched to the camera that watched the video game aisles,  I noticed two young kids, with a stack of games in their hands.  They weren't too old, maybe 10 and 8.  Obviously brothers, and from the way they were whispering to each other, and darting glances around the store, it was obvious they were up to something. Most of you, I am sure, are aware that most games in these stores have plastic security cases around them, supposedly to deter thieves.  Though I've seen them removed easier than a repressed catholic school girls panties during her first week of college.

Anyways, next to the regular, ""secure"" games, is usually a bargain rack or bin.  Cheap $10 and $20 games, usually pretty shitty.  But sometimes you can find some gems in there.  Well these boys had searched and found a few apparently. Each kid had about 3 or 4 games in his hand. I watched them move to a remote corner of the store, and begin to unwrap the games.  Hands shaking, they removed the plastic, and stashed it in a laptop bag.  They quickly peeked inside of the game case, verifying their treasure was indeed inside.  Once the first game was free from is cellophane prison, the boys quickly liberated the rest of the games.  Each case getting stripped of its binding quicker. Their hands learning and becoming more deft with each progression.  It reminded me of learning, as a younger man, to remove a woman's bra with one hand.  First time is always a fucking disaster, an impenetrable Fort Knox protecting those glorious mounds that feel like a bag of sand. But soon you learn and it's almost as easy as snapping your finger, like a reject back up from West Side Story.

At this point, I made everyone with a radio aware of what was going on, but told them we were just going to fuck with these kids.  I had the computer supervisor walk over to the aisle they were in.  The two young lads scampered off as soon as they saw the blue movement of a scratchy polo being warn by some one making minimum wage.  Next stop was apparently appliances.  I could see the two young men conversing in hushed tones.

""Why brother,"" said Boy 1, ""It seems to me, without much forethought, that we could stash the wrappings of our contraband in this here refrigeration box.  Then we can take this disk containing games of video back to our domicile and spend many an hour together rejoicing in our conquest!""

""Splendid!"" cried Boy 2 ""Let us at once good sir.""

Well at least that's how they sounded in my head.  For some reason, they decided to throw the case, AND THE GAME, in the fridge. They did this not once, but 3 times.  Then they wandered off to the music section, and watched the appliance aisle.  My guess is they wanted to see how often people checked before actually removing the games from the cases.  And this is where things get interesting.

An older black woman walks up behind them.  She apparently scared the crap out of them, and they all began to talk. Now this woman seemed like she had just gotten back from church.  She looked like an extra from Big Momma's house. One of those little old ladies who stops to talk to Martin Lawrence and then isn't seen again.  She was pointing at the games remaining in their hand, and shaking her head no.  She led them over to the video game aisle to have them put them back on the shelves.  With a forlorn glance at the appliance aisle, they followed, dutifully.  That is when the fuckery began on my part.  I had our appliance manager go to the three fridges containing games, and remove the disks from the cases, and leave the cases in the fridges.  She brought the disks over to me, and I smiled a devious smile, like a guy who is stuck in an crowded elevator with the boss he hates, and releases a smelly, yet silent fart of quiet revenge.

Eventually, released from authoritative grip of their grandmother, the two boys return to the appliance section, and begin to go for their main target.  I wish I could accurately describe the look on their faces as they opened the Fridgidaire, reached in to open the game case, only to discover its empty.  A look of pure joy , slowly morphing into a look of utter complexity.  I imagine its like being handed your child after your wife gives birth, only to discover that it has both sets of genitalia on it.

The boys looked around in a panic, and quickly abandoned the cases and walked over to the home theater section.  Sitting on two giant leather chairs, the two boys held secretive conferences.  Clearly the message had been sent, and I could rest easy knowing two little shits had been taken down a couple of pegs.  But NOPE. One of the boys quickly ran back to the game aisle, picked up two of the games their grandmother had made them put back, and returned to the chair.  He removed the two disks, and handed them to his brother, who quickly place them under the chair.  Then the first brother went and put the cases back into the game aisle. 

Naturally I raised the Theater supervisor on the radio, and he agreed that an impromptu changing of the furniture in his department was a good idea.  So he and the biggest guy in the store, proceeded to shift around couches and chairs.  Eventually they reached the chairs where the two boys sat.  The Supervisor, knowing a bit of fuckery himself, held down his radio so all could hear the conversation.

Supe: Hey guys, we're moving furniture, would you mind letting us just place these chairs over there?  Then you can have them back.

The boys shared a glance with each other, the horror apparent in their eyes.  Yes boys. You were stupid before, then you went full retard.

You never go full retard.  (Shout out to Robert Downy Jr.)

Supe: Hey guys cmon it'll take two seconds. I know they are comfy, but I'll make sure you get them back.

Boy 1: Umm.. Our grandma told us to wait here. We aren't allowed to move.

Supe: I'll tell her I ok'd it.  Or stand here and we'll bring a couch over for you.

The two boys got up and STOOD THERE, as the supervisor picked up the chair, spotted the two games, and picked them up after putting the chair down.

Supe: Oh hey these weren't yours were they? Fell out of your pocket?  No? Sorry, we get people trying to steal this stuff all the time,  someone must have left it here. 

The two boys acted suprised, as if anyone would actually steal.  That was just unthinkable, and wrong.  They decided then that an area that had been host to criminals, was surely no place that they wanted to be, lest they tarnish their purity, and quickly left the area.  At this point, everyone on the radio is laughing, or trying not to laugh while dealing with customers.  My manager comes up and I tell him I'm gonna make sure they understand. He gives a nod and goes out and gets all the games and cases and brings them up to me.  Now the boys didn't remove anything from the store, so legally, I wasn't allowed to do what I did next. But fuck them. I'm awesome.

After several more minutes, the boys find their grandmother who had just finished her purchases, and they head towards the door. I ask the sweet old lady for her receipt, and ask her if she has a minute.  She says yes, and I pull her aside, with her two rapscallions in tow.  

Me: ""Ma'm are these your grandsons?""

Madea: Why yes they are. Is there a problem?

Me: Well, Ma'm I apologize if this seems rude, but it appears they were attempting to remove some video games from the store without purchasing them.

Madea: What? How dare you accuse them of stealing?  We just got back from church!  These are good boys!

Me: I'm sure they are.  And I don't normally say anything or act unless they have removed something from the store, but I figured this is something you'd want to know about.  If you don't believe me, I have it all on video and can show you, so you can talk to them

After much hooting and hollering about how I'm racist, and it's hard enough for young black boys growing up without the white man putting them down, she agrees to watch the video.  She sees everything unfold, and the stare she gave her boys would make Hitler hug a Jew just to make it stop.  She turned to me, apologized profusely, and assured me she would take care of it.  At this point we were in my office, and she asks if she can have a moment alone with her grandsons.  I agreed and closed the door behind me.  The smacks were audible, even though she was screaming at them full force. A minute later the ruckus died, and they walked out, quietly, into the sweltering day.

Hello everyone. I've been lurking for a while and I figured I would share some of my experiences in the wonderful world of retail.

A word of warning: ACHTUNG!

And a now few more: If you are in a hurry, your mom has asked you twice already to mow the lawn, or you are on the toilet thinking ""just one more post and then I'll get back to work"", I urge you to save this for later, it is quite long.

Oh and also if you are at any point offended by incorrect use of gay, lesbian, bi, transgender, straight, lgbt or anything else for that matter, I apologize in advance. I am pretty liberal when it comes to the use of these words, that does not mean I don't know how other people feel about this.

Now then, let's get to it! I work at a gay bar. The only gay bar in fact in a 70 km radius, that's 43.5 miles for the Americans and 37.8 nautical miles for the sailors.

This is a pretty small bar, I'd say you could fit about 60 people in there, but there would be some sore toes and bruised elbows in the morning. Because the bar is so small and it's a long way to the next gay bar, it was decided that we would host big parties every month at a separate location.

In 2008 I started working at the bar. I started out as a lowly bartender, I then begun to bartend at the parties, soon I became a shift manager both at the bar and parties, then on to further fame as a manager of the bar and in the end I moved on to being in charge of planning and hosting the parties. 

It was a swift climb through the ranks and I would be lying if I said I didn't leave some sore souls in my wake. However I was never in it for the power, I just worked hard and people recognized that.

Now that my life story is done, I would like to tell you about some of the people that come to the bar. Some regulars, and just some general types of people.

The Regulars:

note: I call our regulars by their standard orders. I am terrible with names and faces, so describing someone to a coworker can be difficult. Thus simply stating ""you know, coke in a glass with lime was in here earlier asking for you"" is much easier.

**Pilsner and a Glass:** This is a 60 year old, slightly overweight guy trolling for young meat. And when I say young, I mean young! He will sniff out any guy who's hardly told ma and pa about his new found love of sausage yet, and viciously attack with offers of drinks and a ride home.

There are plenty of these kind of guys around, but what makes this specimen interesting is, he never scores. I have worked at that bar for five years. I have seen even the most hopeless cases get lucky once in a while, but Pilsner and a glass? Never!

You would think he would try for something else sometime, but no, he is determined. Poor sod.

**Double Scotch and Coke:** This guy never gets anything else, never! We have a few of those people, those who will get the same thing every time. Good on them, they know what they like. But this guy, he messes with one of my pet peeves. 

You see I can't stand it when people call Jack Daniels scotch. Why? Because it's wrong, that's why! You know why it's called a scotch? BECAUSE IT'S FROM SCOTLAND! Where is Jack Daniels from? Tennessee! Is Tennessee in Scotland? NO! So don't call it a scotch!

But this guy INSISTS on saying ""a double scotch and coke"". And every time I ask him ""Jack Daniels?"" and he reples ""yes"".
I have tried to explain, kindly, jokingly, even slightly annoyed, but it doesn't work. 

So one day, when he wasn't looking, I made his drink with actual scotch and he actually did a spit-take! I have never seen anyone else do that, ever. But he did it and he looked at me with disbelief and tears in his eyes and choked out ""This coke's gone bad!"". Sigh... 

That was a couple of regulars, I have many more if you would like to hear about them.

Now for the types. I would very much like to tell you about a specific type of people. **The straight guys**, or the lads. 

The straight guys are a group of 3-6 guys out on the town. They're at the sports bar around the corner and have already had a few rounds. As they are sitting there talking up their egos by counting just how many girls they've banged this past week, one of them speaks up 

**Lad#1:** ""You know what we should do? You fucking know what we should do? You know that fag place around the corner? yeah? We should go there and scare some queers!""

**Lad#2:** ""Fuck yeah! Let's bash some stinking fags!""

**Lad#3:** ""Let's do this!""

So they drink up and, egging each other on, almost run out of the sports bar. They walk briskly towards the corner, but the minute they round it, they slow down. They begin to think, individually, that maybe this isn't such a good idea. But they can't let their mates know, so they keep on walking.

In the end they make it to the door, and one of them pushes out his chest and goes for the handle. They walk in, looking around shyly. 

They have entered a gay bar, this is unknown territory and must be surveyed carefully. ""Oh god I hope no one sees me in here"" thinks one, another ""Oh god I hope no one hits on me"" and maybe the third lad thinks to himself ""That guy's kinda cute"".

When they have entered the bar there are, in my experience, three possible outcomes:

**1:** They are aggressive and antagonizing, may even end up throwing a punch before they are kicked out.

**2:** They are aggressive and antagonizing, until one of them spots the big bowl of free condoms. They each grab a handful and leave quickly, looking both ways to see no one saw them.

**3:** My personal favorite. They are a bit uncomfortable, but one of them declares ""This seems like a nice place"" and buys a round for his mates. They usually sit at the bar and you get a good talk. They may even come back once in a while just because they like the atmosphere.

There are a million types; The bears, the powder puffs, the faghags, the straight girls, the baby dykes, the alternatives, the fazes and so many more.

zuizide,31,,66,19wtlk,,381,"Since yesterdays story of my current situation was so well received, I decided to share my all time favorite.

I lived in a not so great part of town that only had one 24/7/365 gas station for miles, so needless to say, I frequented that place. I kept on running into the owner there in the middle of the night so eventually I asked him why in the world an owner would work overnights. He told me that he couldn't find anyone willing to work overnight that didn't rob him blind with free smokes, blunts, candy/snack and drinks (beer mostly). I offered my services up and told him a little about myself, the next night I started with a promise to him I would work EVERY night shift for him from then on. He paid me well and with the 16 hours of OT every week, it was a great opportunity for me. Within the first month his loss went down over 80% he claimed, I was proud of that and he compensated me well.

So one fine evening I was really slow, it was probably about 2am or so and during the week there really wasn't much activity from 2-4am. I'm standing outside having a smoke when I notice a very large black guy riding a small girls bicycle in my direction. It had the pink streamers on the handlebars and everything, even a bright pink banana seat. It made me laugh at the mere sight of it, but I figured he would be coming into the store to buy something so I went in and went behind the counter. When he got there, he came in and looked at me and said, ""I'M ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY!"" He was pretty scary looking to younger me, a guy about a foot taller and easily 100 pounds heavier, with about 0% body fat. This guy was pure muscle, you could see the definition in his arms along with some veins considering he was wearing a plain white wife beater. Instantly though, I could tell he was coming down off a crack binge (sweaty as hell when it wasn't that hot out, eyes darting all over, mouth and tongue making erratic movements and kinda foaming a bit), so I figured what the hell, let's have some fun. So I told him, ""So am I man! That's what they pay me for, to watch over the money at night!"" He said, ""NO NO NO, YOU DON'T GET IT MAN. I'M ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY!"" I said, ""Me too man, I just told you that's what I'm paid for. To collect and count the money for the owner!"" This went on for about 2-3 minutes, us going back and forth telling each other how we were all about DAT MONEY. Eventually, he just said, ""AW SHIT, NEVERMIND MAN."" And then he left.

That's when it hit me. That bastard was trying to rob me! So I went out to my car after scanning the parking lot for him (and noticing he was riding off on that cute pink bike) and grabbed my trusty .380 from under the seat. I put it in the small of my back and covered it with my shirt and headed back inside. When I got close to the door I heard, ""HEY! HEY MAN!"" so I turned around and there he was again about 20 feet from me. I hurried inside and behind the counter where I put the gun on a ledge under the counter and kept my hand close to it. He comes in the store and says, ""DID YOU CALL DEM BOYS?!"" So I played dumb and said, ""What boys man? What is wrong with you?"" He said, ""DA PO LICE, DID YOU CALL EM?!"" I just looked at him and said, ""Why the hell would I call the police?"" That's when he said, ""Well I wanted da money and you wouldn't give it up so I figgaed you called dem boys on me."" I just looked at him and said, ""Seriously, you were trying to rob me? I didn't even realize."" The next thing shocked the shit out of me because by now I was trying to deal with the fact that I would probably have to shoot someone that night, and I really didn't want to. ""I'm sorry man, I just need to get like $20 or so, I REALLY NEED IT."" I told him I was sorry that I couldn't help him out with any money, but if he wanted someone to chill with while he came down, I would sit and talk with him. He said ok, as long as I didn't call the cops or shoot him (apparently he noticed me getting my gun). So I left the gun in the store and sat outside with him smoking cigarettes until the urge for more crack wore off. During that time, he kept on apologizing to me telling me he wasn't like that at all when he was sober and he regretted even trying. Although he was shocked that it didn't work. At one point he asked me why I wasn't scared of him when he first came in, according to him he ""could have had a gun."" I told him it was very unlikely that he had a gun because he smokes crack. He looked confused and asked what I meant by that, so I explained to him, ""If you had a gun at some point, you would have traded it for more crack to your dealer instead of using it to rob someone."" Eventually he told me he was feeling better and not fiending for more crack, he hopped on that pink girls bicycle and rode off into the night. I never called the cops or told my boss, and I never saw him again.

**TL;DR I almost got robbed and joked around with the robber and then gave him smokes and company while the urge for more crack subsided.**","Yo man, I'm all about dat money!",447,talesFromRetail
Bravesfan417,104,,87,1mvfv6,,376,"I had just commented before about only have two weeks left to work at my old store before I had moved to a different one. I never told anybody the story of why I put in my two weeks notice though. As much crap as I had to sustain while at my job with Mike, I liked quite a few of the customers, I liked some of the other employees, and even though Mike would dictate what I would do for the day, normally with lots of yelling, once I got my assignment, I pretty much did what I wanted while doing my job. But what happened in this next story, just made me lose it, and blow up on Mike like I had never done before.

I was working on a Saturday, and we were busy. I was running between bagging and service desk. I clocked in at 9 in the morning as a stocker, but for some reason, this Saturday was like the 2-3 days before Thanksgiving (massively busy. Almost double the sales for any grocery store). We have checkers on every lane, going as fast as they can. As soon as I bag one order, I'm off to the next register. See somebody at the service desk? I'm off to there now.

About 1:00 in the afternoon, my parents come in to do some shopping. I say hi and wave to them as I'm bagging the order closest to the door. They wave, say hi, and go about their way through the store. I'm still running back and forth, and there's finally a lull in the action. I let all four of the checkers know that I'm headed out to the parking lot to bring all the carts in, and if somebody is needed for the service desk, call for a manager.

I go outside, and as expected, people have left carts all over the parking lot. I grab all the ones from by the building, and take those in first. I go throughout the parking lot, and grab all carts that aren't in the cart coral, and take those back in to the store. I'm on my way back out and I'm lining up all the carts that are in the coral, and I see somebody run up to me out of the corner of my eye. I turn around, and it's one of our checkers. They never abandon their registers when it's this busy, so I know that something is wrong.

Checker: Bravesfan417, you've gotta come inside quick.

Me: Just lemme get these carts really quick and I'll be in. Big rush up front?

Checker: Not really... We had to call a manager up front, but ""Tony"" (the other manager who was in at that time during the day) is at lunch, so we had to call Mike to the service desk.

Me: Ok... Mike can handle the service desk himself. I have my own job.

Checker: He's blowing up on the customers... You better come inside.

For those of you who haven't read any past stories, everybody in our store would bow down to anything that Mike said, and nobody would stick up to him. Save for two people. Myself, and Sweetpea, our dear sweet office manager. 

I walk back inside, furious with Mike. I know that he told me he was ""busy"", and that I needed to run the front and keep everything in line so that he could do what he was supposed to do. (I believe it had something to do with orders, but it's not really important).

I see Mike at the service desk laying in to some customers, and they both look familiar. I see their basket. I see the food that they've bought, and I see the man's cane. Not just any man's cane. No. My dad's cane. Mike is laying in to both of my parents about how he's so important that he can't be bothered to help them, and that, ""If Bravesfan417 wasn't so incapable of doing his job, then I wouldn't have to be up here doing this. I don't even know why I keep him around."" Somehow, this moron doesn't know that these are my parents.

They just wanted to rent a movie. They had everything ready. All Mike had to do was scan their card, scan the movie, grab it, and take their money. That's all. But no, he's yelling at them about how they're inconveniencing him, and that he doesn't see why he should have to deal with people who aren't ""normal"".

For those of you who don't know, my dad has Parkinson's Disease and he has to walk with a cane. And apparently walking with a cane makes you ""not normal"". I got pissed. I don't care if somebody wants to insult me or whatever. But I don't care who you are, you don't talk bad about my family. My mom looks like she's about to cry, and my dad looks like somebody had kicked his dog. It was on now.

Me: What did you just say, Mike?

Mike: Good! You're here! Now help them!

Me: No... I asked you a question. What did you just say?

Mike: Did you just tell me that you weren't going to do something?

Me: Yeah, I did. Now tell me what you said about how you shouldn't have to help people that weren't ""normal""?

Mike: Just that! He's not normal! Now help them!

Me: No! First off you narcissistic asshole, just because he uses a cane, doesn't mean he's not normal. Second, these are my parents, so I can't help them anyway. So I'm going to let you apologize before I flip a lid.

Mike: I'll let you help them this time. Now do it, I have other stuff to do!

Me: Yeah, I'll do it right after I call corporate and let my parents talk to them. You're a prick. I wouldn't even care if these weren't my parents, you don't go around talking to people like that. Yeah, he uses a cane to walk. You know why? Because he has Parkinson's. Now I'm going to tell you one last time. Apologize. Now.

Mike: (As he starts heading on his way out from behind the service desk) You can't tell me what to do. I'm your boss.

Me: (I walk in front of the entrance behind the counter so that I'm blocking his path from getting out. Mike has about 4-5 inches on me, and near 100 lbs. This isn't something that I'd win if push came to shove) You're not going anywhere until you apologize. And I mean it Mike. Do it now, or shits gonna get hairy around here, and you don't want to be around me when I get that pissed.

Mike: (Shoves me out of the way) I'd like to see you do something.

Me: Fine. Go to the back, just wait and see what happens.

I walk behind the counter and grab the phone. Mike is watching me, and I dial the number for corporate.

*Ringing* This is (insert store name here) main office. This is (insert secretary name here), how may I help you.

Me: Yeah, this is Bravesfan417 at store 7. I need to talk to (insert head bosses name here) about our boss Mike.

Secretary: If you have a complaint, you'll need to go through the proper channels.

Me: No. I'm not hanging up until I talk to (insert bosses name here). If I go through the proper channels, they won't get it at corporate because Mike is a prick. Now i want to talk to (boss) now.

Secretary: Bravesfan417! That is not language that we --

I look up, Mike had pushed down the button on the base so that the phone hung up.

Mike: In my office. Now.

Me: No. Back of the store. I don't want any of our customers to hear what I have to say to you.

I look at my parents and tell them that I'll bring that movie on my way home and to just go ahead and check out.

Mike and I walk back to the back where our produce manager, receiving coordinator, and a couple other employees are, and I just reached boiling point.

Me: What the hell is wrong with you? My dad is two times the man you are and could ever hope to be! I hope you burn in hell you ass!

Mike: I hope you don't want this job much longer! Talking to me like that is a one-way ticket to being fired!

Me: Fine! Consider this my two weeks notice! You know how many times you've threatened to fire me and never done it, Mike?? Wonder why that is? Could it be because I do way more than what is in my job description? Is it because I listen to what all the customers actually think of you? Is it because I clean up your messes? You're an arrogant son of a bitch, why don't you go do us all a favor and go play inside the balor?!?

Mike: (Takes a step towards me to try to intimidate me, I'm too pissed that it doesn't work) Why don't you go ahead and try to do something?? Because you can't! You're weak, and you'll never be able to do anything about it!

Me: See, Mike... It goes like this. You'll be getting boned by the devil for eternity. Like I said, this is my two weeks notice. Oh, by the way, I'm starting my week of vacation tomorrow. I'll come back for my last week, but I'd like to see how much I actually do. Suck my dick. Learn some manners, and never... And I mean never, talk to my parents like that again. You do that, and I'll punch you in the fucking throat.

I storm out of the back, clock out, go to the store across town and ask the manager for a job. He notices my uniform, and asks if I still work over there. I said that I just put in my two weeks notice and I couldn't stand working for Mike anymore. He tells me that I can start the day after my last day at my old store.

I walk back out to my car, and notice that I have 5 calls from the store along with 5 voicemails, I listen to them, and they're all variations of ""Get back to the store, now!"" I went back to the store, and got the other manager up to the front to rent me that movie.

Mike walks up front as I'm checking the movie out and says that I can't do that on the clock.

Me: I'm not on the clock, but even if I was on the clock, I'd do this!

I flip him the bird, grab my movie, and walk out. I got home, called corporate and demanded to talk to the main boss. I leave a message, and never heard anything about it. I doubt they delivered it to them.

Even typing this story gets my blood boiling. I can't believe that a person can be this much of a dick. I apologize for any course language in the post or in any past posts. Typing about Mike makes me want to punch something, but I have to control my anger.

skunkhairjones,23,,78,1foe5n,,378,"One of the things we install for customers is flooring. The process is pretty simple: get measured, build quote, pay, carpet is ordered and shipped to the installers, installers schedule install. Done. One of the key components to ensure nothing goes wrong is great follow up and communication with the customers. I was always confident my team did an excellent job of doing just that.

So, a customer had just gotten measured and paid for a pretty large order for a home. He's being stationed here in the D.C. area and needed the carpet installed by a certain day before the movers arrived. We charge for furniture moving so he saved several hundred dollars by having no furniture. Well, between the measure time and the sold time he decided to remove a 4ft wall that divided the room thinking it would have no impact on how the carpet is installed. Unfortunately, it did have a big impact on how the carpet is laid and how much is needed. We had to cancel his original order and for liability and warranty reasons we had to remeasure. Now his install date is pushed back closer to his deadline. 

Carpet is reordered and two days later the carpet mill informs us because of the substantial size they didn't have enough carpet from one single dye-lot. They would have to obtain it from a mill further west. Again, delaying the install date. Only this time it pushed the install date past the date his furniture and rest of his family arrived. Apologizing profusely, I checked daily for the status of his carpet and would keep him updated. He was understandably upset and wasn't sure if he should postpone his movers. He couldn't postpone his family arriving though. It was cool, because he was angry and I guess he had hard time channeling it because he knew it wasn't our fault. He remained calm and understanding the entire time.

Fast forward a week and his carpet is on track to ship as expected. That is until the mid-west got slammed with super blizzards, right where the carpet mill is located. Trucks couldn't get in or out. At this point I really don't know what to do, completely afraid this guy is going to go completely livid. I can't contact anyone at the mill because they shut it down due to weather. I finally give the customer a call and explain the situation. He laughs, like he has just gone insane. He explains to me he had to pay a fee to postpone his movers and isn't going to postpone them again. His family is currently sleeping on air mattresses. He is extremely angry, but tells me he knows it's not mine or my store's fault. Everyone at the store has been helpful as could be and he just has shitty luck. 

It's really these types of customers I go completely out of my way for. I feel bad, they understand that not everything is the store's or the employee's fault. The entire time he hasn't asked for any compensation, because he feels he hasn't been wronged by the store. 

Finally, his carpet is dug out of the snow and is headed to the installers. Typically an install date isn't scheduled until the installers have the carpet, but I tried to pull some strings with our installers to get it done as soon as possible. It was a busy season and the installers couldn't fit him anywhere because of the scope of his job. It would require another customer canceling or voluntarily rescheduling their install date. 

I pleaded to the installer supervisor and explained the situation the customer has already been through with his family and movers. He said he would see what he could do. Three days until the movers arrive I'm already talking with management on offering compensation even though he hasn't asked for any. I get a call from the installers, he had called up a few customers who he had felt were flexible with the install date and actually asked if they would be willing to reschedule to accommodate my customer. 

The stars were aligning. His carpet was scheduled to arrive to the installers that day, the newly opened slot could get him installed the next day, and his movers would arrive on the third. 

After all that happened he praised me and my team for being diligent on his order. He never felt abandoned by the store. 

We ended up discounting his order the fees he paid the movers for postponing in addition to several hundred dollars off of his carpet for the delays. And the install went smoothly, his family only had to endure a 5 days of sleeping on air mattresses. I felt pretty accomplished. ","If it could go wrong, it went wrong.

NightMgr,8,,80,1ag8ha,,373,"This story is from long ago in the early 1980s.

A friend of mine worked in a record store.  Really records- this happened before cds!

He was a music education major in about to start his final semester.  A man came in asking for a particular album, and my buddy told him, ""If you like that kind of thing, check this out....""  He showed him other music based on his taste.  This one has the same horn section- this one has the same producer, this one sounds similar.  But, the guy walked out with 10 albums.

A week later, the man returns.  He tells my buddy he owns a small computer company.  Small computers for offices are a pretty new thing.  He explains even if he hires people with computer degrees, they don't know these products.  He has to train everyone, and he's always looking for smart people.  

So, he makes my buddy an offer: he'll make more his first year than a music teacher would make after ten.  And he doesn't have to finish his degree.

So this got my buddy into computer support on the ground level.  He eventually went to work for IBM and he retired with a nice severance a couple of years ago- and went right back and finished his music degree and is an assistant director at his local HS.  

Another bonus about going back to school after 25 years is some of his friends are now college music directors.  He's on a full scholarship for his master's degree since he had been college roommates with a university department head.

Manda-182,61,,81,18sh0o,,374,"I work at a fairly large company, ends with Max and we sell office supplies and more...yeah.. so,

I was at work a few days ago when I had some projects to do on the computer, where we do most of our ordering, prints for customers who can't make it into the store, and emailing. Anyway, I want the customers to know I am there when I am at the computer, so I usually turn the screen and my chair so my face faces the front so I can see when they walk up. In addition to this, I also move one of the signs we have sitting on the counter so I am fully visible. 

A woman walks up to the counter, and RIGHT before I was about to say hello and greet her, without taking a SECOND to see if someone is here, she turns around and SCREAMS...""EXCUUUUSE MEEE?!?????"" towards the front. I was like ""Woah! Ma'am, I'm right here.."" And she was like ""oh."" Like it's necessary to scream throughout the whole store to the front to get someone to the back of the store (walk up to the front, why do you have to SCREAM?) Anyways, she was a horrible customer to help.

She brings me a 250 page booklet and wants me to print 6 copies. Okay, no big deal, that's 1500 copies, I will have her come back in an hour. This is how the conversation went.

Me: okay ma'am I have started your copies, and can I have your phone number to call you when it's done?
Her: no I want it right now.
Me: You want 6 copies, of this very large booklet, it will take some time but you can wait if you'd like.
Her: of course I will wait, where are your chairs at!?
Me: In the furniture section, at the front...
Her: I WILL WAIT THERE THEN.

She then sat in a chair up front and STARED at me until I told her she was all set. She came to pay for it and said, ""oh I have another thing."" ...At this point I am like okay, fine, what could be worse? She hands me a paper with typed information on it, and wants me to change the information on it. The only way I could do this, is if I photoshop it and try to match the font (because she had a hard copy, not a digital one) and to do this, we have to charge a little over a dollar per minute and she has to sit and wait again. When I told her this she said ""IT WILL ONLY TAKE 30 SECONDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"" I told her this was the policy and that's what happens when you have a hard copy. 

She stormed off and while she was walking away she said she would take it to our competitor store. Luckily I have connections there as well and I called and asked them if they did her service for her, which they told me they could not.

If you have a question about iguanas, they call me. If you have a question about dog allergies, they call me. If you have a question about which minerals are in reptile sand versus standard aquarium sand, they call me.

Saturday afternoons are by far the busiest time of week, and we're usually staffed with a few people over on the animal side of the store to help out customers who are taking the plunge into a new pet. One of those people called in this day, so I'm just about the only person to help all the customers who end up in long interactions as I go through the entire lecture about how to maintain an animal.

Then comes in a family all wearing sweaters indicating they were from the ""snobby"" suburb immediately west of run-down suburb my store is in. I like these customers because usually they've got money and are willing to put in more than the bare minimum. I also dislike these customers because they tend to always know what's best, and reek with the smell of undeserved entitlement. The mother of the family flags me down.

Different Turtle Lady: *in hysterics* ""I need stuff for a turtle!""  
Me: ""Alright, where are we starting. Do you have a tank?""  
DTL: ""No! Get me the right tank!""  
Me: ""We have two options, either a 40 gal...""  
DTL: ""Just get me the best one for it!""  

I grab one of our bigger carts and then proceed to load a 40 gallon tank into it. This is never an easy task. They are 50 pounds of extremely fragile awkward clunkiness. 

DTL: ""Are you sure that's big enough!""  
Me: ""It's the most appropriate tank we have for a full grown turtle.""  
DTL: ""I want that one!"" *points at the tank we keep our turtles in*  
Me: ""Well, the 'tank' part of that is 120 gallons. We don't carry those.""  
DTL: ""What do you mean you don't carry those, there's one right there!"" *points again to our turtle habitat.*  
Me: ""I can't sell you that. That's a store fixture.""  
DTL: ""Why do you have it in the store if you don't sell it. Every other store sells their floor models! I want that one right there and I'm not leaving until I get it.""

Her family has abandoned her at this point.  

Me: ""Ma'am, this is where we keep our turtles. The ones we intend to sell. Giving you this would be like selling you the shelves or the safe. It's not going to happen.""  
DTL: ""Where can I get one?""  
Me: ""These are $4000 commercial installations. If you really want I can give information on the manufacturer.""  
DTL: ""Why don't you just sell me that one?""  
Me: ""Not only is it not for sale, it is directly attached to our store's water system. It would require hiring a plumber to take it out. If you were to go home with this we'd have 6 turtles without a proper habitat.""  
DTL: ""Then call a fucking plumber!""  
Me: ""I don't know how many times I have to tell you this. *I can not, by any stretch of the imagination sell you this. It is impossible for at least a dozen reasons.*""   
DTL: *hyperventilating* ""THEN WHY DO YOU SELL THE DAMN TURTLES IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO SELL THE TANK THEY NEED. WHAT SORT OF CRUEL COMPANY IS THIS? THERE WAS A POOR TURTLE IN MY BACK YARD AND WE NEED TO GET IT OUT OF THE COLD. WINTER IS ONLY 4 MONTHS AWAY THIS POOR THING WON'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THAT.""  
Me: ""There's a reason that turtle was outside. He can withstand the winter. We never suggest taking in an animal you found outside.""  
DTL: ""SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BOUGHT HIM AND PUT HIM IN OUR BACK YARD. HOW IRRESPONSIBLE ARE YOU -*shoves finger in my face*- FOR SELLING THESE IF PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO GET RID OF THEM""

Apparently there aren't turtles in Minnesota. The only possible conclusion is that somebody bought one from a pet store and dumped it in her back yard. Also, she obviously wasn't going to appreciate the fact she just logically destroyed the entire pet industry. It was at this point her husband comes over and escorts her out of the store giving me a look that read ""I'm so sorry.""

About 15 minutes later she comes back in and tells me she'll take the 40 gallon, then all the gizmos actually needed for it. When she was leaving she sneered ""Thanks for nothing.""

[deleted],25,,66,1idvkj,,379,"Background: I work as an assistant manager in one of the largest, upscale liquor stores in my state.

Saturday, the day before yesterday, was particularly busy; even for a Saturday at a liquor store. I was about 7 and a half hours into a 9 hour shift, and had not yet had time to eat lunch or use the restroom; I had just been too busy. By this time I desperately needed to void my bladder. There's a slight lull in the store, so I take the opportunity and am moving toward our restrooms at the quickest speed I can muster while still maintaining an air of professionalism. A man calls out 

""Excuse me! Miss!""

""I'll be with you in a moment, sir,"" and I walk into the bathroom. Ours is not a single toilet water-closet, we have four stalls and a couple sinks; I couldn't lock the door behind me. I didn't even make it into a stall before the man walks into the bathroom behind me. The woman washing her hands at the sink, a regular of ours, stops moving and just stares at him in the mirror. 

""Miss! I need your help picking a wine out for dinner tonight. We're having chicken.""

""As I told you, sir, I will be with you in a moment."" 

""Ok.""

And he stood there. Expectantly. The woman is still standing there, her hands under the running water, not moving, just staring at him. 

I try to remain calm as I say ""Sir, if you could wait outside, please?""

""What?""

All of a sudden the woman at the sink slams the water off, turns around and says ""Dude, get the fuck out of the ladies room and find someone else to help you!""

At this point it seems to dawn on him that he's crossed a line and he makes a hasty exit. I turn to thank her and she says ""I tried to work retail once, but I couldn't handle assholes like that. How long before you start... med school, wasn't it?"" ""Yes, ma'am. Too long."" ""Yeah, I hear ya. Good luck, sweetie,"" and she walked out.

Kooma9,48,,70,1j3zkr,,377,"Hello TFR! I love this subreddit, and even though I’ve only been in retail a short time now, I finally have my own story worth sharing after all my lurking.

During the week I work on a university campus from nine to five, and pickup extra shifts at a burger place on the weekends. It’s not a fast food joint; we cook everything to order and use better quality ingredients. The food’s comparable to that place with the specific number of guys. I work the register for extra rent money.

Anyway, after work on the weekdays, I usually stop by the restaurant to grab some delicious employee-discounted dinner. So I stop by, say “hi” to the gang, place my usual order and grab a seat by the TV. One of the cashiers for today is late so it’s just the Shift Manager (SM) working the front. Normally things aren’t busy around now so this isn’t a problem. Then right after I place my order a small rush happens. I think to myself, “Well, that’s not fun for SM but we need the business on weekdays.” and go back to pretending I care about baseball.

“Excuse me!” in that tone of voice that is 100% command.

Now, my first thought on hearing that is that someone’s getting impatient with being third in line, so I turn around to find myself staring into the eyes of one very pissed off woman. A little confused I ask, “Um, is something wrong?”
Her: “Yeah something’s wrong! You’re sitting here on your ass instead of doing your job! There are people her waiting so quit doing nothing on your little break and take my order!”

About now is when I recognize this woman. I’d taken her order before, I made a mistake and she’d stared daggers at me while I got it fixed for her. Suffice it to say I stick out from the rest of the cashiers so she can probably recognize me even if I’m not wearing any part of my uniform. My guess is she remembered me and can hold a grudge.

Me: “Uh, ma’am, I’m not working today. I actually can’t use the register. If you just wait a few minutes SM can take care of you.”

Apparently, she did not like this answer, because she spent the next three minutes berating me for being a lazy fatass (I’m 5’10” and weight 125 lbs, so I found this a perplexing insult) and how the food here was too expensive and she should be treated much better as a customer and she would make sure I was fired for this and on and on you know this song and dance by now.

Meanwhile SM is finishing with a customer while hearing everything she’s spewing and I can just see him getting stone-faced trying to contain his anger. You see, SM is a bro. Not the kind of bro you normally think of, he’s a guy who honestly believes in brotherhood. Around this time, my order pops up in the sell window so he politely asks the next customer to hold on for a second so he can deliver it.

SM walks over and puts the bag on my table, “Here’s your order sir. Thanks for being patient. Is this woman bothering you?”

Me: “Yeah, just a little.”

Her: “WHAT! DON’T YOU JUST-”

SM: “Ma’am, you’ve been harassing our customers and I’m going to ask you to leave. If you continue being disruptive to our patrons or staff I will call the police.""

She looked about ready to start another tirade, but thankfully decided to leave in the huffiest of ways she could.

Me and SM watch her leave and proceed to give the customary nods and fist-bumps of solidarity.

tl;dr: Go to my workplace to get dinner; woman was very angry that I would not ring up her order, despite not being on the clock. Awesome shift manager throws her out. Onion rings taste better with justice.

OffWhiteBeige,37,,71,1d0r7w,,374,"I work in a fast food restaurant. 

This story starts with the ""you go first"" dance. This dance is beautiful. Only two people standing in the queue, three or more open tills, but they insist the other person orders first because they are so polite and nice. This seems to slow down service time; the queue will often become longer while no one is being served. Customers behind the dancers find it hard to believe that they can be served right away.

So dancer number one finally decides to approach my till. He shuffles for a few seconds, points at me, then asks ""are you serving?"". I'm not totally sure what people think I stand behind my till for, if it's not for serving, so usually this question is met with a condescending ""yes"".

He then hands me a voucher, telling me he is entitled to a free meal. This voucher is not only for another store, it isn't even for a fast food restaurant. He had a voucher for a half price lunch at a nearby supermarket. I try to explain to him politely that the voucher is for another store and suggest products we sell that are near to the price he would be paying there. He insists that the voucher can be used at any store near the supermarket.

Eventually, he seems to realise that he can't use the voucher at my store. He demands to speak to my manager, then turns round and walks out the store. Lost for words.

I was almost done with my shift, and I saw a woman walking up to the store, leading a horse behind her.

[Here is a picture of the horse](http://imgur.com/k4ZCt), to give you an idea.  Not a huge horse, but he is what is called a miniature horse.

She had brought him in to get weighed on our scale.  He weighs 234 pounds! 

I asked her what the horses name was.  She told me his full name was ""Lucky Stars Major"".  She went on to say that she calls him Major most of the time, but a lot of the kids that the horse meets call him Lucky Stars.  You see, she takes this horse to the children's hospital to meet sick children.

I would try to keep my language as simple as possible and say only the key things. Other times they would have a child with them who would translate and speak for the parent and appeared used to this, they were always darling sweet children. 

Rarely people would get upset with me because I didn't know Spanish. One day a lady came up and started speaking in Spanish sounding very annoyed. I stopped her said I don't speak Spanish, I'm sorry. Instead of letting me try and help her she stormed off. A minute later her husband appeared. He proceeded to yell at me about not knowing Spanish and how I had no right to be working there unless I did. In his words ""This is a Mexican store, not a white girl store."" I didn't realize stores had races but I guess he wants to go back to the time of segregation. My manager at this point decided to care and ask what was up. The man then told her about how I was a horrible employee because I didn't speak Spanish, never mind the fact his wife didn't speak English and yet were in America so if there is one person you are going to get on about not speaking a language perhaps it should be your wife.    

My manager finishes up whatever the issue was. I don't remember what it was, but it was something small. When she finishes the people leave and the first thing she does is turn around and tell me I really should learn Spanish to work at the store. 

I was shocked. At no point has this company ever considered itself bilingual. There was no recommendation to know Spanish at the time of hiring. I told her I was not going to learn Spanish. She told me if I want a future at the store I really needed to. This was a part time high school minimum wage job. This women really expected me to think a minimum wage job in HS was peaking my ambition and I needed to learn another language for it. I was so happy when I quit that place, not because of the customers but because of the crazy manager. I have a lot of stories about her, I will add one later.

JacOfAllTrades,56,,78,13dve0,,367,"**UPDATED**

I had to deny a promotion last month because I couldn't guarantee a specific date to be back by from my knee surgery, and the promotion was instead given to a girl I was friendly with. We're about the same age, have a similar sense of humor, and our main difference is that I work really hard, and she chats with everybody. She's friendly enough, just kinda lazy. I congratulated her when she got the promotion, which is basically like being a demi-supervisor (effectively, she got keys to the door and register... that's about it).

She has now become a monster.

Because I know how to run all of the systems and do almost every job, no one really tells me what to do, because it's probably already done. She has taken to finding me and telling me to go do things that fall under one of the following: 1) don't need to be done; 2) physically can't be done by me (again, just got back from knee surgery); or 3) are in no way my job, and the person's job that it is is present. And she doesn't ask, oh no, she *demands*. And, to be clear, she has absolutely no authority over me. None.

Let me set up a scenario for you: I was working on a floorset project, and in the middle of it she walks up and says, ""Go clean the break table.""

Me: If I have time after I finish my work, then I'll look at it.

Her: No, I said go clean it *now*!

Me: No.

Her: You know I can write you up!? Don't disrespect me!

Me: You can suggest a write up... and the GM wouldn't approve it, so you can get over that idea right now.

Her: Did you hear me!? I said go clean the break table or you're getting written up!

Me: No. It's not my job, you and three other people are here, and it's ya'll's job. You go do it.

Her: Are you trying to push me around!? That's it, you're getting written up!

Me: Go for it.

At that point she grabbed an armful of the stuff I had just set up and stormed off... super mature. About 30 minutes later she comes back, again, in the middle of me doing my actual job:

Her: That break table is still a mess! Get your ass in there and clean it!

Me: I told you no. Unless you are going to turn me into a puppet, get out of my face. I'm not doing it.

Her: *screaming* Do it now!

Me: No...

Her: You're getting written up again!

Me: Go for it...

After that she came over to harass me one more time, at which point I threatened to call the GM about it (this was at 6am...), and she finally let it be. When I happened to go back into the break room, the table was covered with boxes marked for upstock, which is 13' in the air. Remember when I said *knee surgery*... you expect me to climb a ladder with a box on my shoulder? Pft. So, for her sake, I took all the boxes off of the break table, and, in a very passive-aggressive maneuver, stacked them in front of her preferred computer in the back. Whoops. Break table is clean.

That was yesterday, today a friend and I went shopping, and I bought several Christmas gifts. Unfortunately, she was the only person with keys available to ring me, and after being told they were Christmas gifts and handed a list of the skus, she proceeded to rip open every box and the tissue (I don't mean open normally, I mean shredded cardboard and paper), then jam it all (everything I bought was glass) into a single bag with no padding. Fuck that. I left it sitting right there, took my receipt, walked into the back, and got the exact same things I'd just purchased, put them nicely into a bag with proper padding, then found the ASM and verified the receipts to the items in the bag. I got a text 15 minutes ago: she called the DM and LP and accused me of theft. AFTER a manager verified my purchase because she destroyed the first set.

If you're that intimidated because you got the promotion someone else had to pass on, then those keys are better off in your colon than in your hand. Bitch.

**Update:** There was a meeting held with the DM, the manager who checked me, the GM, and the demi-manager (which I was supposed to attend, but other circumstances prevented it). The DM informed me that I didn't do anything against policy and to be ""more conscientious of how things might look in the future"". According to the manager that checked me, the demi-manager received a write up and was apparently left alone with the DM and GM for about ten minutes, which means there's a pretty good chance she was chewed out the whole time. As far as I know she still has keys, but even if she changes her behavior now, I'm willing to bet they take them away after the holidays. I can only hope that if it doesn't change they don't give her that long.",Let me tell you *exactly* where you can put those keys,445,talesFromRetail
DrEyepatch,82,,103,1q1w3a,,368,"Backstory: I used to work at a convenience store at a fairly popular tourist destination. This store was one of two convenience stores on the entire island, and we had a prime location within walking distance of about 10 bars. We always have a deputy within earshot of out doors during this time of the year. Night shifts during the busy season were always fun, to say the least.

Sorry for the wall of text.

Story: It's about 2AM, and I was working a double that night because a less-than-reliable employee had called out. No biggie, we get free coffee and I loved working overnights because of the crazy happenings, not to mention overtime.

Myself and another employee (T) were pretty much stuck behind the registers due to the volume of people in the store. We were also getting psyched up to stop selling alcohol at 2:30, because when you tell a drunk person that they can't buy booze, they tend to get a fairly upset. Then, this fairly attractive lady wearing nothing but a bikini caught me completely off guard.

She was obviously drunk, and made her way to the rollergrill to buy some hotdogs. I was working the register closest to the grill, so any questions about it were my problem, not T's. This young lady, let's call her Chili Cheese Girl (CCG), asked me how much the hotdogs were, I informed her, then she asked if the chili and cheese were free, which they were.

When I gave her that nugget of information, her eyes lit up, she gave me the biggest, most genuine smile, and thanked me. It was like I had just sold her a winning lotto ticket, she was so ecstatic. I wrote it off to her bring drunk and hungry, and continued to ring up customers.

The chili and cheese for the hotdogs are in a dispenser where you hold the hotdog under the dispenser and press a button to delicify your snack. CCG goes to town on that thing, pouring mountains of cheese and chili onto this poor bit of meat and bread. I notice, and don't think much of it. After a moment, I hear something that grabs my attention.

CCG: ""It's sooo warm!""

I look over to find that she has smeared this mess of low-grade foodstuffs all over her chest. It's dripping everywhere. The counter is covered, the floor is covered, and this scantily clad girl is covered. I do my best to keep from laughing, but a hearty chortle manages to escape. I am in disbelief. I look at the customer in front of me, an elderly black man, and we share a look of disgust, entertainment, and a slight bit of arousal before chuckling to ourselves.

I get T's attention, and he goes wide-eyed and tries to work through his own laughter. I turn my attention to CCG, who is now squatting down, with her face under a pulsing fountain of golden cheese-product, and rubbing the remnants of her hotdog ALL over her body. I get enough of a straight face to pipe up, after telling the people in my line to ""Wait just one moment""

Me: ""Ma'am, are you alright, do you need any help?

CCG: ""No, I'm good. I just can't get over how WARM this is.""

Me: ""Err... Yes ma'am, I can understand, but you're making a mess everywhere. I think that's enough. Just come up to the register and I'll ring you up.""

CCG: ""Oh, sorry. I'm a little drunk, I didn't think it was going everywhere. Just one second""

I give the ""Sorry, just let me get this bitch out of my store"" look to the customer in front of me and he gets where I'm coming from, and takes a step back. CCG is topping off her meat with some more chili. She steps up to the counter, and I notice just how much of this crap she has on her. She is covered nearly head to toe, and dripping everywhere. I mean, this stuff is coming off in sloughs, she definitely emptied our supplies.

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to charge you extra for all of this.""

CCG: ""But you said it was free""

Me: ""Yeeaah, but you only have one hotdog, and you clearly have more than one hotdog's worth of condiments. Plus, you're wrecking my store. Sorry, it's company policy.""

CCG: ""But you fucking said it was free, how the fuck are you going to charge me for something that's free!?""

She was starting to get pissed at this point, and after a moment of arguing back and forth, I said ""Look, you can give me the 5 bucks, or I can have the big-ass deputy outside make you pay me.""

Kamekazii,32,,79,10reg5,,377,"So I'm working the Saturday after a Friday when we were on holiday. Obviously this meant that all the people who normally shop on Friday, as one, decided to do it a day later instead of a day earlier so we were super busy. 

In comes some lady who looks like she's having a bad day and wants to pass it on. You know the type: the customer who just watches intently, *waiting* for you to mess up so he/she can bitch you out. I can tell you that after serving 1 000 other customers in the last 3 or 4 hours I served her the exact same way I served everyone else. No dice. 

Something I did wasn't good enough for her. Without too much detail, we'll say she had her own way of arranging things and I was an idiot for not understanding it without a word from her through osmosis I guess. 

She gives me a good talking too about failing to exercise my psychic powers for her convenience and stalks off. Some random guy behind me, a bearded, steel worker type who'd been shaking his head the whole time suddenly looks up and shouts: ""Bitch needs to get laid!"" She could hear, and her back stiffened with rage. But she dare not challenge another customer, and so she didn't look back. I served that guy with a big smile on my face.

Maybe not the way I would have put it, bearded guy, but it made me laugh and gave me something of a parting shot after being verbally abused. ",A *customer* backs me up?!,456,talesFromRetail
blab70,54,,71,1jyqml,,367,"First time posting, hope I do this correctly.

My first job was working as a sales associate in one of those big nationwide stores that sell almost everything. Now by sales associate, I should really say I was the store bitch. I got hired a few months after my 16th birthday to work the products part of the floor. Over the next year and a half I worked in literally every single department possible. This included:

Clothing, Electronics, Food Alley, Registers, Customer Service, Cart Attendant, Returns, and Back Room (despite the fact I was not 18). I never complained and never had a problem going where I was asked.

Then my yearly review came up for my raise... My maximum potential raise would be 25 cents, not much but still exciting for a new person in the work force. What I didn't realize was that all those times covering shifts, coming in early, NEVER (repeat never calling out), etc would not mean jack when it came to my raise.

Out of a possible 25, I got 4 cents. Yes, 4 cents. The reasoning being that I was often ""all over the place and unable to focus on my task at hand."" The examples they gave me were that when an extra cashier was needed and no one answered the call over the radio, me asking if they needed me to come down followed by an answer of ""yes"" meant I was doing the wrong thing. Go figure.

Despite all these BS I kept working there (later found out the stoner kid at electronics got a 24 cent raises despite the fact he called out all the time and would take breaks 3x as long as required). Then school came around for my senior year and I joined cross country as a means of trying to get into better shape, so I worked less as a result, often only getting 8 hours a week.

Then, a month or so after the stock market crash and the recession began I got called into my HR manager's office. He explained to me that he asked me if I would be willing to work at least 25 hours a week (still in high school, doing sports at the time, and had a girlfriend at the time so I was already stretching it when it came to my availability). I told him no, then this happened.

""Well, I'm sorry to say but we are doing to have to let you go then.""

""What? Why?""

""You aren't willing to work as much as we need you to, it isn't worth putting you on the payroll. Friday (this happened on a monday) will be your last day.""

I took it in stride, left after my shift was over and applied at another place a bunch of my friends worked at and got hired with a higher starting wage within 2 days. I went in on thursday to tell the HR guy as much.

""Hey, no hard feelings. I already found a new job so I'll be okay, thanks again for everything, (he was a nice guy to me before this all). I start my new job tomorrow so I obviously won't be able to work my shift here.""

He looks up at me as if I just took a shit on his desk and called his mother a whore.

""You what!? You're kidding right?""

""No, why would I be?

""XXXXX you're showing a real lack of commitment to this company. This is incredibly unprofessional of you, when someone puts in their two weeks notice they don't-""

I snapped, tired of his bullshit.

""MY two weeks notice!? You're the asshole who fired a high school kid for not working more hours which would only make me end up working here for the rest of my life and you think I'm unprofessional? Fuck you.""

Stunned, he just stared at me, mouth wide open. At this point a crowd had gathered outside his door.

""I think you should leave""

""I think I should, all this bullshit is making me lightheaded.""

I left, and never went back. I just graduated college and started a paid internship in the field I studied, I later found out the HR guy was transferred to a different store and was fired about a year ago.

TL;DR: Worked my ass off, company didn't give a shit and gave me a horrible raise. When economy slowed down, they asked me to work WAY too many hours despite being in high school, let me go as a result. I got a better job and the HR guy freaked when I told him I couldn't work my last shift.","""You're showing a real lack of commitment to this company.""",438,talesFromRetail
DrDoye,35,,94,1iue3n,,374,"Back again. The fun just doesn't stop, oh boy. After getting fired that night we didn't see from him again, and then during morning shift he appears wearing his uniform (which wasn't even done properly as he was missing his tie and wore sandals) and goes up to our register. He can't login, and starts asking why he can't login.

My co-worker and I just look at him like he's gone crazy. My co-worker whispers we should call Police he may be planning to go postal. I pull Ex-new guy aside and ask him, why on gods green Earth would he come back here after he was fired for stealing from the register. EX-New guy tells me ""Ah, I still had shifts for this week. Dave didn't say anything about those shifts. I'm just assuming I can finish out my week and I'll get a paycheck and maybe they'll give me a second chance"". My co-worker and I start laughing, this is some kind of prank, it has to be. 

Co-worker tells me we should call Dave, our department manager and get rid of him. I agreed with that motion, and so I called up Dave. Dave is not happy with what we said, he thinks we're screwing with him,  ""Boys I tell you what if he's not there, then there will be hell to pay"" dave said. We try to tell Ex-new guy Dave is on his way to our department and he isn't going to be happy to see New guy.

Meanwhile new guy roams off to start folding clothes. Dave arrives and he isn;t happy, ""Where is he?"", he shouts. Mike, my co-worker who can barely contain his laughter says he doesn't know anything and it was all my responsibility. Dave turns his attention to me, ""You said he was here. Where is he?"", I tell Dave that the new guy went off to fold clothes because he couldn't login. He thinks he isn't fired. Dave turns around and there's new guy by the coat dress shirts putting everything out and putting them up in the wrong fucking order.

Dave, walks over to new guy and grabs him by the shoulder. Mike is struggling not laugh, and I'm just shaking my head as I will no doubt get blamed for this. Dave doesn't drag New guy off to his office, no he publicly humiliates the poor guy ""You were FIRED. You stole from the register, I made this perfectly clear you were not to set foot in this store again in exchange for me not pressing charges. Obviously you didn't care because now I'm going to call Police. Come with me to my office NOW!"", all the while new guy is crying and begging him to give him a second chance.  

That's the last we see of him for awhile. Another manager comes over and tells us to go over and clean up the dress shirts. As we're cleaning up the shirts and the mess that guy made (serious how can 1 guy in just 8 minutes ruin an entire rack row of clothes?) we watch as the police enter the store and head to the offices.  

About 15 minutes pass and we see them leave, new guy is in cuffs and forced to go out the entrance and that's the last we see of him, hopefully.",You were fired so why are you coming back here in uniform?,468,talesFromRetail
Osiris32,131,,80,1boqxq,,372,"You may remember [this tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1bag6d/yelling_at_the_wrong_guy_or_how_a_bitchy_lady/) that I told a few days ago from my days working at a busy gas station.  Here is another one, thankfully shorter.

'Twas a nice summer day, one of those rare days in Oregon when the temperature is *just right,* the humidity is *just right,* and the breeze is *just right* so that everyone is wearing t-shirts, shorts, and a big smile.  I was having a good day at work that day, as I had been told to be outside pumping gas in the sun and the warm.  Customers were being polite and friendly.  The manager was in a good mood.  Everything was going smoothly.  I should have known.

In pulls a large van and trailer, with Ohio plates.  We're busy but not hyper-busy at this point, but I was always on the lookout for out-of-state plates.  For those of you who don't know, Oregon (along with New Jersey) does not allow self-service gas.  Been that way since the '40s.  But many, many people don't know this.  So I finished up the customer I was with, and jogged over just in time to see the Ohio driver get out of his car and approach the pump to pump his own.

I approached him, a sheepish smile on my face, my hands spread in a sign of apology, and politely informed him that, as an out of state resident, he might be unfamiliar with Oregon laws regarding self service.  I'm also wearing a bright blue/white uniform combo with the company logo and my name in bright red.  It's pretty obvious that I'm a gas attendant employed there and I'm not about to be an ass to him.  However, his reaction was nearly instant, and extremely out of proportion to what I had just said.  He got a nearly-Exorcist-level snarl of rage on his face.

And then punched me.  In the nose.

Now, I'm not sure if he was just a weak individual, or if he had held himself back, but the punch wasn't THAT hard.  Enough to make me take a couple steps back and say ""Owwwww!"" but not enough to drop me or make it hard to see.  I touched my nose.  Blood.  Wow.  I hadn't been punched in the face since I was in junior high.  And this *individual* (definitely not a man) had just suckered me for being polite and friendly.

Now, if you remember for my last story, I was in college majoring in criminal justice while I was working at that station.  Majoring in criminal justice isn't just sitting in classes learning about laws and investigative techniques.  Some of the more...visceral...aspects of law enforcement are taught.  Like unarmed self defense.  And when the guy wound up for a second punch, I reacted with the training I'd been taught.  Left foot forward, right hand grabbing their right wrist, left hand placed below their elbow, pivot clockwise on left foot while lowering right hand and raising left, place assailant's right hand in crook of left arm, grab assailant's right upper arm arm with left hand, lift up left arm.  Boom, standard law enforcement hammer lock.

But now what?  I look over at the nearest employee, who just happens to catch my eye, and see the blood coming down my face and a guy who looked like a short, bespectacled version of [Ned Beatty](http://www.topquarkia.com/Docs/Notebook/Ned_Beatty_cap.jpg) wrapped up like a Taco del Mar Supreme Burrito in front of me.  I didn't even have to say anything, he whipped out his cell phone and called 911.

Two units arrive rather quickly, and take custody of the guy, who really isn't talking, just snarling at me.  I make a statement to the officers, and they go inside to review the security camera footage.  Local paramedics were called, since I was bleeding pretty good.  I refused to be taken to the hospital, though, since I didn't have insurance and an ambulance ride + ER visit = $$$$.  I went to the doctor the next day, who x-rayed my head and said I had several broken nasal bones.  This info was copied and given to the DA.

So Ohio guy got arrested and charged with Assault II, a class B felony.  My manager was nice enough to send me home (with pay) since I looked like, well, like someone had punched me in the face, and that wouldn't be good for business.  Ohio guy WAS from Ohio, apparently doing a massive road trip across the US, and due to lack of sleep (or some other lame excuse) came unglued at me.  He plead out to Assault IV (class A misdemeanor) and spent a week in jail.  I got three days of medical leave.

bloodsponge,110,,99,15o3m9,,367,"Our pharmacy used to be 24-hours, just like our store. However, years ago, other branches opened over town, so our customer base dwindled and there was no longer a real need for my store to keep such hours. The pharmacy now closes (and has for a few years) at 10pm, and the store closes at 11pm. On the weekends, the pharmacy closes at 6pm.

This guy wandered in tonight at about 9:30 and headed right for the pharmacy. I figured he was one of the many in need of cold medicine. I go about my business, setting up the new ad flyers and suggestive sell candies, when I hear from the back: ""HELLLLLOOOOOOO!"" and knocking on the window to the pharmacy. Because, clearly, when the lights in there are off and the window gate is down, someone must be in there playing hide and go seek. 

Moments later, the same guy comes to me and asks me if anyone is in the pharmacy. He has one of those little cards that we keep in the aisle for certain medications that can only be given to customers by the pharmacist. It is Bronkaid.

""Is there any way you can get me this from the pharmacy?""

""No sir, the pharmacy closed at 6 tonight.""

""WHAT! Since when does this pharmacy close?! I need this medicine! Can't you just open the door and grab it for me?""

""I'm sorry, I can't open the pharmacy for you. I am not authorized.""

""Well who is!?""

""The pharmacist. But the pharmacy is closed and won't open until tomorrow morning.""

""Well my wife is having an asthma attack! What are *you* going to do about it?!""

For the love of frick, man. I am not a pharmacist. I **cannot** open the pharmacy, as it is ILLEGAL for me to do so, and I would have NO IDEA what I would be doing. If your wife is having an asthma attack, a pill is not going to help her. She probably couldn't even swallow a pill. She needs an inhaler, and you should probably take her to the hospital if she doesn't have that. Don't put this kind of responsibility and guilt on me. 

My shift supervisor is at this moment taking the till out from register two. I glance at her and her expression tells me that I'm all clear to be as blunt as necessary (I really like this supervisor, btw).

""There is nothing **I** can do for you sir. **I** am not a pharmacist. **I** am not responsible for your wife's medication. There is a hospital with an ER a few miles north of here. Try there.""

Beake,80,,80,1kqlew,,373,"Long rant incoming:

So a few years ago I worked in a retail setting as a salesperson. In my business, we got a smattering of the demographic: some very poor, some very affluent. There were bad eggs on both sides of course, but the types I could not tolerate were not the demanding, or angry, or difficult ones; the worst were the disrespectful ones. The ones that, when they come into the store, one wonders whether they just parade through their whole lives thinking that they are better than everyone else. And not on a case by case basis, like ""I'm smarter than you"" or ""I'm very successful"", but that think that you, as a person and retail worker, are indubitably beneath them, almost a different caste. They don't even outright say disrespectful things, they just treat you like a non-human servant.

Well, my city had a few places of business that spawned a lot of these types. You know the type. The type who drives his BMW up to the first, closest spot of the store and leaves it running the entire 30 minutes he's there. Congratulations, you're so important that the 2 seconds it takes to start your car cannot be wasted doing so.

Anyway, I digress. It is 7-8, and a gaggle of these types walk in. One man, whom I will call Pompous Shithead (PS), his wife, and another couple. I greet them as they walk in with a genuine-sounding ""hello! How are you all doing?"". No response. They've heard me: the place is dead quiet and one of the wives made eye contact with me. They walk a few steps away and start looking at a product. I reluctantly follow them and ask them whether I can help them with anything or whether they have any questions. PS looks at me square in the eyes--I mean really looks me up and down--for literally 3-4 seconds and then says ""Yes, tell me about x."" I explain all that I know about them and say how excited I am for the product to be coming in this year. He cuts me off and starts asking a follow-up question. Again, he looks me square in the eye as he talks over me. At this point, I'm becoming irritated to say the least. I answer his question and as I'm answering he turns away and says something to his wife. Then, he asks the same question, indignantly, because clearly he didn't hear me because he was fucking not paying attention to me! When he repeats the question he takes a really condescending tone, like he's annoyed at how ineffectual I am at communicating. The other couple he came in with sigh at me.

I give a very concise, truncated response. He turns around and looks at the product without saying much and I stick around. People at this store sometimes expect me or others to be their personal shopper and silently stand by them in the chance they need something carried or questions answered. I understand being polite as a salesperson, and being available, but I cannot stand how some will, without a word, walk away from you or ignore you for several minutes and still expect you to follow them around.

He asks about a model that is a step below the one on display. This is a model I've never heard of, but, sometimes, especially when we change model years, there are things I don't know.

""What do you have cheaper that has these features?"" PS asks.

I hesitate somewhat, unsure: ""I'm not sure that there exists one with those features."" He looks at me, displeased and silent. Then, I say, ""but I'll go double check the manufacturer's website."" And as I walk away he says, ""that's better.""

At this point I'm fuming, but I'm torn on how to behave. I decide at this point I'm going to be straightfoward with him to combat his rudeness and not kowtow to him. It was the only thing I could do short of telling him to fuck off and I couldn't help him. Well, I look it up and I'm 100% right. They do not make that model.

""Sir, it looks like I was right: they do not make that model.""

PS snaps at me, ""They do make it. Do I have to do your job for you? How can you know so little?"" He looks at his friends and shrugs at my incompetence.

""They list every product they make on their website, and I am unfortunately not able to order that item as they do not make it.""

""Show it to me. I know for a fact that it's on their website and you obviously don't know what you're doing.""

I go to the computer and PS follows on my heels. I pull up the website and show that it is not made. There, you're wrong, idiot, I think.

""No, no. I saw it on the internet just today. Where are you?"" He looks at the website, thinking I'm tricking him. At this point I know he's wrong, dead wrong. I'm also very pissed at his treatment of me. I could have let it go. The others in the group were across the store and standing, so before I say a word to him I, in faked consideration, offer them the seats that are nearby the computer. That way this idiot can be lambasted in front of his friends.

PS was still mad and thinking of reasons why I was wrong, so I offered to let him navigate the website so that he can make a fool of himself. Now his friends are all watching too. He's getting very mad and clicking around on the website. He cannot find it and does a Google search of it. Still, nothing. All the while he's making excuses and blaming me wildly. His friends, who probably thought this would be a good game of humiliate the salesperson, are now beginning to quiet.

He sees we're on Firefox. ""Well wait, what the fuck is this? This is all wrong. We're obviously on the wrong internet. What kind of set up do you have?""

""That is the browser, sir. Is there a browser you're more comfortable with?"" He says ""the blue one,"" at me like I'm using some sort of technology designed to trick customers. I click on Chrome even though I know he means IE and he flips. At this point, he's obviously embarrassing himself in front of his group, and they've ceased to make sighs and expressions at my stupidity.

""I don't know what internet you're on, but this isn't right. It's on the internet, I saw it. Your computer is messed up."" The loudness in his voice lowers as he realizes he's run out of ammo to blame me with. Then, trying to maintain some semblance of dignity, he says on his way out that he'll find it at home and I better fucking learn my products better.

One morning I notice an employee I'd just hired, X, biking in in the snow. I asked him how long he'd been biking and found out he'd spent over an hour on his bicycle in sub freezing weather. From then on I added him to my pick-up list. He was a great guy, from a low-income family... but he was going to make it out. At 22 years old X was working full time for me, going to school full time, and on the side he made his own music and videos. This kid was impressively bright and a damned hard worker.

We left the day after Christmas to return home and I got a call from another employee nearly in tears. On Christmas evening X had been out biking, visiting friends and family and something happened, we still don't know what.

They found him the day after Christmas in an alley, dead of hypothermia and with some of his clothing removed. No sign of a struggle, no drugs or alcohol involved on his part.

While I was having Christmas dinner with my family this inspiring 22 year-old was freezing to death in an alley.

On this day I was working on the cash registers. I'd been there for about three or four hours, and as I'd walked in, there'd been this homeless guy begging out the front of the centre. In my state, begging is illegal, the police are called, you have to move on. They're not usually charged or anything, just forced to move away. This guy is fairly regular - I work and live in the somewhat seedy side of my city, and I'd seen him around before. He'd hold up a small cardboard sign and sit slumped on the cement in the cold. It was sad, but I'd never personally given him money.

So this day he walks into the supermarket. Not unusual, he'd sometimes buy smokes or some noodles with the money he'd begged. Everyone else was serving so he came down to my register. The usual, 'How are you today?' and he asked for cigarettes. I turn back, smokes in hand, when he pulls out of his big jacket bundles of coin. Anyone else on this thread knows what I mean - a small bag, or cardboard, rolled up with a certain amount of money inside. He pulls out about $70 worth of gold coins and asks for more cigarettes. 

At this point I was somewhat shocked, and as I watched him, he pulled out a bright new shiny iPhone 5, clicks it, and calls someone that he's on his way. He turns back to me, pays for it in more gold coins (For us Australian's, that's $1 and $2 coins) and leaves. I decided to follow him out - telling my supervisor I had to let the security guard know something.

I walk out the main doors, and he's sitting there again, looking as dirty and as homeless as possible. I couldn't believe this was the same guy who'd just pulled out a phone newer than my own. I explained the situation to the security guard - that there was someone begging, etc. and he walks out to ask the man to move on. The 'homeless' man does - walks straight into the car park, a few metres away, and gets into a fairly nice car, drives off. Utter disbelief.

The next day the security guard let me know the same guy was back, I alerted my supervisor and she called the cops. Turns out the guy had done jail time for fraud (from begging) and they'd been looking for him for awhile. He'd also stolen cars and broken into houses previously.",Homeless guy with an iPhone...,438,talesFromRetail
xOohShinyThing,58,,90,1batxv,,374,"just a shortish one, and i'll try to make it as non-ranting as possible. i supervise at a department store, over the registers and refunds counters. i had one of my staff get yelled at by a pair of parents while i was serving a customer of my own. i went over to see what i could do to calm the situation. there's a husband and wife, and their ~10 year old daughter. the parents are standoffish, and the daughter's staring around, bored.

""your staff member showed my child the surprise i was buying her, and now her birthday is ruined!"". i glance at her purchase, a massive 50x50x10cm lego box. i'm used to customers being a little slow on retail policies, sure. but, this? surely she's joking. or confused. or drunk. drunk's most likely. i look to her husband: surely he must realise the absurdity of his wife's actions. shopping with the kid present? i expect some embaressed/apologetic eye-roll or something. but, no: he's by her side, glaring at my staff and myself.

""sorry, i've obviously came in half-way through this. tell me if i have this wrong, please. you came shopping for a gift for your daughter?""

""yes. i said that.""

"".. while she and your husband are by your side.""

""i needed his input to decide on a gift, she is his child as well, after all!""

i'm stunned for a moment. it's been weeks since i had such an absurd customer. these people are serious. until now i thought they might have been joking.

""i'm not sure if you realised, but the center has a child's play area past the cafe around the corner. it's supervised, and has space for parents to sit and talk, make mobile calls to others while the shop and such."". i try to hint at it without making myself sound snarkingly obvious, waiting for the coin to drop, that moment of ""oh i'm and idiot customer, sorry"" clarity.

but, nope. nothing. i sigh inward and smile to my staff member, and she knows to back away and let me deal with it. the customers either expect me to lie to their daughter and keep the toy until she leaves, or give them some gift card as ""compensation for the hardship"" they feel entitled to. i look over to the daughter, she looks like a nice enough girl, staring back at me. i hate lying to kids because of their parents, and i force a smile, when i'd rather glare at her parents. ""i'm sorry lass, but this toy has to stay in the store with me. your dad's going to take you outside for a bit, while mum stays with me and tries to fix things.""

the daughter winks at me with a smile, and then quickly frowns and shrugs her shoulders with a small whine. ""ok.. dad, let's go wait for mum.""

coolest. fucking. kid. ever. i can't help but smile back at her as she takes her dad's hand and leads him out.

once they leave, i finish off the mum's sale and wrap it in a bag. she leaves with a huff, and my staff makes a ""up yours"" gesture behind her back as she walks off. satisfied with the outcome, we get back to work.

i know that sometimes it's unavoidable that you'll be ""parenting"" your children while simultaneously required to buy them a surprise gift for future use. but.

if you're shopping with your significant other, how about next time you have them take your child off for a stroll/snack/distraction while you shop? just an idea.

tellsbadstories,64,,55,x7lhx,,373,"This is a story from a few years back when I worked at a liquor/convenience store.

It was about 10:30 at night, closing time an eternal half hour away, and just me on cash register while my manager is cleaning the floors. Two teenagers, probably 16 or 17 years old, come in and start walking around. As they head towards the liquors section the manager starts to follow them. He stops one of them and asks if he can be of any help (obviously trying to scare them off). The kid says no and starts to walk away. He leaves empty handed.
Meanwhile, the other kid has grabbed a handle (1.75L) of rum and is heading towards my register. As he turns the corner he breaks into a dead sprint, throws something at me, bursts out the door, and jumps into an idling car that quickly pulls away. As I begin to comprehend what has happened I look at my counter and see that his projectile was actually $30 cash, covering the rum he took and leaving me a nice little tip. 

Since the boys didn’t actually steal anything we decided not to call the cops or tell the owners what had happened and finished off the night as uneventfully as ever.

AckAckADack,68,,55,1qxzyy,,370,"Long time reader first time posting. I devoted the better part of a decade to a company that sells guitars and thinks it's the center of the universe so my tale originates there. If you guys like, I'll put more up. Here goes. 

So one day whilst working a shift as the pro audio department manager, an attractive lady walks in and begins to look around. My slightly new co-worker K engages her and she's talking about she is interested in becoming a DJ. No problems there. K comes and asks me to assist him in closing the sale, not a problem. We get her into a very nice introductory setup - everything's cool. K begins ringing her up and announces the total - $1200. Lady doesn't even blink at the amount and pulls out a wad of cash. K looks at me with a bewildered look ""Ack, I've never seen that much cash before."" Me being used to dealing with large cash transactions, I just told him to make sure he counts it properly and drops it in the safe. He begins to count the money and is looking very nervous. I stand next to him and ask what's going on. ""Ummm Ack, this is a lot of cash."" I look at him then at the customer and immediately figure out why he's nervous. (In a lot of cases at our store, when folks pay large amounts of cash they tend to be involved in not so legal activities but money is money and as long as the sale gets made, I don't ask questions.) He's making the assumption that she's potentially a drug dealer. I begin to figure out ways to not make the situation any more tense when the customer speaks up and says ""Don't worry, it's not drug money, I'm a stripper."" I bust out laughing while K turns a very bright red.

fuckyouasiandaughter,63,,61,1gsz15,,364,"This happened a few months ago, but I just discovered this subreddit so I felt like I should share the story.

I used to work at an electronics store and this Asian family was buying a laptop for their daughter (she just got into a prestigious high school). I could tell the family wasn't well off financially, and gave everything they could to the daughter. My co-worker was handling the sale, but because the parents couldn't speak English, I was there to translate. 

From the conversation, I could tell buying her this laptop is big purchase for them, we compared prices and I tried to ensure the family got the best laptop for their budget. Then comes the mandatory sales pitch from my co-worker about ""setting up the computer"" and purchasing Microsoft Office. Now this is the biggest rip-off and how we earn money at the store, the set-up fee (which is just filling in your name, etc. when you get a new laptop) is $100, the customer has to pay $150 for MS Office plus a $50 installation fee because we do it for you. 

It's no surprise the parents was shocked at the price, but they thought it was necessary because they don't know much about computers. The daughter insisted on how much she ""needed it"". In Mandarin, I kindly warned them against the purchase and explained why, trying to save them some money since you can easily do the set-up and pirate MS Office or even buy it for cheaper online. The parents were really grateful for the information but... the daughter starts CRYING, like bawling her eyes out. Needless to say, my white co-worker was confused as to why she is crying. She starts wailing about how I told her parents not to buy this for her, the computer won't run without the setup, it's not the Microsoft won't be the same unless she buys it, etc. Her parents are obviously telling her to stop, but she already caused the scene. 

My manager comes out, sorts the situation out. The parents thanked and apologized to me as they left, but the daughter ratted me out to my manager since she can speak English. So the not so secret ending is... My manager was pissed that I lost income for the store, the sales guy was pissed I lost him additional commission. I was fired. 

They were right to fire me, but fuck that girl. ","I'm sorry I saved your parents $300, got fired.",425,talesFromRetail

#1 **Backgound:** Ok so, one of these stories comes from the 5 years I worked a college IT Help Desk. I put this here instead of TFTS because the majority of what I did involved people and making sure they could access the campus wifi, nothing ""tech heavy."" Anyway, this story sticks out the most because I'd been the student supervisor for 4 years at that point and my sarcasm level had risen every year. I'd dealt with every college stereotype possible but my favorite were the freshman ""Brosephs"" mainly because they were nice guys under it all and fun to mess with.

My help desk comrade and I were just getting settled when in walks the bro, think as stereotypical as you can and you have him perfect.

**BRO:** *Hey bro, can I get wifi?*

**ME:** *Sure, open your laptop for me.*

He opens it toward me and I take it out of sleep mode and almost choke on my tongue. His desktop is a picture of a well known porn star with her legs spread, one hand at ground zero and the other in her mouth. Now my compatriot and I had a tally going of how many times this had happened. Our current total was up to 200. I smile and say...

**ME:** *Hey man, can you change your background pic for me?*

**BRO:** *Why? It's a pic of my car.*

**ME:** with a smirk and in a whisper *No, it's not. It's a porn star's vagina....*

He very quickly turned bright red and changed the picture.

**ME:** *Don't stress it, you're not the first. How about we set you up with a good anti-virus while you're here?*

I still laugh about it because he was very sweet and I'm sure I look like an asshole but really, change your background before you take in your computer.

#2 **Background:** I mentioned before I worked for a library, this takes place there. This is word for word.

I'm working Tech (public computers) at this point and I'm on the floor doing my walk around and helping patrons. Now I'd made a lot of friends in security because they are my main defense should someone decide to get in my face. We also had three rotating Deputies who were all awesome. Both my favorite Deputy and security officer are on duty at the Tech Center, so I'm happy.

It's important to point out that I'd started losing weight and was down about 20lbs. Getting hit on by the public happens, cheesy pick up lines the whole thing. If you're a woman with curves, it happens daily. Thankfully I used to bounce at a bar so I can handle myself. I'm helping a man in a fur coat. He thinks he's a pimp and I cannot stand helping him, because he's like a greasy car salesman and you want to shower when you meet him. I've finished helping him with his email and am about to leave his computer...

We'll call him Pimp in a Fur Coat (PFC)

**PFC:** *Shorty, Shorty, I got a question for you.*

**ME:** *Sure, PFC what's the question* (I'm always polite)

**PFC:** *I been want'en to know, you half black? Cuz you got youself a fine ass that makes me want to put somfin in ya.*

I'm a little stunned because usually PFC is politely creepy.

**ME:** *PFC, that is a very inappropriate comment and I don't appreciate it.!* 

I move to walk away. He then makes his mistake, he touches me on my waist. I'm a pretty easy going person, but people do NOT touch me without my permission and not so intimately, he's going to die.

**PFC:** *Now, shorty I'm jus sayin you is a fine lady and I like'em fat.*  Yeah, he called me fat.

**ME:** I get real close to his face *PFC, I am not half black I'm native american, I do NOT want you to put anything in me and do you see those two men looking at us over there? If you do not remove your hand and leave this building NOW I will press charges for harassment, they will cuff you and take you to the pokey. I don't think your parole officer will look to kindly on harassing a librarian, do you?* 

He got up and left in a hurry. When I got back to the main desk both deputy and security are doubled over in tears.

**Deputy** *I don't know what you said, but a look of sheer terror crossed his face. He looked like you had him by the balls!*

**Security** *Yeah, we were ready to rush over until, deputy here saw a murder look cross your face and we knew it was going to be good!*

Anyway, my manager and I were working one Saturday, and the owner (also the manager's father) had just dropped by to check up on how things were going, do some bookkeeping, you know, owner stuff.

Well, in barges this old woman who looked a little disheveled.  Keep in mind that I'm on the floor at this point and the owner is currently the one standing behind the counter near the entrance.

""Hello!"" the owner greeted the lady, ""Can I help you find anything?""

""Yeah, do you guys sell that Nintendo 3D thing?""

Being a gamer, my ears perk up, we don't carry video games at the store but I kind of move towards the front of the store, just in case.

""I... I don't know what that is?"" said the puzzled owner.

I pop my head out from behind a shelf of stuffed animals, ""It's a handheld video game system.""

""Ah,"" the owner acknowledged, then he said to the lady ""No we don't, I'm sorry, we don't carry any video games or systems.  You could try \*store with a red circular logo* at [directions from the toy store to \*store with a red circular logo*].""

However, halfway through his directions to \*store with a red circular logo*, the lady turns to me and asks ""Do you have one?""

""Yes I do,"" I responded.  It was in fact in my pocket at the time.  (It's fun to get StreetPass tags with the kids who come into the store sometimes.)  But I didn't let her know that.

""Can I buy it from you?"" she inquired with a wide eyed stare.

""Um... I'm not selling i-""

This woman came in and started looking at a wall of high heels while her two kids immediately ran in and dove onto the leather benches we have for customers to sit on when trying on shoes.

They were screaming and chasing each other around the store and their mom completely ignored them.

Her: ""Is it that bad of quality that it would fall over? Why are the prices so expensive here anyway, if everything is so cheaply made"".

I was speechless. Her child was still hiding under the table and she made no attempt to get him out. Luckily, my boss doesn't really care if we snap back at rude customers as long as it is within reason. So I took that opportunity.

  So I work at a hotel chain, one with a dog looking animal as their logo. Anyways, I've been at the hotel for a little over a year, and at the coffee shop position for a little over 4 months. 
   One day our manager announces that he has decided to move a very disliked individual up to the coffee shop. This individual, let's call her Mandy, is rude, loud, arrogant, and all she talks about is popping adderall, and when she needs her next smoke break. Not only that, she says this loudly in front of guests and their children. Not cool. I go down to tell the managers how obnoxious and rude she is, and then my boss hit me with a stunner. She listened to me for all of about 3 sentences and interrupted me with "" here's the thing cfkid94, I would rather firethe entire team working up there, than fire her, because she is a good friend."" What the hell. I just nodded my head out of shock and went back to the coffee shop. 
   Later that Mandy was talking and i asked her to start working. She told me to fuck off. One of the supervisors hears this, comes over, and tells her he's gonna write her up for that. Mandy also tells the supervisor to fuck off. By the end of the day the supervisor is getting demoted because Mandy complained about getting written up.

I have stories that can make you cringe for how nasty people in this world can be to their fellow man, but every once in awhile I get stories of pure blissful decent human interaction.

She just wrote the letter M (for medium) and pointed to a few tops.  I proceeded to get almost 200 dollars worth of clothes for them.  At the checkout line they were pulling out all of their loose money. (I had already given them my larger employee discount for the month)  They still had about 150.

The couple paid out and the older woman hugged me.

After they left I asked the customer why she gave the couple her coupon and her response was this: ""I watched you help them all over the store when the rest of your coworkers ran away.  They made demands, you climbed a ladder for them.  You gave them your own discount to help them out. They obviously need the money off more than I do. Now what's your favorite color.""

legomaniac89,51,,83,1jp2uy,,361,"Hey TFR, here's another tale from pet store hell that just happened last week. It was about 30 minutes before closing and it had been a way-too-long-8.5-hour-shift of dealing with the most blatant ignorance and stupidity humanity has to offer. I was tired, I was hungry and I was in serious need of a shower. I just wanted to go home and crash for the rest of the evening. Then...they walked in the store.

It was a younger, maybe late-20's lady and her 3 kids, 2 girls about 10 and 8 and a boy of maybe 4. As soon as the front door opened, I hear screaming kids, and I think ""oy vey, here we go"". No sooner had they set foot in the store than all 3 hellspawn made a mad dash for the animal room. My area. Their mother had waved them off so she could do her shopping without having to deal with the stress of being a parent. I mean, retail workers are paid to babysit, aren't they?

I'm on high alert now, because children are supposed to be with their parents at all times while in the store. We have signs posted all over the place saying this (not that it ever makes much of a difference) and these kids are going to be more than a handful. They immediately start screaming at each other and are banging on pretty much every pane of glass in the room. I'm not talking tapping the fish tanks, I mean flat-palmed full-windup banging on the glass. Think Darla from Finding Nemo. Now multiply that times 3. Now give each of them the voice of a pissed off Howler Monkey. Yeah, that is these 3 kids.

So I'm chasing these sproglodytes around trying to alleviate the hurricane that followed in their wake. Exasperated cries of ""don't hit the tanks please!"" ""don't put your fingers in the bird cage!"" ""stop yelling at the rabbits!"" echoed from the animal room. Mom is all but invisible while all this is happening, apparently trying to decide if Fido needs a chicken or a pork-based food. Seriously, I feel sorry for that dog.

Finally, I gave up trying to herd all of them and yelled ""You all need to stay with your mother while you're in this store!"". The oldest girl looked at me with a smirk and said ""Well, she said we could come look at the animals"". I replied with ""I don't care what she told you, the rule is that you need to stay with her while you are in this store"". They finally wandered off to cause chaos elsewhere and I breathed a sigh of relief. At least they were out of my department. Problem solved.

Heh. Yeah, right.

Well, the kids found their mother, who promptly told them to go away because she didn't want to deal with them right now. I'm picking up the disaster area they left behind them when suddenly the screaming picks up again. I glance over to the cat area, and what I see makes the rage boil up inside of me. The two girls have pulled a cat scratching post off of the shelves and are playing ring-around-the-rosy with it. You know the kind that have a square carpeted base and a tall post in the middle? Yeah, that kind. They are twirling around this post as fast as they can, yelling and screaming incomprehensible screeches at each other. The youngest boy had swept half a shelf of small animal products off of a bottom shelf and was jumping off of the shelf repeatedly. I sighed audibly and I and a another coworker ran over to the aisle they were currently destroying.

I was done dealing with them. I get paid to help customers and maintain the animal cages, not to babysit a flock of little shitspawns. I'm yelling at this point. ""HEY! Put those back on the shelf! Go stay with your mother! I'm not going to tell you again!""

Just then, the genetic origin of the pestiferous crayon gobblers materialized behind me, deciding now was a good time to check up on her shrieklings. 

Mom: ""Why are you yelling at my kids?!?""

Me: ""They need to stay with you while in the store, and they have...""

Mom: *interrupting* ""MY PARENTING STYLE IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!""

That's it, I'm done. I've tried to be nice, but I've had it. ""Nice Retail Employee Mode"" off. ""I Don't Give A Fuck About You Or Your Money Anymore Mode"" activated.

Me: ""Your parenting style BECOMES my business when your kids are terrorizing the animals and damaging store property. We are not your babysitters, so do your job as a parent and control your kids before they break something or hurt themselves. Now buy your stuff and get out before I call the police to escort you off of store property.""

She stared at me for what seemed like an hour before grabbing the youngest by the arm and huffily storming out of the store. I could hear whiny cries of ""but I want to see the animals again!"" trailing off into the distance. I just stood there and shook my head.

And here's the kicker: she had parked her minivan in a handicap spot without a handicap license. Don't you just love people?

I love working Christmas Eve - it is always the best day because it's an early close, people come in to buy something, and everyone is happy with the warm sun and 70s in the air - a Southern Christmas!

We had tablets advertised for $69 that we had been out since Saturday, and the only tablets that were left was the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and one or two Kindle E-Readers (not the Fire). Everyone wanted them, they came and looked, we didn't have any, so they would either say ""Well that sucks, but ok"" or they'd look around the store and find something else to buy. 

Of course, since everyone wants to be by the televisions and cameras (since there was more commission in them) I was on the front line, in the laptop/tablet/tower PC area, getting all the disappointed customers, but everyone complimented my Christmas ensemble (I grew my beard, wore a Santa hat, and a festive hand-sewn sweater from my friend's mom. I looked ah-mazing. Don't laugh). 

Back to 630 PM, I get a couple - the man reeking of booze, his lady wearing half a shirt, showing her tattoo on her pregnant stomach - but hey, it's the deep south, so it's not that big of a deal. They see that every tablet (expect the Samsung 10.1 and the Kindle E-Reader) are sold out. ""You can't sell me this one?"" he said as he pointed to the $69 tablet. ""No sir, these are store displays, and we can't sell them unless the item is a closeout or open box.""

When the driver arrived she told him that because there was not as many kids that she thought there were, she only wanted half of the order and would only pay for such. My driver stood there reeling in  this and was about to call the store looking for help, but thankfully this woman's awesome father spoke up.

Father: it's your own fault that you ordered too much, they did what you wanted, now pay them.

Woman: but...I don't need...

Father: it doesn't matter, pay the guy so he can get back to work.

Woman: (defeated) fine....

She ended up paying for her food, rather unhappily, and my driver recounted the story for me happily.

Awesome father teaching his adult daughter the joys of personal accountability.

Story 2

This one was more recent.

Ever since another area pizza competitor went down we've seen a massive spike in sales at our store, some days it seems like the whole town wants food at once and that can really slow us. Making our norman 20 to 30 delivery times take up to an hour. Most people who call in are warned of this and are usually totally fine of the delay (given proper warning of course).

So on this particular rush two scraggly looking dudes saunter in and order a few items and take all sorts of time doing so. The guy talking to me seems a bit off, and while the area I work in is known for meth abuse, I try and to just treat them like any other customer. His order is very confusing to take as he keeps changing it then going back, but seems grateful that the manager is helping him out.I then politley tell him that because of the rush his food should be ready in 15 to 25 minutes. No problem he says, and hangs out.

Now when a rush hits I literally am doing everything, iat one time I can be making an order, routing a driver, and making a pizza. This tends to put on quite a show for customers as they tip more and comment on how busy we are and such hard workers. (Also makes them less impatient seeing how hard we work to get their food)

Mr meth, well call him, keeps commenting on how great we are and such a hard working manager, which I humbly thank and then sprint to the next task. 19 minutes later he hustles outside for a minute, then comes back in PISSED. 

Mr. Meth : (rather frantically) I can't belive HOW long this is taking...I swear I deserve a refund. If it takes more than two minutes....120 seconds...two minutes, I am demanding a refund and walking out. You have two minutes.

Me: (suprised but sincere) sir I am extremley sorry about the time, it is pretty much out of the oven and we are cutting it now.

Mr.meth: I have seen the same driver go I  and out of this store with deliveries 3 times, how do these people get their food before me constantly?

Me: I am sorry about that sir but some of these people have been waiting an hour for their food, yours is coming up now. 

Mr. Meth: good and I'll bet you didn't even get my order right with all of my extra sauces
.
Me: (handing him order) here's your order with all the extras, exactly what you ordered, I am so sorry about the wait.

Mr. Meth: ridiculus....

The customer behind him gave me an odd look, and when I apologized to him for the wait on his food and offered a soda while he waited, he simply told me that he understands we are busy and that there is no need for compensation, and thanked us for our work.

So that does it for my stories for now. Sorry about any spelling or whatnot, phone stuff. I'll post more later if people seem interested.

skunkhairjones,74,,97,1fhw8i,,362,"I was a member of management of a big box retailer. I had seen that the service desk had a line and decided to help out the lone service desk associate. I asked if I could help the next person in line, the customer came up, and I proceeded to listen to her issue. I really don't remember what the issue was, they're all a blur. As she's explaining her needs I figure it was no issue at all and easily fixed. Just as I had started to go in to her order in our system the service desk associate finished up the customer she was working with and told me she'll take over. I politely told her that [associate] would help her and then proceeded to ask for the next customer in line.

""Excuse me,"" she says, ""you weren't done with me!""

""I'm sorry, I apologize if I didn't make it clear that [associate] would finish taking care of you,"" I replied.

""NO! You ignored me so you could help the next customer.""

""Ma'am,"" [associate] says to her, ""I can finish helping you. I heard your problem and I can take care of it for you."" 

Now she starts talking to [associate], ""did you see that? He went and helped her because she's white.""

""OHHHHHH, HELL NO"" I said in my head.

""I have a PhD, and he didn't want to help me so he could help her because she's white.""

Now, in my head I'm calling bullshit, because she doesn't look like a PhD in anything. She looked like the rest of the middle-lower class residents that made up our area. She did carry a canvas bag from some prestigious college. So, maybe it was possible. Regardless, I now had a choice to ignore it or address it. The customers in line had the same look I had on my face. All the while she's still going on and on about how because she was black and she's a PhD blah blah blah. I decided to address it.

""Ma'am, I apologize if I didn't make it clear to you that she was going to finish taking care of you. My focus was to try and assist all the customers as quickly as I could. [Associate] is much quicker at fixing your issue than I am, so she is going to take care of you. And I'm sorry that an extremely educated woman like yourself still sees things in color. If you'd like to talk to my manager about this issue his name is XXXX. My name is YYYY and he's over there in the aisle behind you.""

Needless to say that ended the whole ordeal and I continued to help the next customer in line who gave me a look of ""wow, what was that?"" 

I've had tons of bad, and good, stories in my retail career. This one was one of the very few that stuck out in my mind.",Customer pulled a race card. I threw it back to her face.,459,talesFromRetail
Bellestrange,15,,54,19v84n,,366,"So now that I finally got brave enough to post here (like 2 hours ago, sorry!!) I NEED to share more. This story though was actually awesome, and I wish it had been me who said it.

I work at one of the big corporate pizza places as a shift manager, coming on three years now. I have been training a new shift manager who has become a pretty good friend of mine in the process.

The other day, a customer and his wife came in who are known to lie their asses off the get free pizzas. Their numbers and names are flagged in our system. So they ordered, went home, and again, called to complain. I told this new manager (Tony from now on) the situation, and had him talk to them for practice with crazy customers.

I didn't hear the whole conversation, but this is what he told me when we were writing up the report.

Woman: (after being told she would not be getting free food or credits any more) I want to speak to a manager!
Tony: I am the manager, ma'am.
Woman: Well I hope you don't plan on being there long asshole, because after I'm done with YOUR manager you wont have a job!
Tony: Actually, I plan on being here FOREVER
Woman: Well that'll be a sad fucking life!
Tony: It'll still be better than being a 40 year old woman still trying to scam free pizzas out of [company name]!
And he then hung up on her. 

The store was in shock. The last part was the part I heard. I wish there could have been a slow clap, but we had to get back to work. Still, one of the best moments in my sad job. They still haven't called back.

TL;DR Customer was being a bitch, new manager bitched back.",Sweet revenge,420,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,140,,107,18ila0,,360,"So as I've stated before, I used to work for *Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch*.  In previous stories I've explained why I can't stand the company, due to their hiring practices. Towards the end of my time there, I was looking for a new job, already over the company.  This set of events however, was the last straw.

So most companies don't allow their employees to purchase or use gift cards.  It helps cut down on fraud and helps the LP keep track of the employee purchases.  Well, not *D*B*.  This was the only company I've heard of, let alone worked for, where not only could employees purchase gift cards, but could purchase them using their employee discount.  So a $100 gift card will cost the average associate $70.  Could be wrong but if I recall the employee discount was around 30%.

Anyways, ever since I had started, my manager would tell me this girl, who was an employee at a store about 30 minutes away, would come in frequently, and purchase $2000 of gift cards from each of the 4 stores, using her discount.  However no one seemed to ever recall her name, or when she was in.  So I never pursued it much.  However one day, I get a call from my Kid's store manager. She informs me that the girl has been in, and has her name, employee number, etc.  So when I get some free time, I jump on one of the store computers, and do a little digging into the girl's purchase history.

In a 7 month period, this girl had purchased well over $90,000 worth of gift cards using her discount.  No, that not a typo.  This part time employee, making not much more than $10,000-$15,000 a year, has spent the same amount in gift cards as a Senator spends on a high class hooker.  

Now, I consider myself an intelligent person.  But even if I was an idiot, I think I'd have noticed something about this just *maybe* didn't add up.  So naturally I call my boss and tell him of my findings.  Now at this point, me and my boss didn't get along.  He was a nice enough guy, but he was Alpha Male as fuck to the point it just went from annoying confidence to full out douchebaggery.   ""Do you even lift, bro"" will more than likely be engraved on this man's tombstone.  Most of our issues stemmed from paperwork. For some reason, *D&amp;B* still used fax machines.... Fax machines.  But it would send the fax to the emails of the regional managers.  So why we couldn't have just scanned it and emailed it, is beyond me.  But once or twice a week, I'd send a fax over to my boss, and weeks later he'd inform me he never received it.  Despite the fact that I always got a confirmation, it must be my fault. Whoa unto he who would dare suggest my that he was wrong about anything.

So I send off all the evidence, cocksure that all of my hard work would be rewarded.  After all, this was a big case.  A little leg work, and any proof that she was actively defrauding the company for personal gain, and I'd have a nice big case on my record.  Right? Well obviously not, otherwise I wouldn't be telling you all this. Idiot.

So several weeks go by,  and sure enough, she comes in again, another $6000 worth of gift cards, and off she goes, tra la la la la.
Dafuq?  So I send my boss a text, asking for an update on the case, and if he wants me to send over the new purchases as well to add it it.  My boss texts me back, saying that he never received anything from me in the first place. After several messages back and forth that basically consisted of ""Yes I did"" and ""No, you didn't""  I took  a screen shot of the email that HE HIMSELF forwarded to me  from his boss saying the case was passed on to Corporate LP.  But nope, I must send it all again, *correctly this time* so he can get it going....  So at this point I'm angrier than Paula Deen when she doesn't get her hourly stick of butter fed to her.  But I send it again, making sure to CC the Regional Manager.  Who of course responds with ""We already have this thank you.""  Derps....

Anyways, about a week later, my boss comes to give me a surprise visit.  We visit the stores, go over the numbers, he quizzes some of the employees on LP knowledge. The usual stuff.  Then when we go to the food court to have a 1on1.  During the course of the talk, he brings up the gift card purchases.  Here is, to the best of my ability, an accurate account of that conversation:

BromanBossman (hereafter referred to as BB):  So we got word back from Corporate on this girl and the gift cards.

Me: Oh yea?

BB: Yea, they said just to let her go.

Me: Oookay. Were they just not able to prove that she was reselling them?  

BB: The company just says to let it go.

Me: Ok but I want to just be aware if it was a problem on my end. If I screwed up I'd rather know about it.

BB: No, the company is getting money, so they don't see an issue.

Me:  Don't see an issue?  This girl has purchased over 10 times her salary in gift cards.  She's obviously selling them. And who knows what else! She's probably stealing from the stores too in order to get more money.  Is her store at least aware they should be watching her?

BB:  Im not sure. But as far as the company is concerned, its a lot of money coming it's way, and they aren't really losing anything since it still gets spent in their stores. So they want us to just let it go.

Me: That's insane.  

BB: It's what the company wants...


Well fuck that.  I naturally called up her home store, first chance I got.  I was informed that they knew about the girl, and were told to just keep an eye on her, as the company didn't see the point in investigating her, when they were getting money.  Such absolute bullshit.  I went on vacation a few weeks after that, and put in my 2 weeks while away.  I'm sorry if this isn't like my normal tales of idiocy, racism, and general retail shittyness, but it's something that needed to be told.

**TL;DR- I aint saying she's a gold digger.... But I'm not gonna finish that line because I'm white and enjoy that song.**

Edit:  Forgot to mention, the girl only had purchased one pair of clothes using her employee numbers. The rest were all gift cards.,'

Double Edit:  Have been informed that I am wrong- Gift cards can be sold.  It isn't fraud per se what she was doing, and any criminal case would be hard to prosecute, unless the acquired funds were being used in an illegal manner.  Otherwise it would just be a civil case.  Sorry folks!

Shawntae85,49,,81,1noh33,,366,"Having worked in retail for many years, I'm glad I have brothers and sisters in the good fight against rudeness, stupidity and downright fuck-tards. I have many stories, but this will be my first contribution. Not my juiciest but it always brings a smile to my face when I remember it.

Background: I worked at a popular fast food place in high school and for a few years after. Some franchises not only sold burgers and related items, but also had a Mexican food menu offered as well. I worked in one such store. 

Story: On this particular day I was working drive thru; the lunch rush hadn't started yet so I still had energy and a positive attitude. Enter Dumb Ass.

Me: ""Welcome to Derp's Jr., may I take your order?""

DA: *Boring, typical order* followed by ""and I want a Carne Asada Burrito.""

Me: ""No problem, can I get anything else for you today?""

DA: ""Yea, I want to know why EVERY time I order a Carne Asada Burrito, you give me steak. Why doesn't anyone ever offer me chicken?""

*Silence* 

I was pretty sure I was getting trolled and I was waiting for the customer to burst into laughter. Nope.

DA: ""Hello? Why don't I get offered chicken?""

Holy shit. This is a serious question.

Me: Doing my best to not sound condescending because I pride myself on good customer service ""Um...the burrito isn't offered in chicken because Carne Asada means steak...""

DA: ""Oh. Fine then."" Pulls forward.

Meanwhile, the entire back line is laughing because there is a speaker for drive-thru and they just heard this conversation. A few customers heard the exchange and were giving each other that 'Please tell me you heard that' look. My Manager just shrugs her shoulders at me. I had to answer the question. It's not my fault she didn't know. Maybe next time she'll think twice before giving attitude while asking a question she should know the answer to.

toxlab,37,,100,1n6z9k,,364,"I worked barista at a big bookstore/cafe. The dividing line between the restaurant and the books was an aisle that led to the bathroom. This meant that everyone who wanted to make a tinkle had to walk right past me.

There was a big problem with people taking books into the bathroom. Every time we discovered a toilet book, there were jokes about it being ""flagged"", like the Seinfeld episode. Of course, the reality was that the books just got reshelved. Especially since the area right outside the cafe contained a big shelf of ludicrously spendy art books. People would go to drop deuce and lug a ten pound gallery book in there with them.

Oh, and the pornography. Surprisingly, it wasn't the stroke mags that ended up in the Shame Stall. It was muscle magazines. These people were so confused about their sexuality that they couldn't buy their whacking fodder and go nuts at home. No. They would conceal a mag, get in a public stall, beat it, throw their fantasy boyfriend with the toned glutes on the floor, and dart out in a cloud of shame.

This starts to become an epidemic. I would go to the little boys room for an afternoon wee, and there would be multiple books in there. Swing back through a few hours later, and another pile of books would be there, getting scuffed and kicked along the floor. People would piss on them as well. Truly classy.

So now the stage is set. I'm at the counter, and everyone I see taking reading material into the bathroom gets hollered at. I don't chase them, but if someone breezes past me and I see books, then they return without them, I go into full public shaming mode and very loudly call them out on their bullshit.

A part of my job has become being the Bathroom Gestapo. I soon realize that the pigs doing this stuff do it again and again. A few are so bad that even after yelling across the dining room that they must retrieve their spent ammunition, they would still play coy and act like they had no idea what you were talking about.

One such case was Mr Dingdong. He was probably in his fifties, always well dressed, and had that kind of smug superior attitude that retail slaves enjoy so much.

He would buy books, get coffee, wander around for a while selecting magazines, and then away to the bathroom where he would get in the disabled stall and spank that monkey. Bi-curious fantasy material would then be dumped on the floor and he would bolt. He would do this more than once on the weekend. I found a mag covered in baby gravy one time and went back to the front and screamed at the boss that it had to be that asshole and he should be banned from the store. The boss was kind enough to understand my frustration, but said that since we couldn't prove it was him, nothing would be said.

Myself and my shift leader wanted none of that. We wanted vengeance. We vowed to drop everything else to spend our time surveilling DingDong. I didn't give a happy hamster's ass if you had to wait five minutes for your latte. I was doing something important, Goddamnit.

My shift leader was an awesome dude named Clark. He was remarkably tall and almost painfully slender. He looked like a goth scarecrow.

He had this amazing basso profundo voice that carried far and resonated wildly. It was always fun when he would sing to himself. Customers would ask him to say things and giggle when he drew himself up and announced stentorianly, ""We have a special on cranberry scones."" It was like working with James Earl Jones.

Clark goes to the bathroom and returns with a disgusted look on his face. Someone has left a trail of poo in the bathroom. Little nuggets litter the stall. I think no big whoop, and go to pick it up with some paper towels like you would for a dog's leavings.

No no no, says the bossman. Gotta cross the store, get a biohazard kit. Gotta sanitize the area after removal. End up mopping the whole bathroom because who's only gonna mop half?

We have an uneasy truce with DingDong. Either he's getting better at hiding his shameful urges or he's decided that waxing his pole in public isn't worth getting yelled at by someone who drinks a dozen shots of espresso a day.

We start getting more fecal displays in the loo. Little clumps the size of a Hershey's Kiss that end up getting stepped on or kicked and then tracked all over the hallway and into the carpeting. And this means more sanitizing sessions in the middle of the day when the joint is at it's busiest.

Clark posits that it is the work of one man based on the consistency of the droppings. He makes guesses about the guys diet and toilet behavior. It was kind of like that scene in Jurassic Park where Sam Neil gets up to his elbows in a steaming pile of triceratops dookie.

A few weeks of looking for our phantom pooper has our alarm bells cranked up to one hundred percent. We start following likely suspects into the shitter, waiting until they start crapping, and then leisurely washing our hands until they leave the stall. I'm sure there were a few nervous poopers who were denied their joy when we showed up and hung around.

Finally, we had our break. Clark went to drain the lizard and actually heard the sound of wet shit hitting the ground. In a rage, he stood on tiptoes to look into the other stall and found Mr DingDong with his pants down, ass facing the stall door, dropping bricks onto the floor while holding his garments out of the line of fire.

I became aware of the situation when DingDong came hustling out of the bathroom with Clark right behind him. I mentioned Clark's voice was piercing. The thunder he pulled up for yelling at DingDong was astounding. It was like the first performance of an opera with Tourette's syndrome.

When DingDong had vacated the premises, Clark returned and told us the story. The boss was concerned about fallout from Clark looking into the occupied stall. It wasn't like he climbed over the divider or anything, he was just super tall and happened to be able to see over if he flexed a little bit.

Still, the boss went to his boss to hash it out, and they decided an incident report needed to be written. Clark didn't quite know what to say, but I've always had a knack for colorful verbiage, so I interviewed him, wrote a rough draft, and then punched it up before writing on the form. I went nuts. That thing read like a Ludlum novel. You would have thought Clark had discovered the guy brewing chemical weapons in a hollow volcano lair. We also went to great lengths to remind our overlords that this dude was not only creating a health hazard, he was destroying company property through vandalism.

Add into the mess the cost of biohazard cleaning supplies and labor for cleaning the bathroom more frequently, and we had a great case against The 'Dong. Matlock couldn't have saved that motherfucker.

Corporate issued an official ban for DingDong, and there were machinations of preparing a case against him regarding his feces getting ground into the carpet. I don't know what ever became of that, but we had no more Mr DingDong.

We still found books in the lavatory, but knowing we were able to shut down a serial spunker, and then got his dumb ass in trouble for being a sadistic, passive aggressive fucker, was a sweet, sweet victory.

AshieeRose,18,,72,1n0z4c,,361,"I'm doing over triple the amount of hours on my roster this week because of one full-timer being injured and off on compensation, and another off on paid leave. There's a massive 70+ hour void in the roster that's had to be filled in such short notice. I and a few others had our rosters engorged - I'm working eight days out of nine.

In this time, I've gotten closer to regular customers, and my coworkers, who I'd usually be lucky to see once a week.

But today was a rare thing for me. I've led people around the store before, looking for items that they just can't seem to find, but today, I had to do all of a woman's shopping for her, as she led me around to what she wanted. 

She was a small elderly woman, of Asian descent, so sometimes her communication was a bit difficult. She was shopping for her husband, who had just been discharged from hospital. 

My manager picked me to go around with her. She picked out a cut of salmon, I ordered it for her. She only wanted two slices of the steak from the package she picked up, I asked a man from Meat Department to take some slices out. She needed bags of water, I lifted them up for her. Picked out the best looking blueberries, helped her decide what type of milk to get. Crossed out the items on her list as we went.

After all that, I opened a register and checked her cart out, lifting everything onto the conveyor and re-loading the cart with the bagged items. Then led her to a Grocery co-worker, who went outside and loaded her car for her. 

Before she left, I said that it was very nice to meet her, and hoped that her husband will be well. I was going to turn and head back to my register, when she threw her arms around me. 

She was crying into my shirt, saying thank you over and over, and despite trying as hard as possible not to, I started crying. In all my years in retail, I've never had a customer hug me. Plenty of thank you's and compliments, but never a hug - it caught me off guard something major. 

Today was a long day, but that woman definitely made my year. Such a wonderful (and adorable!) lady, I'll never forget her.

stopmotionradio,55,,63,16kv79,,358,"Back in high school I worked at one of the popular sandwich chains.  The other employees were just lazy and awful.  Without fail, someone would not show up to their shift every other night, and we would be short staffed through the dinner rush.  No one ever got fired over it.

One night I got to work and as the day shift people were clocking out, I noticed that no one else had shown up yet.  I called both employees and neither of them answered their phones.  So 5 o clock came and I was alone to start the dinner rush.  I called the store manager and he said it was my job to call other people and try to get them to come in and he wouldn't come in cause it was his day off.  Frustrated and with more people starting to get in line, I call the franchise owner and she gives me the same story, I have to call other people and try to get them to come in.  I try to explain that I can't do that and make sandwiches, check people out, and prep food.  She says to figure it out, and hangs up.  

In hindsight, I wish I told her ""Get someone down here to help me within 30 minutes or I am kicking every customer out, locking the door and leaving.""  But sadly I was a shy high schooler.  

So I am scrambling to make sandwiches as fast as I can with a line out the door.  This was a week after we started toasting sandwiches, so everyone wants their's toasted, which slows things down even more.  Then, as I am making a sandwich for a guy, it slides of the toasting tray and gets all over the floor.  I apologize profusely and start his sandwich over.  When he finally pays, he pays with a $50 for a 6 inch sub and drops ALL of the change in the tip jar.  This happened several more times throughout the night(though no more $50s)  By the time the night was over, I had over $100 in the tip jar and I don't remember a single angry customer.  A normal tip jar night would be $15 to split 3 ways.

After we closed, I made a tray of cookies and ate most of them.  It was a good night.

I've been working at Swedish international clothing retailer for a little under 6 years in Chicago and have recently gotten promoted to management (yay!)- I've acquired a *lot* of really ridiculous experiences, but this one is definitely top ten. 

We are a VERY busy store and encounter some, er, interesting individuals as a result of it. 

It was a grey and stormy Thursday, right after the usual lunch rush we gather, and the store is finally calming down from the chaos that is white business women buying 19.95 blouses. I was supervising the floor, and had two cashiers ringing out the final customers in line when I hear Associate ask for a manager, asap. 
Now usually, this entails either A) an over-entitled customer demanding they get a discount on an item that is only 3.95 to begin with or B) a simple issue with a merchandise credit.

Today however, was neither of those things. 

I head over to the registers and see a completely calm, well dressed young woman with one tank top, one pair of leggings, and one basic t-shirt neatly folded in front of her (now referred to as YW). As I go to approach the tills, my associate stops me and asks me to grab MY manager, who was restocking a table nearby. I oblige, grab Other Manager (OM) and this amazing interaction ensues:

**OM:** Hello Miss, what can I help you with?

And with a deep breath, YW responds in a dead-serious tone.

**YW:** I am sent from God. I am a messiah sent here to enlighten the earth. You will give me these items for free. I do not have to pay for them.

**OM:** (*eyebrow raised*) I'm sorry miss, we do have to charge you for these items, we don't give out things for free.

**YW:** *(dead-fucking-serious face)* No. You misunderstand. I am a messiah sent by God. LargeDepartmentStoreAcrossTheStreet will reimburse you for these items. I have too much money so they will not give me a debit card. I am loaning them my Star of David diamond necklace, and they will reimburse you in full. Now place these in a bag and give them to me.

At this point, OM is done playing the game. We get a lot of crazies, but this woman was off the charts. 

**OM:** I am not going to do that. You have to pay for these items. Will that be debit, credit, or ca-

Suddenly, the stormy sky parted, and the true rays of crazy went from 0 to 100 in about .5 seconds.

**YW:** NO! THOSE ON MY SIDE WILL BE SAVED, THOSE ON YOUR SIDE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS! I DO NOT PAY FOR THINGS, I AM GIFT SENT BY GOD. 

At this point, no fucks were given and OM demanded the customer leave the store- she was screaming obscenities and generally getting her crazy-juice all over.

**OM:** Miss, you have two choices: leave the store by yourself, or have security escort you out. Either way is fine by me. 

**YW:** IF ANYONE LAYS A HAND ON ME, THEY'LL GET POPPED OUTSIDE THIS STORE! YOU'LL BE DEAD AS SOON YOU WALK OUTSIDE!!! 

**OM:** Are you seriously threatening me right now?

**YM: I'M NOT THREATENING YOU, GOD IS THREATENING YOU!!**

Grifachu,129,,70,1a6amo,,360,"I worked in a small local store that sold a gourmet food product.  I'm a college student, so I work here during my Christmas break.  Who doesn't want a little extra money over the break?

So let's pretend it was cupcakes (it isn't, it's actually something harder to work with).  I showed up to work at 7:00 to get all of the orders ready for the day (we open at 9:00).  In the Christmas rush we often have people show up early.  If I get all of my work out of the way I will let them in, or if not I will duck behind the counter and pretend I don't exist.

So I'm putting together orders when I hear a knock on the door.  Damn, she saw me, I can't hide.  I tell her through the glass that we are closed, and that our hours are posted (on a large sign on the door).  She says through the glass ""The website said differently,"" so I let her in.  She then has me make a very complicated and large order.  Fuck, fine I'll make her damn order.  I'm starting to wish my coworkers would show up (we take turns coming in early).  Finally finished.

She then pulls out an American Express Gold card.

Me: ""Sorry, we don't accept American Express,"" I say casually.

Ms. American Express: ""You don't! What the hell kind of place is this!  You don't take money!"" She says this with the anger that only someone who thinks they are rich can manage.

What is happening?  It is too early to deal with this nonsense.

Me: ""I apologize, we do accept Discover, Visa, and Master Card.  We also take cash and checks.""

Ms. American Express: ""Do you know what this is?  This card has a hire spending limit than the cost of your car!""

I don't know the spending limit on her card, but I imagine it is high.

The day before my father had given me his credit card to pick up a gift for my mom.  I still had the card in my wallet to my delight.  I reach into my wallet and take out the card.

Me: ""This is an American Express Platinum card.  It isn't accepted here either.  We accept Visa, Discover, Master Card, checks, and cash.  If you don't buy this it will sell later today (the Christmas rush).""

She went to her car and brought back a check.

**TL;DR Platinum is better than Gold**

Yesterday I was running the seafood counter, about a hour before my shift was suppose to end  a lady comes up to my counter on her cellphone. I stop peeling shrimp and walk to greet her "" Hello miss, how are you doing today?"" She then replies "" Can't you see I'm on the phone, Leave Me Alone!"" Another customer is behind her in line, so I greet him and ask him what he would like. 
As he starts to say what his order is the lady on the cellphone interjects and says "" Excuse me! I was before him! "" I say to her, ""Miss, you told me that you were on the phone, I'm going to help this gentleman and then get to your order."" She replies with a "" whatever"" The male customer wanted the rest of my trout fillets an I said okay. I weighed them up and packaged them and sent him on his way. The female customer then says she wants three trout fillets and I tell her that I'm sold out. 
She then says to get more from the back ( it's Sunday and I didn't get a fish load so everything is from the day before) and I tell her I have none but I can get her something else. And she starts to walk behind my counter and try to get into my area. I then tell her that I'm calling the store manager. I manage to keep her out of my area until my manager get there.
 The customer then proceeds to tell my store manager that I refused her service and refused to get her the fish she wanted and how I cussed her out. 
My manager then tells her to walk up to the front of the store. 
 
I later find out that my manager banned her from the store for a year since she verbally abused me and gave me a $50 giftcard for being cooperative.

Dhenn004,42,,82,1qr32l,,360,"I've posted here before, and I mentioned I was a Movie theater shift manager. And I apologize this may get long.

Anyways to the story. It's Friday night, and it's busy, Thor came out last week and Catching Fire is next week so pre orders and Thor are making it absolutely nuts. It's also bringing the worst out of my employees (rightfully so, they are stressed) and the customers.

Anyways I digress. At our concessions we offer a free refill for MEDIUM and LARGE drinks and popcorn. It's to beat our competitors because they only offer on Large. Now, typically people who come out with a small and want it refilled I offer to let them pay the difference from a small to a medium and switch their cup for them. It's like 50 cents and most people accept. Not Today, Not this customer.

So this man comes out and wants a refill. My assistant manager politely tells the man that she is sorry but only MEDIUMS and LARGES get refills. 

**asshole:** ""Well one of your employees said I get refills.""

**Assistant Manager:** "" I'm sorry but our policy states-""

**Asshole** ""What, I don't care about your policy I want a refill"" At this point I hear him raising his voice so I start to walk over. But he just throws his cup on the floor and walks away before I can try to defuse the problem.

I shout across the lobby "" Come on man! We work hard to keep this place clean!"" Basically to make him guilty. (if it were even possible). I pick my Assistant up with the ""he's an asshole"" speech and we figure its over with.

Jump about 10 to 15 minutes later. We get a complaint about a man in a theater being loud and talking. With the same description of the man we just dealt with. I sigh and go in and stand in the corner so I can assess the situation without him seeing me. (If I'm seen, most of the time people stop right away and don't make a noise). I hear him and see him talking in the corner. It's the asshole.

I make my rounds, I walk up both set of steps make it seem like I'm not there for him. I walk to his side and stop a couple of rows behind him. He's still talking. I walk up to him and whisper for him to please be quiet. He stops talking for, I don't know, no more than 30 seconds? I ask again. Nothing is working on this guy!

He continues and I once a gain tell him to be quiet with a firm voice. Also I include the I will have you escort you out if you don't keep quiet. He just laughs right in my face. So I tell him to leave immediately.

**asshole:** "" make me HAHAHAHA"" Now this is getting the attention of everyone in the theater. 

**Me:** "" I have no problem calling the police, sir""

**Asshole:** "" Go ahead I'm not doing anything wrong""

**Me:** "" yes you are, you are disturbing everyone's movie experience, I've done this before and the police will be on my side on this""

**Asshole:** "" yea okay whatever, bitch.""

 I radio up to my assistant who has been right behind the projector upstairs and tell her to pause the movie. I announce to the crowd saying I'm sorry for the disturbance but I need to stop the movie so they don't lose their experience and miss out on the movie. (The whole point of me doing this is to call him out, maybe embarrass him). Well it worked but not in the way I expected.

I stands up and I see him ball his fist and bucking up to me. Typically in a business situation you can't fight back or do anything. I wasn't looking to fight this man so I back up to put some space between this guy and myself. He starts moving towards me, and I quickly as possible Radio up and tell my assistant to call the city police department. (911 wasn't needed).

He lunges at me so I just back up as quickly as possible. I'm a pretty quick guy so I easily just moved out of the way. But he tried to get even closer and pushed me. After that it was on baby! Actually not really, he pushed me and I just grabbed him by the neck and held him in a position so that he couldn't do anything. 

I asked him if he was done but he was just getting furious. He tried dipping out before the police showed but I was prepared and had the doors locked so if something like this were to happen I could keep him in the theater. He ended up hiding in the bathroom until the cops showed up. Several police asked other movie goers what happened. Let me off with a pat on the back and said I did the only thing I could do to stop him and arrested him.

captaingiggles,140,,79,1i31zn,,355,"I used to work in a computer store as a sales girl. Because we worked on commissions and I'm a young, fairly pretty, charmer, I made bank and also attracted a few too many admirers. Sorry about the length, but there's a few stories.

So I was still in training, hired for the gaming department, and for some odd reason everybody on the sale floor called out, so I wasn't even sure of my own department when I was suddenly thrown to the sharks. A middle aged man, around 45-50 years old flags me down and starts inquiring about learning a new language. So walk him over to our software aisle and suggest a brand. He picks up the home edition and I pick up the premium. He leans over to compare the difference and while doing so rubs the back of his hand against my breast. It wasn't a mistakable brush, he full on touched my boob with the back of his hand. I immediately excused my self, dropped the software back on the shelf and bolted to find either a manager or another employee. I made eye contact with a co-worker that I later wind up dating, who seemed concerned, but worked in customer service at the time, right before I get to him so he can hide me, the guy comes up from behind me, grabs my upper arm and says, ""You can't get away that easy."" I shrieked in surprise and that's when a manager meandered over and saved me.

Fast forward about a year, the co-worker from customer service and I are dating. We're stocking shelves across from one another, so we're face to face in different aisles, chatting. The shelves are fairly short, so I can see the top of his head. I see a couple walk towards him, so we quit talking and stock like good employees. The couple comes up to him and the husband says, ""Hi. We've seen you around and my wife and I would like to ask you if you'd want to be in a threesome with us."" Giggling to myself, I tiptoe and look at him. He makes the ""save me"" face, I shake my head, too amused at this situation and wondering how he's going to handle this. He immediately says, ""Well you know what? My girlfriend is in the next aisle over, I'd probably need permission from her."" He hurries over and starts with a ""Darling!"" in a sing song voice with a shit eating grin. I politely said I'm horribly selfish and I'd like to keep him all to myself.

The last story from this store was when I was in the customer service department. I was ringing up a huge line and a gentleman basically lurks in the impulse aisle right behind me. I don't pay to much mind to it because he's probably looking at batteries or something. But people keep asking him if he's on line and he keeps saying no, so it caught my attention. I turn around and ask him if he needs any help with anything. He says no and tries to start a conversation with me. I'm in the middle of ringing up a million people, so I just nod every once in a while and talk to my actual customers. He leaves and a few hours later comes back with his mother. They get on line and they wait for me to open up. She looks me up and down and says to me, ""You're not good enough for my son."" He smiles at me and hurries his mom out of the store scolding her and saying how he never should have brought her to meet his girlfriend. I was very confused.

After quitting the computer store, I started working the front desk at a hotel. I worked the night shift from 15:00 - 22:00 and came across quite a few characters. Besides your regular hookers and pimps, I can't even tell you how many times I've been asked if I want to make some money on the side, and just general crazies who never want to stop talking, I had one very funny encounter with a construction worker. 

""Hey, you're awful pretty for a chinese girl. Would you wanna come up to my room sometime and have a beer?""

""Oh no thank you, I'm too busy stealing american jobs.""

""Are you one of those girls that only date foreigners?""

reddit_user9001,75,,62,1hubwg,,362,"I work in a small sandwich shop for the summer time.  My fellow opener was running late so I had to run through everything and open up by myself.  We normally open at noon and I got in at 11.  

One of the first tasks is to set our benches in front of the store so if customers get there early they have some place to sit.  Just as I'm finished lugging these heavy benches out and about to go inside, this guy on a bike shows up and walks right in to the store with his bike and yells ""can anyone take my order?"" with me still outside. I walk in to give him the whole ""sorry not open yet, come back in an hour"" story and he says ""you're kidding me right?""

Me: ""No sir, we don't open till noon - our hours are clearly posted in front.""

Him: ""But you're here, you can just take my order.""

Me: ""Actually I can't because we aren't ready to take customers.  If you come back at noon, you can be the first.""

Him:  ""You should open for *me* now""

Now I'm thinking 'who the eff are you thinking you can barge and expect service.'  I just want him out of my store so I can get ready for other people to come in.

So I don't budge.

Me: I can't do that, I'm sorry.  Nothing is ready yet.

Him:  But I'm hungry *now*.  What are you going to do about that?

Bossing like a pro, good busy club night with ""Big Dubstep Act"". Loving the music, loving the outrageous drinks prices getting us all them lovely GreenQueens.

Big act just comes off stage, we have 2 more small DJs before close in 2 hours. Cue Rush at the bar. Imagine the Simba fleeing scene from antelopes(?) in Lion King to get an idea of the rush we now have on. 

Staff are ready, we bust a nut and all seems well, I'm serving along side them. Loving being with my staff.

All of a sudden I get approached by SmallLass. Really. She's tiny, 4""10 and barely the size of my leg. (I'm 6""6 22 stone, she and another girl once got in a leg of my trousers each and pretended to be Tweedledum and Tweedledee). And her eyes are the red of  someone on the verge of breaking into tears.


Get the lowdown: Customer has insisted she's got the order wrong twice (not likely) and has started shouting at her. I send her to the back with a cigarette (I keep a pack on the bar for moments like this) and a free vodka and coke to calm down. 

Not on my watch. LOCK AND LOAD I'M GOING IN HOT MOTHERFUCKERS.

DF: ""I just want 4 Vodka and diet cokes, and 5 Jagerbombs. THESE *gestures to drinks in front of her* are not DIET!""

Moi: *pick up a vodka and coke and down it in one like a boss* ""yeah, the Coke Syrup is a little off *BullShit++* i'll get you fresh"" - What do I care, i'll sell 'em by the end of the night. ""So 4 Vodka Diet Cokes, and 5 Jagerbombs?""

DF: ""YES!"".

Put the game face on, get my Bar on, Drinks ready in 60 seconds, I am Nick Cage.

Put them down in front of her, Triumphant.

DF: ""I said 4 Jagerbombs and 5 double Vodka Cokes!"". - I see why SmallLass was upset now, its frustrating. ""God, SmallLass got it wrong too, this bar sucks!"".

Put on my best manager face. You know the one, where you relax all muscles.

Moi: ""No, you ordered 4 Vodka Diet Cokes and 5 JagerBombs. I got you to confirm this, and you've already upset SmallLass, either pay for these or go away. If you do not remember your order I am to assume you are too drunk to keep drinking."" I STRIKE YOU DOWN WITH LOGIC YOU HARRIDAN OF THE NIGHT.

I head out back to grab my own smoke, plan is forming in the Stygian pits of my mind. I grab the security radio too. DF, your night is over.

I radio security channel 3. The one for the top guys, the reactors. The units who spend their night being hauled to incident after incident. I inform them a certain Orange Hooded DF has been spotted by a member of staff selling drugs in the toilet. I know these lads are licensed to search.

Simon the Lebanese Powerlifter comes over to get a more detailed description. I give him one. He points her out over the crowd, I confirm. 

Now, I didn't see the rest, but I got some good info from Simon and the CCTV. She put up one hell of a fight on the way to the First Aid/Security room. Screaming that they couldn't just search her. We Can, by entering you give us this power (standard club procedure). Simon eventually searched her bag to find another 12 Ecstasy tablets, 3 joints, and a small bag of unidentified white powder.

Holy shit, I know people enjoy the odd pill, but she was packing enough to be charged with possession with intent to deal.

She had all her gear confiscated as Police had a response time of 1 hour (classy northern towns on a Saturday). She was banned form the premises for life, and had her pic added to the wall of Infamy. 

I got the print out and gave it to SmallLass. Finally see a smile return to her face.

mermaidhairnoocares,130,,59,17ym4e,,360,"I think my all time most hated type of customer are the preteen girls. You know the type, middle school ""popular"" girls, dressed in glitter and Limited Too or Justice or whatever, and hideous, overpriced ugg boots. The worst part about these girls? It's not that they come in packs of at least 5, it's not even that they destroy the store, thought that is a good reason to hate them. No, the worst thing about these bitches, is the fact that they have absolutely no money and yet they come to the mall acting like they own the damn place. 

In the back of my store, we have a shelf that seats a hollow wooden box thing in which about 300 total nail polish containers sit on and inside of. Next to this shelf hangs like 40 belts, underneath the shelf sits like 10 pairs of shoes. Above the belts is our jewelry. 

One day while working, a pack of wild preteen girls come in, and head straight for the back and start looking at the jewelry. And though we have about a zillion bracelets, and they pretty much all look the same, one of the girls decides that she wants to look at a bracelet on the very tippity top of the rows upon rows of bracelets.  And of course it would be out of the question to ask me for help getting it down! No, no that would be ridiculous. Obviously the most logical thing she could do, was to CLIMB up onto the shelf with the nail polish to reach up to get the bracelet. Now our shelves were not made by ancient Egyptians. Our shelves are basically tin foil sheets zip tied to the wall. Not too sturdy. So when I turn around to see her knee up on the shelf and her friend hoisting her other leg up, I politely say ""Miss, I'm sorry but could you please get down from there? The shelves aren't able to hold human weight. May I help you get something down?"" She declines my offer, and steps down. They start to look at the lower rack of bracelets, which satisfies me so I turn around and greet customers. All of a sudden, I hear the sound of a thousand angels being brutally murdered behind me. Or maybe it was the sound of 300 nail polish containers, a shelf, and a wooden block crashing to the ground. This bitch, as soon as I turned around, started to climb up again, RIGHT AFTER I ASK HER IF SHE NEEDS HELP.  Her weight, as I said, was not supported, and the shelf came crashing down, causing neon, glittery, PERMANENT nail polish to splatter everyfuckingwhere. It created a tie dye of colors across the floor, splashing onto the belts, the shoes, everything. And you know what these girls do? They laugh. They hysterically laugh. It's just too funny so funny HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH. I'm fuming. But oh, it gets worse. They proceed to tip toe through the nail polish, and leave a track of ugg boot nail polish tracks across the floor that was previously not effected by the fall. And they are still laughing. Payless shoes is next to my store, and at this point my manager had had enough. He goes up to them, breaks up their giggle fest, and says ""You better take those shoes off and haul your asses to payless before I call security on you."" They think this is even funnier, and they strut out of the store.

We ended up having to damage out about 4,000 dollars worth of merchandise. Not only that, but my manager had to drive to the nearest beauty supply store (on the other side of town) and buy a gallon of nail polish remover, which we had to dump on the floor and scrub for 3 hours.

StevieDedalus,57,,98,164j62,,359,"Years ago, I worked for an electronics chain called Sadio Rack (or something like that).  I was something of a nerd, and thought I would try my hand at some retail.  I was assigned to a store, not in the best part of town, where the manager had been shot and killed in a robbery the year before.  

The new manager had dreams of being in the police force, himself. Sadly, he was something like 400 pounds (181Kg) and was unable to pass the physical requirements.  He seemed like a no-nonsense kind of guy, though, and would drive me - his only employee - to reach for perfection.  Dollar counts at the end of the day had to be perfect, closing procedures had to be followed to the 'T'.  Any mistake was met with stern shouts and warnings.  At his suggestion, I spent many an hour working off the clock in order to make my hourly quota.  My numbers looked OK at this infrequently visited store, but only artificially so.

His deep and abiding affection for the police led him to do things like give away a free $30 antenna with each police-bought CB radio.  This was a ""managerfromhell's special."" In other words, he simply carried the given-away antennas on inventory. I wonder if he ever thought about what would happen when the house of cards would fall.

This was not all, unfortunately.  No, the cards were piled much, much higher.  One day, our dollar count was off by almost exactly 20 dollars.  Strange, why 20 dollars...I thought I had done well keeping track? After a while, the manager explained that he was a bit short, and lent himself 20.  So I was to simply add that 20, then 30, then 40 to the end of each day until payday (we carried a certain amount in the till, and deposited the rest...the till amount kept shrinking, except on paper).  

You might think this is quite enough - unfortunately, you would be wrong.  The cards were piled higher still. If he had an interest in a certain item, a new kind of walkie-talkie or computer game or video camera, he would cut open the shrink wrap, pull out the item and use it at home for a couple of weeks.  When he lost interest, he would bring the item back, and carefully tape the shrink wrap (if any) back in to place.  

It didn't take long for me to become really uncomfortable with these activities.  It was simply the wrongness of the entire situation that got to me.  When I would talk to him about it he would say, ""C'mon Stevie - who are they gonna believe...Me, the guy with friends in the police, a guy who has worked for the company for several years, or you!?!""  I started looking for another job, and became somewhat depressed.

**His Undoing**

It is strange how I felt guilty in the end being the unwitting instrument of his destruction.  Each store could look into the inventory of other stores.  In this way, if one store were out of an wanted item, they could see if a nearby store had one.  Sometimes, the salesperson would jump in their car and drive over to pick things up while the customer waited - in order to not lose a sale and that sweet commission.  In the end, a salesperson from the closest store called asking for a pair of walkie-talkies.  I looked in our inventory to confirm, and said ""yes, we have them,"" and we hung up. Then I looked on the shelf - oops, the boxes were empty.  I called the other store.  ""Sorry, managerfromhell still has those at home,"" I blurted out, not considering the consequences.  

The next day, the district manager called to talk to me. ""Does managerfromhell still have that stuff at home?""  ""Yes,"" I said, knowing the game was up.  Within an hour, the DM and a loss prevention specialist I had never seen before were in the store.  They went back to the office while I watched the store.  Finally, managerfromhell emerged.  Choking back tears he said, ""just...don't do....what...I have done.""  And the house of cards finally collapsed.  They said they wouldn't press charges, if he would bring back everything he took home and repay any money he had out - but he was, obviously, fired.  The DM told me later if he had known the extent of it, he wouldn't have offered the deal.

I didn't last long after that.  I got a job as a computer guy in a data center and have never gone back to retail.  My sympathies though, if you get a boss like I did.

**Note:** I used to have the phrase ""and my mind is not for rent to any god or government"" tattooed on my chest. It was bastardized Rush lyrics. Stupid, I know. It is now covered with a badass pterodactyl. Now, back to the story:

Me: Thank you! It says, ""and my mind is not for rent to any god or government.""

CL: *Eyes narrow* So you don't believe in God?!?

Me: Well it's actually lyrics from a song, but no, I don't. 

(I say this in the sweetest way possible)

CL: So, you think we ""evolved"" (Yes, she used air quotes) from monkeys? Then why are there still monkeys? *Snort-laugh*

Me: Well no, but I know that we evolved from a common ancestor which we share with monkeys. That's what I learned in school. 

(At this point I am really trying to end this conversation, not be le brave or anything)

CL turns on her heal and walks toward the door. Just as she opens it, she turns her head and drops this:

CL: Ya know, you really shouldn't believe everything you read.

Me: Right back at'cha!

The lady never returns for the bread that she was picking up *for charity* because she didn't like my stupid tattoo. Yeah lady, real Christ-like.


Addendum:

I told my boss about it later because I wanted to give him a heads up about a potential complaint, and this is how it went down:

Bossman: So this was a charity person?

Me: Yup. From [local church].

Bossman: Wait, so she didn't *buy* anything?

Me: No.

Bossman: Aw, well fuck her then!


I realize this sounds like an /r/atheism wet dream, but I assure you it happened in my real life, and my comeback was really that quick. I'm not usually so good at thinking on my feet--especially when it comes to problem customers--so it was a good day for me.

badpatchcable,101,,76,19b532,,355,"Many moons ago when I use to work retail, I worked in a gameshop in a fairly large local mall. A mom come walking in with her punk kid. Kid comes straight to the counter and demands a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4. I look at the mom and she nods her head so I start to ring up the game.

Since it's rated M for Mature I inform the mom that ""This game is rated M for Mature due to content such as sex, violence, drugs, language and other things."" And at this point I notice the gold cross necklace and looks like she came out of Sunday church and being the good parent she is, she asks for more details.

Kid is looking kind of nervous at this point so I decide to help out by telling the mom ""This is the only game I know where you can hire a prostitute, do the deed and then kill her to get your money back.""

The look on the mom's face was priceless; pure anger. She turns to her son and says ""Wait till your father gets home"" and starts to drag him out. Kid stares at me with pure hatred and then goes into absolute terror when he sees how pissed his mom is.

I work as a cashier at a small hardware store. Our store is only staffed by a few people at a time, because it's usually so empty, but this means that when it does get busy, we are quickly overwhelmed. Today was one of those days.

I greeted one customer at the front door, our usual ""hello welcome to (store name) can I help you find anything?""

He responded with ""leave me alone and let me think."" So I did, and went to ring up the customer who had come to the register.  As I was doing so the awful customer came up to me, and talking over me ringing up the other customer, said ""I need ten bags of dirt.""

I told him that I was with another customer, and asked for a minute. He responded by clapping his hands and saying ""chop chop"". I finish ringing up the other customer while he stands there continuously looking at his watch and asking how much longer this will be.

Now we stock like 4 kinds of dirt, so I asked the man what kind of dirt he wanted. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""just plain dirt.""

I grabbed some bags of topsoil, and started to throw it in the cart while he stood at the register tapping his feet. When I bring it to the register he says that he actually wanted peat moss, and asks me if there's anyone else who can help him. There isn't because everyone else is busy, which causes him to sigh.

I finally ring him up and he just stands there staring at the cart full of dirt and says ""well?""

""Well what"" I said. Aparently he wanted me to load this all in his car as well, which is a reasonable request, that older customers usually do, but he seems like a fit thirty something.

I tell him that since I'm on register, I can't leave the store, but I offer to get someone else to help him with that. He says that that would be good and stands there in the way of the other customers while we wait for my 50-something coworker to help him out to his car with the peat.

He mutters something about kids these days and walks out of the store with my coworker. My coworker loads the dirt into his trunk while he sits in the front seat.

After this my coworker comes back into the store angry saying that the customer yelled at him for not putting a tarp down in the back first, not that he said that ahead of time, and then asked my coworker to hurry up, because ""he had the air running"".

Usually, when a customer is being awful, their behaviors can be justified by a person having a bad day, or something like that. But I have no idea how you would excuse behavior like this. Basically I couldn't believe it, I have literally never had any customer come even close to being this rude. It left me angry and frustrated for the rest of the day.","I don't hate people, just this person",420,talesFromRetail
TheLogicaldan,16,,82,1i05vu,,354,"I work at a grocery store and I'm not going to lie, from the way that people talk on this subreddit about the horrible people that come into there stores, my store is filled with some pretty nice people. At worst, we have people that just don't want to talk, but hardly ever any people that get mad at us. 


So after working about 5 hours this past Sunday it was time for my break. I bought some chicken from the deli and stood in line when a guy came up behind me in one of our electric carts. He had his stuff in the basket of the scooter and it looked like he was having a little bit of trouble getting his stuff up on to the belt. So I went and grabbed some of his things and put it on the belt for him. He said thank you and asked, ""So what's up?"" 

I just said, ""Nothing much, just going on break""

He then looked at the cashier and said, ""Let me pay for his things"". (The total was about $6.50). 

I honestly just stood there for a second because I had no idea how to react because this has never happened before. Part of me thought he was joking so I wasn't sure what to do. But no, he was serious, bought my things, and started talking to the person bagging (the bagger also works at a bar and the guy recognized him from the bar) about how he can't wait for ladies night. Then he said have a good day an left.


It honestly made my day, and I hope to god I thanked him because I honestly am not sure (I might have just stood there like an idiot) but the bagger said I did so yea.

So yup, my store is boring and nothing interesting really happens, so there is my short story.

She works for a big box retailer, one that has a full grocery section, and is the nearest store of it's type to five different colleges/universities in our area.  She's also in her last semester at a major public research university.

It was two days before school began, and a lot of returning students were buying groceries, apartment furnishings, school supplies, and the like.  

Haylee noticed that one girl had on a shirt from the university that she attends.  She strikes up a conversation with the girl, who is a freshman majoring in biochemistry.  Haylee is a genetics major, so she recommended a few professors and classes and wished her luck.  All good, right?

The guy behind her in line was listening in on this entire conversation.

GUY: So, you're a genetics major.  
HAYLEE: Yeah! Do you also go to [university]?  
GUY: Yeah, hah, but I have a real major.  
HAYLEE: Excuse me?  
GUY: Let's be honest here.  The only reason you're in genetics is because you're too stupid to get into an engineering major.  If you had any sense or brains you'd be an engineer.  
HAYLEE: It's actually more difficult to get into the College of Biological Sciences than the College of Science and Engineering...

TerriBadger,57,,68,1dgjzs,,355,"First off, I'm sorry for getting kind of... verbose.

I work at a coffee shop you'd never guess the name of, hawking quadruple-shot extra-dry French vanilla soy cappuccinos and other brazenly overpriced espresso-based beverages. My particular store has a drive-through, and that is where this story takes place.

It is a beautiful spring afternoon, which I get to enjoy for ten seconds at a time whenever I open the window to hand out drinks. Business is steady; we're not in a rush, but there's a few cars in line. Cue She-Devil on the speaker, ordering a skinny-- wait, I should probably anonymize drink names too. She orders a *svelte latte macchiato with extra extra caramel sauce.* (Please note that if you ever order a drink *svelte* and then ask for extra extra caramel sauce or, god help you, whipped cream, your barista is silently judging you.)

Shortly thereafter she arrives at the window. Her appearance is irrelevant, but for the sake of narrative accuracy, please imagine a [skeksis.](http://i.imgur.com/XTAE9y2.jpg) The skeksis rolls down the window of her minivan and extends toward me a gnarled claw, clutching a bank card in its ghastly talons. I swipe the bank card. The bank card is declined. Oh, dear.

As a show of good faith, I swipe the bank card again, even though this never works. At this point I insert myself into her phone conversation to bring the matter to her attention, my face and tone apologetic. I know it's embarrassing to have a card declined, and I feel bad whenever I have to tell someone. Usually, though, they don't just snap at me- ""You just have to ring it as **debit!**"" An exaggerated eyeroll, and she's back to the phone. Now, our registers don't have an option for debit (even though I doubt that would make a difference.) Every card that isn't a store card gets run through as credit. I inform her of this (once more integrating myself with her dialogue) and she expresses her disappointment in a calm, rational manner, after which we share a good-natured chuckle and she drives off to her kid's soccer practice.

No, actually, she gets all snippy with me, because clearly this is all my fault. I wait until she has to pause for breath, and then begin with, ""If you don't have another way to pay, I can-"" but I don't get a chance to finish that thought, because she interjects with a sharp ""*Just forget it!*"" and then pulls speedily away, I imagine, plowing over an elderly couple on the crosswalk.

The funny thing is, if she'd managed to contain her seething vitriol for just a couple of seconds, I'd have finished saying ""...I can comp your drink for you today."" We're allowed to do that occasionally, because it makes for happy returning customers. She'd have gone on her way with a gratis drink, presumably to go ask her bank about her faulty card. As it is, she left angry and drinkless, and her *svelte* macchiato was given a dignified burial at sink.

woofle07,59,,81,18xxq0,,358,"I apologize in advance for this story's extraordinary length, but I honestly believe that it is worth the read. This happened over the summer as I was working my part time job at a movie theater. I was sitting behind the guest service desk near the front doors, just shooting the shit with my manager, when this old man came storming out into the lobby from the hallway, screaming ""WHERE IS THE MANAGER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT?"" My manager, a very tiny woman named Mary, spoke up, asking ""what's the problem, sir?""

Entirely ignoring her question, the man continued screaming. ""I WANT THAT MAN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH ASSAULT! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!"" Mary persisted, asking again, ""what's wrong, sir?""

""HE REPEATEDLY KICKED THE BACK OF MY SEAT EXTREMELY HARD, AND WHEN I TOLD HIM TO STOP, HE GAVE ME THE FINGER AND CONTINUED KICKING! I WANT THE POLICE CALLED NOW!""

""Okay, was this a kid?""

""NO, IT WAS A FULL GROWN MAN TWICE MY SIZE. IF IT WAS A KID I WOULD HAVE KICKED HIS ASS!""

Mary's eyes widened in shock at this statement, and I broke in to the conversation. ""Okay sir, I'm going to go talk to this guy,"" I said, grabbing a flashlight and a walkie-talkie. The entire time we were walking to the auditorium, Uncle Scrooge continued on and on about how angry he was and how young people these days had no respect for their elders. He entered the dark theater ahead of me and took a seat right next to his wife on the very end of the row. There was no one behind him.

""Sir, where is this guy?""

""Right over there!"" he snarled, pointing at a group of three guys one row back.... and about 15 seats over.

As I approached the men, I noticed that they were regulars, who I saw around three or four times a month. One of the guys immediately spoke up. ""Is this about the old guy?""

""Yeah, he says you were kicking his seat and then flipped him off when he told you to stop.""

""With all due respect,"" regular guy replied, ""that's bullshit. It was dark when we were walking in, and I stumbled walking up the stairs. I fell onto the back of his chair, and before I could even apologize, he started screaming and stormed off.""

""That doesn't really surprise me. You guys have never caused any trouble while you were here, and frankly, this guy just seems like an angry old prick. Just do me this favor: if you need to get up for anything during the movie, use those stairs over there, and not the ones by his seat."" They agreed, and I turned to head back out of the theater.

Well apparently, me exiting without these dudes in handcuffs didn't jive well with Father Time, so he grabbed his wife by the wrist and stormed out of the theater again.

""Sir, are you not going to stay for your movie?""

(the following were this man's exact words. I am exaggerating absolutely nothing he said.) ""NO! I AM NOT SITTING IN THE SAME AUDITORIUM AS THOSE BARBARIANS! I AM A 77 YEAR OLD MAN, AND I DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT! IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PROTECT MY RIGHTS AS A SENIOR CITIZEN THEN I WILL NOT BE SPENDING MY MONEY HERE! FURTHERMORE, I WILL SEE TO IT THAT *YOU* DO NOT HAVE A JOB HERE ANYMORE!""

I actually had to turn away from him so I didn't laugh in his fucking face.

Upon hearing her employee being ruthlessly screamed at, Mary stepped in again, trying to defuse the situation. ""Sir, would you like me to refund your tickets?""

""NOT UNLESS YOU CAN REFUND MY TICKETS FROM THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, AS WELL AS THE $56 LEFT ON MY GIFT CARD!""

""Sir, I can't do that. I can only refund your ticket purchase from today--"" Mary was cut off as the angry customer threw his ticket stubs at her face.

""FINE! I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY! I'LL JUST TAKE PRIDE IN KNOWING THAT I WILL DO ALL IN MY POWER TO SHUT THIS HORRIBLE ESTABLISHMENT DOWN!"" (I honestly wish I was making this shit up)

Her mouth was actually hanging open in disbelief at this guy. I wish I had gotten a picture because it was the most hilarious thing I'd ever seen. (And kinda cute too, if we're being entirely honest here)

He stomped out the door, and Mary and I both burst out laughing. It was the most absurd situation we'd ever witnessed. That is, until I noticed he wasn't gone yet. ""Oh shit, now he's yelling at customers out in front of the box office.""

Mary told me to get on the phone and get ready to call the police while she went out and told him to leave. When she opened the door, I heard something about how we are a horrible company only trying to cheat them out of their money, and that there's nobody running the projectors and our movies weren't even going to play. ""Sir, you need to leave. Now."" Mary wasn't playing nice anymore.

""YOU SEE? THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE RUNNING THIS ESTABLISHMENT!""

That was the last straw for Mary. ""Get out of my theater now, or we will call the police. I will not ask you again."" I stood just inside the door, deliberately pressing one button at a time on the phone, slowly typing out the number of the local police station while staring this man in the face.

""FINE! BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER GIVE YOU MY BUSINESS!""

""Good,"" she replied coldly. ""We don't want you here.""

Fuming and too furious for words, he grabbed his wife's arm and dragged her out the front door. A few customers clapped, while most just looked confused. ""And fuck you too,"" I said as he drove away.

Whenever there is a commotion, I always go check it out, just to make sure everything is fine and dandy.

hate_tank,62,,105,14gvoi,,358,"Long time reader; First time poster/\.

I sell cell phones and cell phone accessories. If you are signing a 2 year contract, you have 14 days to return the phone before the contract officially starts. If you want to return the phone, you need to have the box, everything that came with the phone, and, most importantly, the phone must be in “new and re sellable condition”. Easy enough, right? Well, not for one guy.

This guy comes in with a Galaxy S 3 that he purchased in a town hours away from my store. Which is kind of weird. Why not return it in the town where you probably actually live? He wanted to return it because he “wanted to wait for the new one.” Uh, ok. He hands me the receipt and it’s torn in half so that the bottom of it is missing. There are also holes in it. Like he put it in a hamster cage or something. So I look up the original receipt in the computer. He bought it 12 days ago. Keep that in mind. 12. Days. Ago. I go to the back room to grab the receipt off the printer and tell the story to my boss. My boss gets a confused look on his face.

Boss: Did he ask for me?

Me: No. Was he supposed to?

Boss: Yeah. He tried to return the phone at another store. The phone had been beat to hell. The District Manager even said not to take it back.

Me: Fuck. This is gonna be fun.

I head back out and inspect the phone. Sure enough, beat to hell. Scratches all over the battery cover and chunks were taken out of the metal lining that curves around the front. It honestly looked like he threw it down a flight of stairs. My phone is over a year old and is in better condition than the GS3. There were no scratches on the screen though. I took a deep breath and dove in head first.

Me: Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to return this for you.

Customer: [blank stare] Why not?

Me: Because of the condition. It’s got scratches all over the back and there are chunks taken out of the metal part. (I then point at the damaged areas)

He then snatches the phone out of my hand like a child who’s about to cry, “I’m taking *MY* football and going home!”

Customer: Naaaawww, they’re not so bad.

Me: Yeah, they’re pretty bad. The phone has to be in new and re sellable condition for returns.

Customer: Why? It’s before 14 days.

Me: It is before 14 days, but it looks like you’ve had this thing for months.

Customer: Phones get dropped. I work in the [redacted] Service Center. I know that things drop.

Me: Why didn’t you get a case? That would have prevented the damage.

Customer: They didn’t have the one I wanted. It needed to have a kick stand on it. I had the screen protector on it. There’s no scratches on the screen so it’s ok. It's not all messed up.

Me: Regardless of that, the phone is not in mint condition, to put it in comic book terms. (He doesn’t get what I’m saying so I try to dumb it down.)

He then picks up the tattered remnants of his receipt, looks at is through the hamster  gnaw marks for about 2 seconds and exclaims smugly, “It doesn’t say that on here.” Ok smartass. Time for some schoolin’ and baby I ain’t foolin’. 

I take the receipt from him, turn it over and read aloud the line about new and re sellable condtion.

He scoffs. Scoffs like a rich white lady when told that she can’t park her BMW in a fire lane.

Me: If the phone came from the warehouse looking like this I would not sell it to a customer. *I* wouldn’t even want this phone. (That pissed him off. He started looking at me as if I just said, “You know,  Hitler had some good ideas, but just went a little too far.”)

Customer: That’s a shitty way of weaseling out of a return. (He actually said weaseling. That’s the first time in my life that I had ever heard anyone seriously use that term. I was expecting him to call me a jive turkey next.)

Me: It’s actually not. You hold responsibility for keeping the phone in good shape. Right?

Customer: Whatever. Let me talk to your manager.

Me: The one you were supposed to ask for? Sure. Hang on. (His expression turned from anger to slight shock.)

I grab the phone and go to the back office. I hand the phone to my boss. He inspects it and gives me a WTF look

Me: I know.

The boss calls the DM and tells him the scoop. He hangs up and sighs.

Boss: Go ahead and do the return.

Me: WHAT!?!?

Boss: Hahahhaha! Just kidding. Don’t do it. If he wants to escalade (yes, he actually said escalade. As in the car) it then he can call the DM. Another store manager already looked at the phone and said it was in horrible shape, so we ain’t taking it either.

Me: That works for me.

I head back out to floor and tell the customer what the DM said. Have you ever seen any Hulk Hogan wrestling match? You know when Hulk starts getting beat down and the crowd is cheering for him? With every blow Hulk regains more and more strength until finally he Parkinsons out the pain, locks eyes with his opponent and Hulkamania runs wild? You know about that, right? Well, that’s what I thought the customer was going to do to me. I was about to get the big boot to the chest and then have a leg dropped across my neck. But instead of that I got a bunch of mumbled curses.

Me: You can call our DM if you want. He was the one that ultimately made the call on this after the other store denied your return.

Customer: Can you call him? 

Me: We.. . just… did. I told you what he said.

Customer: Gimme his number. (How about please?)
I wrote down the DM’s number as the customer packed his hamster trodden receipt and stair case ruined phone away. I hand him the card with the number on it, and he, of course, snatched it out of my hand.

We have these huge windows in the front of the store where we can see the parking lot. After the customer left, he sat in his van for about 5 minutes. Not doing anything. Just sitting there. A thousand yard staring into the store. I could see him. He could see me. He finally started up his van. He put it in gear and laid on the gas. The van smashed through the front of the store, sending  shrapnel of glass and wood into innocent shoppers. I leapt though the air and grabbed a small child mere moments before a giant shard of glass decapitated him. I landed and handed the child back to his grateful mother. She started to tearfully thank me, but I hand no time for gratitude. I had a job to do. I spun around and pulled my twin .45s from their holsters and rained lead death into the cab of the now bloody van.  His body exploded in blood and carnage as the van finally came to a stop near the blank media section of the store. I cautiously walked over the broken bodies of people who just “wanted to look around”. I approached the driver side door and found that the assailant was still alive. Barely, but still alive. He tried saying something but choked on his blood. He spit it out and hoarsely whispered, “Do my return.” I turned to the camera, took the cigar out of my mouth, and said, “All sales final.”

It was either that or he just drove away without incident.

The lunch rush is over in a popular fast-food restaurant and some post-lunch stragglers are crawling in. A 20-30 year old man comes up and orders his meal. Burger combo and 6 nuggets. He's a nice customer, friendly enough to start a conversation. I pack his meal, he pays and I send him on his merry way to eat in the restaurant.

10-15 minutes later more customers roll through and stand a fair way away from the counter, quietly gazing upon the menu boards in unison. 

Someone starts walking up to the counter, finally. Oh it's nice guy.

Umm okay, that's probably because that's what food does. ""Sorry about that, I'll replace them for you.""

Me: ""Well, yes, they must have been sitting there for over 10 minutes.""

Guy: ""They're COLD. They were COLD when I got them!""

Me: ""I highly doubt that. Again, they have been sitting there for a while.""

Guy: ""But I was eating my burger!""

There was a momentary pause between us as I processed what he just said. As he kept berating me for new fries I peered at the other customers who were now exchanging looks.

""THIS IS STUPID!!"" He shouts, and storms out of the restaurant. Glad to say I haven't seen him since.

legomaniac89,60,,54,1ddsau,,353,"Here's yet another story from pet store land. This one involving one of my biggest facepalm moments in the history of my job.


It all started when a normal-as-normal-can-be couple walked into the animal room wanting a few goldfish for a tank they had recently set up. No, the tank wasn't cycled or stable, yes, goldfish aren't a great choice for an aquarium, but they wanted some fish today, so some cheap feeder comets may end up getting spared from a piranha-induced death if they survive the new tank syndrome. As I'm catching their fish, they were admiring the saltwater tanks we had set up at the time. The guy asked if it was difficult to set up a saltwater tank, so I gave them my normal 5-minute monologue that I've titled ""How not to fuck up your first marine tank"" (I've kept numerous marine tanks before, plus I am a marine biology major, so I know what I'm talking about here).

Afterward, they decided that a marine tank would be too much work/money for them to deal with now (and they really had no clue how aquariums work anyway), so they paid for their goldfish and left. All is well in the pet store universe.

Or so I thought.

An hour later, I hear a page over the intercom. ""legomaniac89, line 1 please. It's urgent!"" Urgent. Great. I get to the phone expecting a family member on the line with some bad news or something. Nope. It's the guy from earlier, in a total panic. The conversation went something like this:

Me: ""Hi, how can I help you?""

C: ""I bought those goldfish from you earlier, and they're already all dead or dying!""

Me: ""O...k..."" I then ran him through all the normal what'd-you-do-wrong questions, and all seems fine

Me: ""Can you bring in a sample of water for me to test? That way I can see if there's anything in your water that shouldn't be there.""

C: ""Could salt hurt the fish?""

Me: ""At higher levels, yes. Did you add salt to the tank?""

C: ""Well on the way home, my wife and I decided that we wanted to try a saltwater tank, so we stopped at Other Pet Store and bought the biggest carton of aquarium salt they had.""

Me: ""Oh no....""

C: ""I dumped the *entire carton of salt into the tank*, then added the fish. Is that why they're dying?""

Me: ""..............""

C: ""Hello?""

Me: "".............yes....that's why they're dying....""

Not even Jean-Luc Picard has a facepalm as epic as mine at this point in the conversation. I really felt sorry for those goldfish as every cell in their bodies shriveled up and imploded. After that, I'm quite sure that couple has given up on any hope of ever keeping fish again, and we can only hope that they keep their chromosomes to themselves in the future.

JumbootsNZ,32,,70,190gby,,354,"So, I worked for an airline in New Zealand. Basically, my job was to take care of our customers who, for whatever reason, need some assistance. Usually it's old people, people in wheelchairs, unaccompanied minors, or big young families.

This one day in particular, I'd had a really rough day. I'd taken abuse for nearly an hour straight from the most horrible family while trying to help them from the moment they stepped into the airport up until the moment they left the country. I took it all in my stride, because I understood at the end of their month-long holiday with three kids below the age of five, they'd be fairly stressed out and wanting to go home. I tried not to let it show, but what that dad was saying was really getting to me. It was near the end of my 12 hour shift, and I'd had a shitty, shitty day, starting from the moment I arrived at work, at 4:30am.

Anyway, this family finally fucks off out of my country, and I have my last task for the day. There's an old English man just arrived from Australia, and he's so old and decrepit that he'd like me to push his wheelchair and help him collect his bags. No problem. He was the loveliest old man, and we got to talking about his grandkids, who he'd just been visiting in Australia, and how he was now coming to New Zealand to visit his brother, who he'd not seen in years. I really enjoyed his company for the half hour or so it took to get him through customs and immigration, and finally handed him off to his older brother when we came to the Arrivals area. I wished him a nice holiday, and told him to request me by name when it came time for him to go back home to England. I'd walked maybe 40 meters when I felt a hand on my shoulder, and turned around to see the old man's older brother. He took my hand and put $5 in it, and said to me ""Son, I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. My brother just told me that you're the most courteous and lovely young man he's ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I was really worried that he'd have trouble with taking care of his baggage and immigration, but he said that you took care of everything, every single step of the way, without any complaints. I know it's not much, I can't really afford to give you much more, but you have my sincere thanks"".

I took the money without looking at it, and said it was really no problem, I was just doing my job and he was really easy to talk to, the whole thing was honestly not a big deal at all, and said thanks, bye. I started to feel tears well up, and dashed to the nearest bathroom, where I broke down in tears, because of the heartfelt appreciation and love I saw in that man's eyes. I've never been touched like that before. Cruised through the next week without being affected by anything that happened, just because of the happiness that I felt from helping that one old man, and knowing the difference it made to both him and his older brother.",Old man's gratitude makes me break down in tears,424,talesFromRetail
FredFltStn,34,,189,1mr3ti,,354,"I've posted a few fireworks stories before. A comment on another story I posted today reminded me of the story below.

**Other Fireworks Stories**

http://redd.it/1m6kxz

http://redd.it/1mq46m (somewhat pertinent to the story below)

BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven, with industrial rack shelving and more than 300 items in stock. My parents are retired and live out of state, but I'm lucky enough to have them (and the occasional nephew) come to Florida to help me run the business when it's open.

We get shoppers in all the time telling us about the fireworks they got from some guy selling them out of his car or a beat up cargo truck (take that BL). Most of the time, they're not happy about it. Either it was a dud or it didn't do what the guy said it would. Sometimes, they got something illegal (usually commercial, not consumer fireworks) and are looking to get more. Occasionally they're excited about their purchase. We had one of those guys this past 4th of July.

Guy came in looking to buy some fountains and smaller stuff. I showed him what we had and made some recommendations. He excitedly told me that he already had the ""Big Guns"". He had gotten a set of mortars and two finale cakes from a guy selling out of his car earlier that day. He told me that the mortars were the best ones available, and you couldn't purchase them from a store.

ME: That's pretty impressive. I spend a lot of time researching fireworks, and I like to think I carry the best mortars you can buy. We have one set that pretty much blows everything else away.

GUY:  We'll the ones I got are special. You have to be a dealer to get them.

At this point, I'm thinking he got a hold of some commercial mortars. 

ME:  Just be careful. If they're commercial grade, you can't light them with a match or lighter.

I gave him the safety spiel and told him how to check if they were commercial mortars. He thanked me and continued to shop, walking around the store.

Maybe 60 seconds later, he walks up to me, grabs me by my arm, and pulls me over to our mortar section.

GUY:  You can't sell these mortars here! You have to be a dealer to get them!

ME:  Actually, I import those mortars from China, and I'm the only place that sells them in the Southeast.

He runs to his car and carries back the exact same mortar pack. 

GUY:  These aren't the same mortars! I paid $200 for them, and the guy told me you couldn't get them in a store.

I showed him the item identification numbers on the bottom of the box. Exact match. They had to have come from my store.

ME:  Congratulations. Those are in fact the best mortars I've ever seen. We sell them for $80 a box.

The guy literally **RUNS** out of my store cursing and carrying his mortars. Left his shopping basked full of fountains and small stuff behind. Guessing he went looking for his ""salesman"". Didn't see him again.",You can't believe everything a guy says if he's selling you something out of his trunk.,543,talesFromRetail
SaintBernards,39,,66,1ktm5r,,350,"This tale happened about 5 years ago, while I was working at a mega retailer. We had 15 lanes along with some self checkouts, but, as always, there were only ever like 4 open.

Luckily I was a very well liked employee at this place and even though I was a cashier, I would always get scheduled as a greeter or self checkout attendant, and then just jump on and open a register if I needed to.

This particular day was very close to Christmas and we had a few cashiers call in sick. Which meant we only had a few lanes open and all of them were backed up.

When I showed up for my shift I didn't receive a till. The service desk and managers were all swamped with typical holiday business, so I had to jump on a register with no money in my drawer. Which wasn't a big deal to me, I just quickly wrote some signs reading ""CREDIT/DEBIT/CHECK ONLY"", taped them up, clicked on my light, and stayed about 8 customers deep my whole shift.

I was telling every single person, before I rang up any of their items, that I could not take cash in my lane, sorry for the inconvenience. The managers and supervisors forgot I needed a till, but I was way too busy to go remind them. All was going well until a woman with a full cart got to the front of my line.

**Me**: ""Hello, just to let you know I can only---""

**Angry Lady**: ""Yea, yea, I saw the sign, I've been waiting forever, just ring me up!!!""

**Me**: ""Ok...""

**Me**: ""Your total is $[like 300]""

**AL**: *Hands me 4 hundred dollar bills*

**Me**: ""Oh, I'm sorry, I can't take cash at my register today, hang on I have to get a manager over here to give me change.""

**AL**: ""Well, you should have told me!!!""

**Me**: ""I... I thought you... knew?..."" *calls for manager*

I checked with the cashiers around me to see if they could give me exact change, but none of them could or they were too busy to check for exact change for $300+. After about 5 minutes, a manager comes over, and I explain the problem to her.

She tell AL she will go and get change, but it will be a few minutes.

**AL**: ""I've been here long enough already! Why would she even be open if she can't take cash?!? She didn't tell me and there were no signs and now I'm late because of you and this stupid store!""

**Manager**: ""She didn't tell you?""

**AL**: ""No, and now I'm stuck here waiting!""

The manager apologizes and goes to get the change. In the meantime I turn my light to flashing and tell the other customers in line that it may be just a minute, but the jewelry counter just behind you can ring you up, etc.

The manager returns and sends the customer away with her change and asks me to finish up and come and see her, so I do.

**Manager**: ""You need to tell someone if you don't have a till!""

**Me**: ""I told all of the service desk, they had me run without one until they could get to me, I told every customer I couldn't take cash.""

**Manager**: ""No, you didn't tell her, she said you didn't.""

**Me**: ""She said she knew and saw the signs.""

**Manager**: ""Then why would she tell me she didn't! You don't make any sense! I should give you a write-up for today, but its too busy, so I won't!""

**TL;DR** Woman goes through my lane, notices (or claims to notice) that I can't take cash, tries to pay with cash, bitches.

**EDIT** Some nice karma for everyone... That manager got fired (for something else) not long after that incident. I got promoted to a supervisor, and left about a year later.

**EDIT 2** No one liked this manager, I have no idea how she got hired or lasted more than a week. Here is a short list of all the things she told me while working there...

1. Every half hour I need to wipe my whole register station down, top to bottom. Like clockwork, as in, welp its 10:30, sorry, I have to stop ringing your order up to wipe down my station. No one ever did this.

2. If we had no customers, we were supposed to wander around and look for a customer who might need help, while staying within sight of our register. But if someone was looking for a specific item, we were supposed to walk them there. Like, leave the register unattended to show someone exactly where something is, not just describe it. And you couldn't turn off your light, because according to her you would just be gone a few seconds.

3. You couldn't have bottled water at your register. She once forced a pregnant girl to throw hers away. That got escalated to corporate and she was forced to allow bottled water, only. No soda, etc.

4. You couldn't chew gum. If she even thought you were chewing gum she'd send you home. 

5. If the customer claimed they saw a sale sign and she overheard, the world pretty much came to a stop. She once had everyone in the kids department look for a sale on a dress, originally $20 that the customer claimed to be $10. No sign could be found, so she found a sale sign FOR PANTS IN A DIFFERENT AREA, on sale for $9, and said the signage wasn't clear, so we had to give the sale to the customer.

6. She once let someone return an opened and very very well used coffeemaker because she felt we should stand behind our products. It was so old we didn't even carry anything close to it anymore. No receipt either!","I don't have change, ma'am...",416,talesFromRetail

This story contains no snobbery, comeuppance of a horrible customer, antics of a mentally deficient co-worker, exploitation by a horrid boss, ridiculous store policies, or any of the other usual fair of my or the rest of TFR's stories.  It contains a single, earth-shattering Kaboom.

Like many other gas stations, ours included a propane refilling station.  Ours was located off to the side of the parking lot, kind of in between the pumps and the car wash.  We were all trained on how to use it, not terribly hard but something that needs to be done correctly to keep from getting sprayed with liquid propane.  It was also one of the very few ways we could get commission, $0.25 per tank filled.  Doesn't sound like much, but during a nice weekend you could easily get $8-10 worth.

On this particular day, I was outside playing dispensary technician instead of inside being in charge.  Meh, sometimes that happens, and it was nice to get outside and run around a bit.  A lady pulls up next to the propane refill, gets out her tank, and looks at us expectantly.  One of the other guys calls out to her that he'd be with her in just a sec, so I forget about it and continue with doing what I'm supposed to be doing, pouring dead dinosaurs into metal containers.  So I don't see my guy run over and start the process.  I can only assume he did things the way he's supposed to, because what transpires wasn't his fault.

The next thing I know, I'm hearing a horrifically loud **KA-BLAM** from the propane station.  I jumped, the guy in the car I was filling up jumped, pretty sure everyone for a 1/2 mile radius jumped.  The sound was like a big-bore rifle going off right next to you.  I actually felt it in my stomach.  I whipped around to see a rapidly dissipating white cloud, and my co-worker and the customer laying on the ground.  Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh man, Oh God.  [Oh man Oh God.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg)

I rushed over, fearing that I was about to see dead or dying people.  Instead, my co-worker is trying to sit up, with a trickle of blood coming out of his ear.  I gently place my hand on his chest and tell him to lay back down, don't move.  He can't hear me, but at least gets the idea and doesn't try to get back up.  I check on the lady customer, and she's in a similar state, unable to hear but seemingly fine from what I can see.  Regardless, I pull out my phone and call 911.  I told them we just had a propane tank rupture, and there are two people with possible injuries.  Given how many firetrucks arrived, I probably should have told them it was a 5-gallon tank, not the 500-gallon monster.

As it was, FIRETRUCKS, FIRETRUCKS EVERYWHERE.  Several ambulances, too.  The station is closed down, and the two who were next to the tank get the once over by medics.  Actually they got a twice over, but given what had just happened, and the minor miracle that neither of them had been struck by anything other than the ground, it made sense to check and re-check.  During this time the general manager, the assistant manager who lived near by and was off for the day, and the owner had all been called and told to come down.  We didn't know yet what had happened, and wanted to make sure they were on scene in case legal stuff came up.

After the initial chaos died down to something more akin to Black Friday in the late evening, the fire investigator showed us what happened.  He picked up the end of the hose from the refill station and there, still screwed onto the end, was the valve from the 5-gallon tank, along with a chunk about the size of a coaster from the tank itself.  Wow.  The investigator said that apparently the weld had failed, though how or why, he couldn't say right then.

However, one question remained.  Where was the tank?  It had gone between, vanished, pulled a Jimmy Hoffa, demonstrated it's ninja capabilities, been taken by the Lord in the propane tank rapture (The Rupture?).  It couldn't be found anywhere near by.  We were pretty certain that it hadn't disintegrated, because we would have found shrapnel and such.  It was just...gone.  Weird.

Both my co-worker and the customer were taken to the hospital for evaluation, and to get their eardrums fixed.  A couple hours after all this nonsense occurred, and we were back to semi-normal, albeit shaken up.  I've seen those little green backpacking propane tanks get ruptured by idiots with guns before, but never experienced a big tank going off.  That's a new one.

Fast forward about a week.  One of the other co-workers who was in attendance to this event lived near by, and walked to work.  He walked through the door with a ""look what I found!"" expression on his face, carrying a propane tank with a big hole in the top.  Damn dude, where did you find that?  Apparently when the top blew off, it had kicked the tank across our parking lot, over a street, through the parking lot of the McDonalds adjacent to us, over a fence, and into a drainage ditch about 75 yards away.  He'd found it when he was walking to work, dropped his phone into the ditch while trying to mess with music, and had gone after it.

I wish I'd had the wherewithal to take a picture of the hole, because it was pretty impressive.  The edges all bent outward, and looked pretty ragged.  While the tank looked pretty new, there were several dents that I assumed were from the tank banging into things as it made it's first and unsuccessful attempt at space travel.  We gave the tank to the GM, and I think she ended up taking it home as a souvenir.

diinomunster,90,,141,1pb94v,,346,"So I work graveyard (10p-8a) at a gas station. This morning around 2:15 I had a guy in his early twenties come in. Our site is really slow so there's no point in having more than just me on, most of my business is people paying for their gas at the pump with their card. 

I greet him when he comes in like I do everyone and he walks right over to my register. I figure he was a bar fly looking for his smokes and ask how I can help him. 

Bad Guy: you can hand me all the money in your till and in your safe. 

I just sort of sighed at him. 

Me: listen buddy. You're not only on multiple cameras (I gesture to the big TV that shows all my camera views), but there's also a cop that circles this area constantly. I have about fifty bucks in this till and I'm not a manager so I can't get in the safe (not true I have to count it down every night but he didn't know that). I'm also going to warn you now that I have 16 years of martial arts experience with three different black belts and I will use force after which I'll push this panic button around my neck which will lock you in until the SWAT team arrives laughs at you for getting bested by a five foot two girl. OR you could turn and walk out my door and not come back and I won't say a damn thing to anyone about this. 

He didn't even take a second to think, he turned on his heel and walked out. I don't know why he wanted the money, but I'm glad he decided not to go through with it. I'm quite proud of myself for handling that so well. I know we're trained to just give them what they want and hit the panic button when they leave but I think if you calmly and rationally lay the facts out for people it'll turn them off to the idea. 

Anybody else have crazy robbery stories?

Added edit: okay, because I'm tired of repeating this haha. 

If the guy had been intimidating at all! If I had felt any that at all! I would have just given him the money. But he was a scrawny mirror half drunk guy, who I'm pretty sure I've seen around, and who just wanted more money for the bar. No big deal I just had to make him think about what he was doing.

sellyourdreams,154,,108,1f9j17,,352,"I've posted on here once before, but after reading through a lot of these posts the past few days I was reminded of one of my worse times in retail.

Let me just preface this story by saying I am white, and I am also a bit of a germaphobe.  But who among us isn't? All of us who had to work registers day in and day out know that there is no way to know where your customers hands have been, and you are constantly touching their dirty (sometimes sweaty) money, sometimes you touch their hands as well when handing it off.  

This story starts out as your basic day, I am working at a different store in my district to help out when someone called in sick.  And like any other day, I am helping customers and working on one of the registers checking people out.  My policy has always been that whenever people hand me cash to pay for things, when i hand it back I try to drop the money in their hands from a short distance, so I don't come in contact with them.  It sounds terrible, but like I said, I don't like to touch ANYBODY I don't know.

So then comes in this guy, an African American gentleman with his whole family, they come up to pay and hand me their money, and I hand them back their change in the same manner I always do, by lightly dropping it in their hands as to avoid any sort of germ to germ transfer.  Then this guys just looks at me, grabs my arm and pulls me towards him over the counter, and rubs his arm all over mine.  All this while saying ""It's not gonna rub off, honey.""

All I could say is wow.  I could not believe what had just happened.  The man and his family left the store and I just turned to my co-worker, mouth wide open, flabbergasted.  For one I could not believe that someone would do that.  And for two this man basically called me racist, so racist that I would even refuse to touch someone with a different skin color than mine.  I was hurt and I was confused.  After that I tried not to work that store again, just to try to avoid this man who had assumed I was this terrible hateful racist.

legomaniac89,11,,60,1e3tz6,,352,"Hey TFR, here's a quick one from today, No tales from the pet store today, this time I was on my lunch break at a burger/ice cream place near the store.


There was one lady ahead of me in line. She finished her order, I placed my order, and I moved away from the counter to wait for my food. All she had ordered was a cheeseburger, so her order was up pretty quickly. She takes her food and goes to sit down...for all of 10 seconds. She then comes stomping up to the counter, and slams her burger down on the counter, fuming and red in the face. The exchange went like this:


Crazy Lady: I told you people no mustard on my cheeseburger! There's mustard on this cheeseburger! I want my money back!


Employee: I'm sorry, I can make you a new burger if you want.


CL: NO! (She's screaming at this point). I want my money back!


She then rips off the top bun of the burger and shoves a finger toward it, to prove her point.


CL: See! Mustard! I said no mustard!


E: Ma'am, there is no mustard on that burger


CL: Then what's that yellow stuff all over it then?!


E: ...that's the cheese, ma'am...


The psycho lady suddenly went pale, and stood there as the stark realization of her idiocy hit her over the head like a Mack truck hitting a squirrel at 70mph. She stammered for a few seconds, then grabbed her mustard-free burger and dipped out of the store.

justined0414,41,,52,1b45bk,,353,"Some of you have seen my crazy customer stories before, but this one I blocked out of my mind for years and it has recently resurfaced because of an incident that happened to me recently.

I worked for a bookstore for a few years as one of the managers and had come across my share of bat-shit insane customers, but this one was just so crazy I had to laugh at her. It was a nice sunny day when I'm standing at the information desk, organizing books to go back on the shelves when a lady stormed up to me and practically threw a piece of paper at me and just started yelling ""I want my money back, you idiots!"" Seeing that she was just going to be the most polite person I've ever helped I asked her what was wrong in my nicest, friendliest voice. 

She picked up the paper that she had thrown at me that was laying on the counter and told me to read it. I looked at it and it was a bank statement with things blacked out all over the place with one thing highlighted. Now I want to mention that names of places were her card was used were blacked out with a marker but the amounts, her full address and checking account number were not blacked out. I looked at the highlighted line and the following conversation followed:

**Her:** This was a fraudulent charge! My son came in and used my card to charge that and I want my money back!

**Me:** Okay, so your son came in and purchased the items? Does he still have them?

**Her:** Yes, of course he does! I found them all in his room!

**Me:** Okay, well just bring the items back and we can do a refund.

**Her:** No, they were purchased without my consent, so he gets to keep them and I get my money back.

**Me:** Uh, wat? No, that's not how it works. You can bring the items back and return them and get the money back, or you can take it up with your credit card company.

**Her:** Good! That's what I was going to do in the first place but I thought I could come here and try and reason with you since your staff has always seemed intelligent, I guess I was mistaken!

**Me:** Okay, well before you leave, I just wanted to let you know that we have a camera there (pointing above me at the pillar where you can clearly see a camera) and if you do submit this to your credit card company as fraud, we have you on camera admitting that your son bought them, you have knowledge of that and you are refusing to return them. The credit card company will most likely find your claim to be fraud and enforce severe penalties upon you. 

She then turns her big ass around and scoffs as she storms out of the store. She came in several times after that and wouldn't you know that we never got a letter from the credit card company saying that she was disputing the charge. The best part is, that our camera is one of those two second delay cameras without sound. So you could see her talking to me, but couldn't hear what she was saying and you only saw every other second.

So. I work for an electronics company that also offers training on products that we sell; you come in at a scheduled time, sit down with a trainer and they'll either teach you something from a set curriculum, or will show you specifically what you want to learn.

A few years ago, we ran a promotion over Christmas to attempt to increase the number of people that took advantage of this training program. In order to attempt to do this, if you bought a particular product, we would offer one free training session kind of like a taster. The conditions were you would either need to sign up for it during the actual purchase, or thirty days immediately after said purchase.

The stage is set. Enter the players:

Me: 'Hi, what can I do for you?'  
Customer: 'Hi! I purchased a device last week for my daughter as a Christmas present, and I just found out I can sign her up for a free training session on how to use it.'  
M: 'Absolutely! I'll just need to take some information.'  

I get the recipient's name and other information.

M: 'Great. The last thing I need is her email address, so she can use it to set up her session'  
C: 'recipient@someemail.com'  
M: 'All right, she's good to go. She'll receive an email in a few minutes explaining how to get started.'  
C: 'Wait. What do you mean she'll get an email?'  
M: 'She'll receive an email from us explaining how to set up the session.'  
C: 'NOOO! This was a surprise Christmas present! You have to stop the email from being sent!'  

I know that it is impossible, because after I submitted it, it goes straight out, but being fairly new, I ran to the back and spoke to a Manager that confirmed it. I went back out with the worst sinking stomach feeling I've ever had.

M: 'I am so sorry, but it has already been sent out.'  
C: 'I can't believe this. YOU JUST RUINED CHRISTMAS!'  

She turned around and left, leaving a line of customers staring at me. Over the next few days, I kept replaying it over in my head, convincing myself it was her own fault for not telling me it was a surprise. Even though that is true, I should have been smarter, and assumed or at least asked. Either way, it was one of my worst moments.",How I ruined Christmas,435,talesFromRetail

Gratestprsnalive,65,,64,10wz4u,,350,"We’ve all had that one employee when working who just didn’t quite fit. The store I work in has a great atmosphere. Awesome bosses, great employees, it’s not a bad gig for someone in college to work easy hours at a relaxed pace. For the most part, all employees are really laid back. We work in an affluent area, and are surrounded by other large chain stores. Nearly everyone in the store kind of has the same personality and outlook, it makes for great fun , nearly everyone… except bob.

Who’s bob?

Think the twenty-something suburban thug. He’s never gotten out of the pocket of mommy and daddy, but lives his life like a hardened criminal. He’s never (to anyone in the store’s knowledge) committed any serious crimes, and the store doesn’t hire felons. So, he’s become something of a running joke for the store. Bob is a little slow, no matter where he works there will be complaints. Generally he’s just asked to do “back-up” work. This way he doesn’t get in the way, and he can’t possibly mess anything up. But despite being off put, and weird, Bob has never done anything majorly wrong… until recently.

There are three registers in the store. There are of course, no cameras in the entire establishment. Maybe that’s just the policy of corporate, maybe it’s because they’re too lazy to update our already inferior equipment, who knows? Bob has just finished working one of the tills in the front, and is told to take a lunch break. Our lunch breaks are thirty minutes, so it was a little strange when Bob came back almost 45 minutes after he left for lunch. Maybe he just lost track of time? 

Another two hours pass and the store closes. It’s this time, that the manager notices a major discrepancy.  Somehow the till in the back (which receives the least amount of business) is six thousand dollars short. No one can explain why this is. Of course, we can’t leave until the matter is sorted, so corporate is called, and the police as well. Everyone who has worked this day has to remain in the building.

Some of us are beyond suspicion. I generally work front register, and have no access to the back register, though even with that, I’m still asked the routine questions. Eventually we’re asked to go home for the evening, and the police and managers help sort out the problem. There’s never any more than a few hundred dollars in any register, so the store couldn’t have been robbed. When going through the logs of the registers it is possible to see who was signed on, and what transactions they made. The manager’s finally see Bob’s name come up, and he had rang out six-thousand dollars in gift cards. Best buy, wal-mart, game stop, anything you could think of with electronics. He was of course, arrested, and while we might not have camera’s, the other stores were kind enough to lend the police their footage of Bob lumbering around the store. He had spent all of the money in 45 minutes. I’m not even sure I could if I was told to. 

Just another exciting day in retail.

Along with the work we do at the shop, we also provide 24/7 roadside assistance, with the fees varying on range, service type, etc. 

One day we get a call from a guy who needs a tire repair (on a semi) over on highway 101 in San Jose, Ca. Tell him the price is $30 for a tire repair, plus the road service fee ($75), he says okay so we send my uncle out to do the job. 

My uncle shows up, does his job, all goes well with the repair. 
Uncle:Ok, so $30 + $75, that will be $105. Cash or Credit?

Uncle: Well, I do not work for them, and we told you the price over the phone so...yeah, you have to pay

CF: No, fuck that, call your manager you can't be charging that much, you're thieves.

Uncle:sir just pay the bill....

CF: NO! I AM CALLING YOUR BOSS, THIS IS NOT GO!

CF actually calls the shop, my Dad (the owner) answers, and is told by CF that he will not pay, my Dad tells him that if he does not pay, he will tell my uncle to take the tire off the truck and just leave him there stranded, then he can call someone else. CF hangs up.

CF: (yelling at uncle) THIS IS ILLEGAL, I AM CALLING THE POLICE!

this motherfucker actually calls the cops, on my uncle...because he did not want to pay my uncle for the service. Cops show up, hear the story, tell CF to pay the fuck up or they will arrest him. Not sure what happened after that because once my uncle got paid he just took off.

""You didn't guard my spot! Why aren't you doing your job?""

I turned around and politely informed her that I didn't work for the gas station.

""Well, you should have done it anyways! That was *very* rude!""

I simply responded with ""oooookayyy..."" and paid for my stuff, and left.

Background: I used to work in a cash advance booth in a casino. 

Was just another normal night in the casino, processing people's credit cards and checks to withdraw cash. Either way, I had this one young guy come up to my window to get cash off his card. I start the process, swipe his card and start putting his information in the system. 

Him: ""You have really nice hands"" 

Now I've gotten this compliment before, usually people telling me I have the hands to play piano since I have long, thin fingers. So I didn't think anything when he said it. I just replied with my usual ""Thanks"". 

Him: ""You're really cute by the way"" 
""Umm... Thanks?"" Now it was starting to get a bit uncomfortable. 

""Are you gay?""
""No I'm not, I have a girlfriend.""

""Oh man. I would love to just get in bed and cuddle with you.""

This caught me off guard completely and I didn't know how to respond to it. I just kinda looked at him and said something like ""uuhhhmm...."" 

Him: ""Was that a little too much?"" 
""Yeah, just a bit""

So I continue finishing up the transaction. 

""Can I ask you a personal question?""

After that last comment, I couldn't think of anything worse he could say. ""Sure, I guess"". Big mistake. 

Him: ""So..... How big is it?"" he smiles and looks downwards at my crotch. 

I was completely dumbfounded. ""Sorry, I can't tell you that"" 

""Cmon, just tell me. How big is it?""
""No sorry, I'm not gonna answer that.""
""Cmon, please.""
""I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate me answering that""

killerq13,28,,70,1imbk2,,344,"I have posted here before and had no complaints about my job, even though it is not exactly retail. I work at a horse racing track in the northwest.Usually in doing normal vending or commissary tasks, but this particular day I was helping people move their art to their cars from the art show. Fine, no big deal.

What did bother me was one particular customer who was an absolute bitch about how we helped her load her two, $10,000, very heavy sculptures. We got a call at 6:45, and grabbed our flatbeds and made our way up to the second floor and started looking for a lady standing next to a sculpture. 

We find her easily, as she was the only one in the exhibit and politely explained to her that were going to take the sculpture down the employee elevator, off the loading ramp, then walk it around to up front, where she's parked. She then tried to explain to us how it was our job to carry it across the busy second floor and carry it down the escalator, across the pavilion, and then put it in her car. Now this is a sculpture that's two piece put together that I would estimate weighed about 300 pounds each. That may have been doable if the entire second floor was empty, but not with all the people. I caught my friends eye, and knew he had the exact same thought process as me. We were absolutely not doing that, especially not alone. I then tried to explain to her that it simply would not be safe for the art, us, and the other customers to do it her way. She got all huffy-puffy with us at that point. ""Why didn't they send 2 grown men to do this!"" This line made me extremely, extremely angry for some reason. Nevertheless, I kept my happy customer service voice on, trying to explain how our way was much, much easier and safer, and that we would be more than capable of doing it in one trip our way. She wouldn't have it. 

She blew a gasket. ""I STILL DON'T GET WHY YOU TWO LITTLE BOYS WONT JUST DO IT MY WAY! THE CUSTOMER SHOULD ALWAYS COME FIRST, ESPECIALLY WHEN I SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY! LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!"" At this point, I pulled out my radio (walkie-talkie whatever you wanna call it). We'll call my manager Danny for these purposes.
 ""killerq13 to Danny""
""This is Danny""
""Ya, this lady is screaming at us because we won't carry the two parts of the sculpture down the main stairs and the escalator. She's demanding you at the moment.""
""Put her on.""

""What seems to be the problem ma'am?""


He then said exactly what I had said about the safety and she seemed to calm down and accept it wasn't our fault. While she was talking to us again, my manager came up and everything got sorted out. We ended up going down the employee elevator, down the loading ramp, and around to the front, with both pieces being taken at the same time. Perfect. Then we load the pieces into her SUV TO HER EXACT SPECIFICATIONS, had her sign out the art, and prayed she never came back. We went back inside and clocked out, talking about what a bitch she was. We walk around the corner, and what do we see? The same lady, screaming at the front desk people, then turning to scream at us when she saw us. Turned out, the sculpture had broken when she went over our speed bump at 25 and she wanted us to refund her 10,000 for that sculpture. Tough shit lady, you signed it out, were no longer responsible. This felt so right after she made a huge fuss out of nothing but a reluctantness to follow her stupid idea.

For anyone who didn't read the original story Fluffy and Oh Hell No are named so for the Gabriel Iglasias levels of fatness.


Oh Hell no also smells and sweats profusely. Fluffy is just a happy go lucky guy.


Oh Hell No and Fluffy came in today and ask for a Manager. It's me and the newbie part-timer (Kareena) from the first 
story so, once again, I'm up to the plate.


Oh Hell No clearly doesn't like me and goes to sit on our courtesy bench and leaves Fluffy to do the talking.


We have a shoe sale occurring where if you buy 2 you get the lesser valued shoe half priced. Fluffy and Oh Hell No bought 2 pairs of shoes during the sale but weren't given the sale price. Fluffy, politely, wants to know why.


I look at the receipts and instantly see the issue. They didn't purchase them on the same ticket. To get the sale price they have to be rung out on the same translation, even if you do split payment. 


Kareena rang them up and she confirms that they cued at the register singularly and she didn't know they were together.


In her defense there are 9 MASSIVE 5 foot tall banners advertising and explaining the sale that we're having. It isn't unreasonable for Kareena to have assumed they were aware of the sale and still only wanted 1 pair of shoes each since they didn't explicitly state they were together.


Fluffy understand when I explain what happened, agrees that they did manage to miss the 9 giant signs but I like Fluffy, he is polite, friendly and not a douchebag plus, at the end of the day, he and his brother did buy 2 pairs of shoes during our buy 1 get one half sale.


I go to speak to my boss, ask if I can offer Fluffy a price adjustment (something we never, ever do) in store credit and figure I'll take the stern talking to because it seems worth it to keep the customer happy.


Fluffy is pleased with the compromise, was going to buy some shoes for his Mum and Aunt anyway to take advantage of the sale. We sell high end nurses shoes, even with the store credit and sale price he'll be dropping another $100 - 150 in the store today.


Oh Hell No who had been keeping out of it, now, rudely, demands to speak to my boss.



I'm going to be pissed as Hell if I get yelled at for going out of my way to help Fluffy out because His Incredible Stenchness doesn't think its good enough but, at a dutiful peon, I go and get my Boss.



My Boss hasn't even made it 2 steps out of her office before Oh Hell No starts berating her about the Store Policy I had cited a few days ago when he wanted me to put his shoes on for him.


He doesn't like it and demands that it change, yelling that its discriminatory and, biased against the disabled and threatens to write a letter to his senator.


The more he yells, the redder Oh Hell No gets and the more he sweats and the worse he stinks.


Fluffy looked embarrassed and about to step in but my Boss beat him to the punch.


""The health of the **truely** disabled means far more to me that your baseless threats. My employees are not correctly trained to provide that level of care firstly and secondly"" ..... she pointed at the sweat that was literally dripping down in legs and collecting in his socks ..... ""we do not have the proper facilities to handle **biohazard**, nor do any of the laws of our state require us to be compliant with either of these issues."" 



My Boss then turned on her heel and marched back into her office, slamming the door behind her.


Fluffy, who had been selecting some shoes, started laughing and taunting his brother: ""You got told!"" etc until Oh Hell No waddled his way out of the store.

My dad was on a business trip in a large city about an hour away from were my sister and I live. I had already planned to fly out to visit him and my step-mom as is, so the plan was that I would drive up to the city he was at, stay the night, and we would fly out together in the morning. Now our flights were on different airliners, but we would have arrived only minutes apart from each other. They were morning flights, but nothing too early. To save money it was decided in advance that my sister would drop me off at the hotel, which would also give her a chance to spend time with him and for him to spend time with my niece/his granddaughter.

So I stayed the night at the hotel, got up in the morning and we loaded the luggage into the rental car my dad had and checked out. Before the flight, however, he had some last minute things he had to do at the office. Now it wasn't like he was a work-a-holic or anything - he was the Vice President of a fairly large company and was working on a contract worth tens of millions of dollars. Something came up and they needed my dad at the office right away before he left.

Well, we both ended up missing our flights because of it. No biggie, his company pays for his travel and he could easily absorb the fee associated with transferring my ticket to a new flight.

So we get to the airport, he gets his new ticket from his airliner and we go to my airliner to get my ticket. Turns out the next flight wasn't until around 8 PM, which would have me landing around midnight. I jokingly mention to my dad that my step-mom is going to love coming to pick me up that late. The agent, very matter of factly, said ""Your mom must love you, because if you were my kid I would make you find your own ride because you couldn't plan ahead enough to make your first flight."" He then turns to my dad and continues ""And I sure as hell wouldn't be paying for my son's mistake either, he would pay for the ticket not me.""

My dad and I turned and looked at each other before I looked back at the agent, who was frowning at me. I replied ""I hope you realize that my dad caused me to miss the flight because he was my ride, and that he missed his flight as well, and that I am not some kid either - I'm 27 and this is a vacation that I'm already paying for"".

The agent didn't say anything - he just went ""hmph"" and looked down, clacked at the keyboard, printed the ticket, handed it to me and simply said ""Here is your ticket.""

Being a naive 16-year-old and a bit of a pushover, I didn't know that my boss was legitimately crazy. She used to have me polish the cutting chairs with a toothbrush, and wouldn't let clients put their feet on the bar part, lest they dirty it. Sometimes the clients would tip me, especially when I had to assist with things like hair extensions or washes. She would take it from me, saying that she paid me enough to not be tipped. Again, naive 16 year old me didn't know she was nuts. I would often go home crying, but I thought this was how all jobs were. I also didn't want to quit because my dad said I needed to know ""the value of a dollar"". Until this happened. 

**Story**: As I said, I worked every weekday except Wednesday, and then Saturday. Well, one day, crazy boss lady (CBL) pulls me into the back and says she can't afford to have me work on the weekdays anymore and just wants me on Saturday. I was actually relieved, because this gave me an excuse to quit my dad would accept. So, I put in my two weeks' notice, and then went into the color closet, where the hairdye was stored. 

I was pulling down hair color for next clients, and my hands were full of little boxes. I turn around to see CBL standing in front of the door like a creepy ghost, and nearly throw them at her in fright. 

Me: *jumps* Sorry, I didn't see you there! 

CBL: IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO YOUR ELDERS TO QUIT YOUR JOB! YOU ARE DAUGHTER I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE! I HAVE ONLY 2 SONS, NO DAUGHTERS! I RAISE YOU LIKE MY OWN DAUGHTER, SET YOU UP TO TAKE OVER BUSINESS WHEN I'M DONE! YOU VERY DISRESPECTFUL, YOU CANNOT JUST QUIT JOB! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WHEN I WANT TO RETIRE?!?

Me: O_O

The door won't open. ...Why won't the door open?? OMG THE DOOR IS LOCKED, CBL LOCKED ME IN THE CLOSET. 

I proceed to knock/pound on the door for about 5 minutes and then give up -- the closet is in the back of the back room, so even if she wanted to let me out, she probably couldn't hear me. 45 minutes later  (the processing time for client 1) she comes back for the next client's hair color. 

Stepping in the doorframe to block me, she reached for the hair color. I quickly put it on the shelf behind me, shoulder past her, and left, only to return 2 weeks later with 2 friends to get my paycheck.

My dad was fine with me quitting.

Bravesfan417,31,,88,1midzg,,348,"Hello all! As many of you know, I've posted many stories about my dealings with my old boss ""Mike"" the past few days, and today, I thought I would share the most hilarious situation that I walked in on after hearing a commotion in the produce aisle. Enjoy!

It was a Saturday like any other day, except on this particular Saturday, our produce manager was sick. I was pulled off of stocking, and was put in charge of running the produce department for the day. For a little background, I worked at a small store, where Saturday's (like most grocery stores), were always our busiest days (save for pre-holidays), and one of the reasons that our Saturdays were so busy, was because we had a massive amount of Amish come in on that day.

Anyways, I'm in the back, marking down some fruit and vegetables that were starting to look a little on the bad side (Amish would buy them for their pigs), and all of a sudden, I have an amish man burst into the warehouse and over to the side where most of our produce pricing takes place.

Me: Err, excuse me sir, we don't typically allow people in the back, is there anyway that I can help you?

Amish Dude (AD): Yeah, I was wantin' to buy some vegetables that I could feed to my pigs. Y'all normally have some on Saturday, but there's none out there, and I'm in real bad need of some.

Me: I'm actually pricing some up now (we would fill banana boxes with them, and price them by the box), if you'll wait outside of the warehouse doors, then I can bring them out when they're doing being priced.

AD: Thank you very much.

So, I keep pricing boxes of old fruit and vegetables, all of a sudden, I hear some yelling and screaming, so I walk out to where I think I'm hearing it from, which is the produce aisle, and Mike is there harassing the amish guy that I had just told I would bring some fruit out for.

AD: This ad says that these apples are supposed to be on sale today only, and I want it at this price!

Mike: Well, I don't have to sell it at that price, and what are you gonna do? Call corporate? You can't even use a phone! (The amish in my area used the payphone outside of our store if they ever really needed one)

AD: This ad says that it's this price, and I'm buying them for this price! And I'll go outside and use the payphone!

Mike: That payphone is our property and you can't use it if I say you can't!

Me: Err... Actually, that payphone is on the other stores property right next to ours... So, technically, we can't deny use of it to anybody seeing as it's not on our property.

Mike: What are you doing out of the back??? Didn't I tell you to only do produce today?

Me: Looks like I'm in the produce aisle, Mike. And that sale ad applies to all stores. If we don't have an item, that would be the only reason that we don't sell something at that price. While I suppose that you could refuse to sell him those apples at that price today, the next time I see him, I would sell him the apples at that price without telling you.

Mike: And how do you propose to do that after I fire you?

AD: Excuse me... Sorry... But I was wondering... (Takes apple out of bag), if I could throw this apple at your head?

I don't know why, but I just suddenly busted up laughing in the middle of the aisle. Other customers who had come over due to the commotion just started busting up laughing. Mike's face got about as red as the apple and told the man that he needed to leave the store. He tells me to escort the amish guy out, and while displeased about it, I do it.

AD: Hey, my wife is in the buggy, if we don't tell Mike, then he wouldn't recognize my wife. You won't tell him, will you?

Me: Nah, but only on one condition...

AD: Sure! What is it?

A little info here, our amish barn (where all the amish would park) is off to the right-hand side of the building when entering, Mike would park his motorcycle in front of it.

Me: You know the shovel in the amish barn? Well, could you scoop up some horse crap and deposit it in front on that motorcycle there?

This friendly amish guy starts laughing, walks towards the amish barn, grabs a shovel, and just starts bringing out mounds of horse poop and depositing it all around Mike's bike.

I walk in with his wife, throw three bags of apples in her cart with a note (we had limit 2. You had to have a managers note to buy more. Not a manager, but the cashiers all loved me). I grab a box that I had previously marked down to $8.00, grab a sharpie, mark it down to $4.00 with my initials on it. And go about working on produce again.

Mike leaves about 45 minutes later and comes storming back into the store, and calls me over the intercom to come to the front.

Mike: What did you do?????

Me: Errr... I've been working in produce all day... I've been working 5 hours without a break, so I'm going to go take one now.

Mike: No you're not! You're going to go clean up the horse poop from around my motorcycle!

Me: Actually, no. I'm really not. My lunch hour was more than an hour ago, and I haven't been able to take one since you believe everybody should work around your schedule. So instead of a 15, I think I'll go on lunch, good luck with the horse shit.

I go and clock out and walk out to my car to go home for lunch. I look at Mike's motorcycle, and I kid you not, there is at least a five foot radius of horse crap all around his bike. This amish guy must have been out there doing this the whole time that his wife was in the store.

That amish guy would come in to the store at least on a weekly basis and we would shoot the breeze, so next time that he came back. I asked him why he put so much horse poop around the bike.

AD: Well, I started on it, and then (another amish guy's name. Completely forgot the name) pulled up and asked what I was doing. I told him, he went back to the barn, and pulled around that big trash can that y'all have for the horse poop, and grabbed a shovel from his buggy, and we just started dumping it all around the bike. He thought it was the funniest thing ever.

It was one of the best stories that I've ever heard, and that guy and I would talk every time that he would come in to the store. He actually just had a baby roughly 2 months ago, and I got to meet him when I went back home 2 weeks ago.

I've got a little bit more homework to finish up, then off to more classes and to tutor some middle schoolers, then I plan to post at least one more story tonight! Most likely the story will be about my dealings with unruly customers. I have quite a few of those as well!

narelie,86,,63,wrg75,,344,"
Ok, so bear with me, I had to cut out some of the details, to keep within limit.

So our story begins years ago, when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guy's website. $750 total, to cover the design I made, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, we'll call him TJ, threw a fit about the price, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, however, throws a massive fit, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, that evening, the guy who I paid to code, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, in a fit of rage, promptly logs in to TJ's website, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we overcharged him, that we scammed him, now we have to give him the entire design for free, and that if we didn't, we'd suffer. 

I explain, politely, that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversal/non-payment, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coder's buddies, and Coder had enough of TJ's shenanigans. He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJ's industry, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), telling me they're going to be suing me for slander, extortion, etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, he's gonna cut me, he'll find my family....I end up blocking him because I'm not gonna listen to that. After blocking him....radio silence. I thought perhaps, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account. He's apologizing, and asks how I'm doing. I said fine, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, I need to know if you'll make a design for my new site...” and gives me a link. At this point my kid was squirming, so I got up, put her down so she could leave, and went back to see what he was talking about. I click on the link, and immediately, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, and look at TJ's im, where he's laughing and saying how he bets that’s gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget. I'm furious, and block him. At this point, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people, wanting to know quotes, asking me to look at their site and see what I can do...and it'd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn. 

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, with all sorts of insane claims. Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry, and that with every project, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me, I would contact the police. I was done with it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while, a year in fact. 

I later ran into his ex-partner, from the website we did for them. He was furious, asking if I'd heard from TJ. Turns out, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, as he was discussing this with the buyer, he noticed in the site's activity feed, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, new owner discovers a few accounts, all created the day before the sale, with thousands in their balance. 

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep, he'd made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer, slowly over time. He would've ended up making off with something like $27,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages. Upon checking, every single one of them was from a client/friend of mine in the industry, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, he'd closed everything down, and told everyone  they're not being paid. This is something now to the tune of $60k. Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and I meet a new client, and we end up becoming friends. We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people we've dealt with, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, got their money back, and told him to scram.  So TJ tracked down their addresses, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun, and holding their family hostage, threatening to shoot them if they moved.

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars, all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on him.

Second guy wasn't actually home, he was on a trip, but his family WAS, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course, and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had done.

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him, and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lesson....but that “the only one who couldn't have that done to her was that &amp;*@$ narelie”. Because I'd been smart and it was difficult to track down my address.

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out, I'd call the police on him, his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck. 

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying, he traded them for drugs. 

Afterwards, he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs, assault, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, and with the lawsuits looming, he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed. Didn't work, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However, he isn't done yet. He's shown back up recently, attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startup....saying he's changed.

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that, considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month: Child Abduction. (Kid's safe, as far as I can gather)

For a description of myself, I'm 17 (final year of hs), a guy, and I am a cashier at *insert large grocery store here* (I think my age was relevant for this to happen). As I was scaning through items of customers, I started to help a couple. The guy looked maybe early 50s and was with what appeared to be his wife, who looked about the same age.

Eldadelin,28,,53,1h5wi7,,345,"It was long, dark night over at a General Store. I've been working a 15 hour shift because I had to fill in for the three people that called out sick. I was already there and the managers didn't want to call anyone else in, and, since I know all the departments, it was easier just making me stay. The day was going by fine, slow, but fine. I did the truck, processed clothing and other merchandise, and then hit the sales floor to provide customer service/Backup Cashier.

Now... We'll call this lady.. S for short. I have never - never in my life been treated this way, but this.... this was something different.

I was working in men's department. We're 2 minutes from closing (means about 30-45 because people won't leave, a big line ect). S walks up to me.

S: HEY! HEY YOU!   

Me: Yes? 

S: I need this shirt, but I don't like the stripes. You NEED to find me a new one.

Me: Okay, we're closing soo- 

S: I didn't ask.

M: Okay, let me see if I can find one shirt that'll suit you in our H racks.

S: I already looked, get me one from the stockroom, now.

M: Anything specific?

S: I need a red, Long sleeve X3L shirt

M: Sure, give me one moment to check our stockroom

(Sometimes we can do this - not at closing though, but I got the hint of her attitude, and decided to go. Being there in the morning I know what we had, but I was just trying to make her satisfied so nothing bad would happen)

I walk outside, and S is opening the stockroom door (Big nono) trying to get inside. 

Me: I'm looking for the shirt

S: I NEED TO FIND IT YOU'RE TOO SLOW (Screaming)

&gt;Call over radio ""I need a manager to call security in the stockroom please""

S: YOU CANT DO THIS IM THE FUCKING CUSTOMER YOU FUCKING LITTLE SHIT

Security arrives (Keep in mind, it's late and there's nothing else to do, we're next to a cafe place so we actually got the police rather than mall security, it's where on-duty go for break or late dinner)

P: ""Whats the problem, mam?""

S: THIS LITTLE SHIT TOOK AWAY MY SHIRT, TAKE HIM NOW HE'S BEING AN ASSHOLE TO A CUSTOMER.

&gt;Tells the actual story

At this point, S goes bat-shit, knowing she wouldn't get her way. More screaming and cursing, and it's about 10:45 at this point..well after closing. As she starts knocking over shit, police try to handle her down but shes a problem to move...so what did we do...?

Handcuffed her to the flatbed. Rolled her fat ass outside and into the police car. It was one of the most frustrating nights that paid off so well at the end of it all.

Been pretty good otherwise, few more stories but.. another day.

theycallmejeremy,42,,51,1gzp7q,,351,"I worked a lot of retail before the awesome job I'm in now, and reading a lot of these posts took me back to the dark time in my life.  I worked for the biggest new/used specialty video game retailer in the country- that should be enough info for context.  Video game sales are unique- people don't need video games like they need clothing, food and so on- but often they seem like not getting the new Madden or Call of Duty is the end of the world.  Here are some of the most memorable experiences I had.

**Panic Dad!!**

I was working during Christmas season at the busiest store in the district, and one of the top 50 volume stores in the country.  Needless to say, it was busy as hell the entire time.  I normally answered the phone since I could run a register and work the phone better than the other employees in the store.  On December 23, a parent called, and I could hear the panic in his voice.  He obviously had a list that he had neglected, and he was going to be in trouble if he couldn't find everything.  He listed off about twelve different items, and we had 11 of them- and the one we were missing was across the street.  I told him that if he gave us two hours, I could go get the item from the other store and we'd have it ready for him.  This was going to be a $800 sale, so I was willing to do a little extra.  I went to the other store, got the item, rang everything up and suspended the transaction for later, to save time.  A couple hours later, a man walked in, and I could tell by the look in his face that it was Panic Dad.  I called him over to my register, exchanged pleasantries, and had his total ready before he knew it.  He had tears in his eyes- apparently I had saved Christmas.  His total was about $837 after tax.  He handed me 10 $100 dollar bills and told me to keep the change, and asked for our customer service and district manager's numbers, so he could tell them how thankful he was.

**There's a car on top of yours**

Same store, a couple of months later.  I'm the third keyholder (assistant to assistant manager, basically) and I'm working with the assistant store manager.  We're decently busy, but it started raining, so we were slowing down.  All of a sudden, we heard multiple loud crashes outside.  A few customers ran to the door to see what happened- a car had sped through the wet parking lot, hit a median and flipped onto two other cars.  I could see that one was a VW Beetle, and I knew the person who drove it- they worked next door.  I was thankful that it wasn't my car, until one of our regular customers said- ""Hey theycallmejeremy, you drive a white Malibu, right?""... yep, my car was under theirs.  I went outside, and helped the teenagers who were in the car on top of mine get out and get safely down.  After the police came and got everyone's info, I went inside to call a tow truck to get my car, and the kid who was driving actually asked me if we had any Call of Duty 3 in stock...

OK, those were memorable, but not really the horror stories that you may be looking for.  Here we go...

**Hell yes, I'll pay more!**

At this store, we had to try and sell a discount card for used merchandise.  It was $5, and got you 10% off used games for a year.  It was a good deal, especially when items for the XBox 360 and PS3 started at 54.99 used.  A customer came in, and bought a bunch of used games for his Playstation 2.  This conversation took place.

Me- ""Your total is $192.20.  Do you have one of our discount cards?""

Customer- ""No thanks.""

Me- ""It'll actually be free today, and it'll knock more than $10 off your total.""

Customer- ""I said no thanks!""

As I'm ringing him up, another customer goes to our other register, and hands someone his discount card and game, and is told what his total before and after was.

Customer- ""Why does he get his stuff on sale and not me?""

Me- ""He has our discount card, sir.  It's $5 and gives you 10 perc...""

Customer- ""I SAID I DON'T WANT THE FUCKING CARD, JUST GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT!""

I ended up just adding a card to his purchase, saving him $12.  He leaves in a huff.

**MY DAD'S A COP!!!**

We sold both new and used games, and we were pretty good at checking the condition of items coming in.  Return policy was actually pretty good- if you bought a used item.  New items could only be refunded if they were sealed.  Used items could be refunded for whatever reason within 7 days.  That gave customers a chance to test a game to make sure they liked it, and was often the best selling point for used items.

Anyways, a teenaged kid came in with the game Two Worlds the day after it came out, and wanted a refund.  I saw it was opened, and explained our return policy.  He wasn't happy, and complained about how bad the game was.  I told him what the trade in value was, and said that was the best we could do.  He starts screaming- ""You stole my money!  Refund this now- My dad's a cop!""  I started laughing.  After knocking down some of our displays, he left the store.  Two hours later, he comes back with his dad, who is indeed a city police officer, in uniform.  His dad walks up to me, and asks- 

Cop- ""Did you steal sixty dollars from my kid?""

Me- ""No sir, I think he's upset because of the game he purchased.""

Cop- ""He told me he came in and tried trading in a game we bought for him Wednesday, and he left the game and his money on the counter, and you took it and kicked him out""

At this point, I laughed- I couldn't believe he was serious.  The cop wasn't laughing though, so I realized the kid just told a lie to his dad.  I showed the police officer the CCTV footage from earlier in the day, and when he saw his son knocking over displays and walking out of the store with the game in his hand, his dad just hung his head and sighed.  Nothing like video proof that your kid is a world-class brat, huh?

**Slap heard across the world**

The last story I'll go with today is the one I tell people the most.

I was behind the counter after the XBox 360 came out, and we were sold out like everyone else.  We had presold our allotment, and although we had some systems in the back, they were already paid for and just awaiting pickup.  I had just rung up a customer that prepaid, and brought his out from the back.  A guy that was about 5'10'' and 150 lbs (I'm 6'3'' and 300 lbs) walked up to me after I gave the first customer his system, and started going off.

Crazy-""I called yesterday and y'all said you was sold out of 360s!""

Me-""We are sold out- we just have those that were preordered.  We should have more by the end of January.""

Crazy- ""Oh hell no!  If you have it, you have to sell it to me!  You can't be discriminating!""

Note that both me and the customer were white, and other than being a little short and skinny, there was nothing to discriminate.

Me-""Sir, we can only give the systems to people who paid for them already""

Crazy-""Naw, son, now that ain't gonna work for me""

He starts walking towards the back like he's going to barge into our storeroom and grab one.  My employee at the end of the cash wrap starts to put her hands up, and the guy shoves her into a Playstation 1 clearance rack.  Another customer gets between them and tries to help her up, and the crazy guy pushes him away.  At this point, I start walking over and put my hand on his shoulder, and ask him to leave.  He wheels around and gives me a full-on slap in the face.  I look at our store manager, whose chin just hit the floor, and toss my store keys to him- I was pretty sure I was about to get fired.  I told him to call the police, and I grab the guy in a headlock and take him down to the ground until the cops get there.  A few minutes later, his wife and teenaged son come in from their shopping somewhere else, and see me holding him down.  The wife starts screaming and clawing at me, and the son jumps on my back- like I said, I'm a big guy, so I wasn't fazed.  The cops came, and all three of them got to spend some quality family time in jail.",Stories from Video Game Hell...,402,talesFromRetail
Docholliday666,24,,83,1el1gl,,345,"Hey all, just thought I'd post a nice story that wouldn't have happened if not for a retail job.

When I was 23 I was working as a barista, and later a shift supervisor at a large coffee chain that we'll call CosmosMoney.

Anyhoo, my store was a rarity at the time as it was a 24-hour location. 
Being a night-owl I worked the graveyard shift. At the time my girlfriend and I had been together for about 8 years in a toxic relationship. 

Working a graveyard shift I met alot of different people, people that became friends and in some ways, family. I had students studying, and people who just went out and wanted somewhere cool to hang out. I became the smart-ass frappucinno slinger who would goof around, and go outside and have a cigarette with the customers and generally do what I could to make them have a good experience.

So after working there for about a year I had formed strong bonds with quite a few customers. One in particular. She was a sarcastic, smart-ass woman who was also one of the nicest and sweetest people that I had ever met. We talked and joked and generally got along quite well. 

A couple of months later the idiot girlfriend and I got married, much to the chagrin of many people that I knew. 
That ended about 3 months later due to us just starting to hate each other. I honestly have no idea why we decided to get married, maybe we thought that it would help repair some of the issues that we had, but alas, it didn't. 

So after i decided that I was done with it all, I starting hanging out with my customer more and more. She helped me out of a really dark place when the world literally fell down on me with multiple shitty issues hitting me at once.

10 years later I am proud and honored to still be with her, and we have 2 psychotic little boys.

flowerpoints,51,,65,1dxg9u,,344,"Had a funny experience working tonight. A guy comes up to my register with a $20 desk fan. Before I can scan it, he says, ""Wait, I just want to borrow it.""

I am, for obvious reasons, taken aback by this statement. I ask him what he means, and he says, ""I'm going away in 2 days, so I just want to take it for a couple of days and bring it back before I leave. That's cool, right?""

I explain to him that he can buy the fan, but he can only return it if it's unopened. I leave out the detail that he can get a refund if it's broken, because far too many times I tell people that and a few days later have to give refunds on items that were obviously broken intentionally. He then looks at me perplexed and tries to calmly explain to me that ""most grocery stores"" just let you borrow stuff. Trying my best not to laugh, I just explain to him that our store policy states that you have to purchase items to walk out with them.

To his credit he wasn't rude or anything, just a new flavor of stupid. Does anybody know where this guy's logic is coming from? I don't know of anything besides libraries that just lets you borrow stuff...",Apparently this is a library now,409,talesFromRetail
Cyg789,18,,84,1m634t,,347,"I hate queue jumpers with a passion. Sadly, they often get away with it in the UK - people are too polite to tell them off for it.

So Monday I was in a hurry, already in my sports clothes and eager for my evening run. Having to buy a few items at the British supermarket that begins with a T, I figured using the self-checkout would be the quickest option. This store has 4 rows of self-checkout with 8 registers in total, the two rows in the middle form one big barrier with registers on either side. Around a metre behind those stood the only customer who was waiting for a checkout to be free, so I queued up behind him. Shortly after, another two custers queued up behind me.

Enter Mr. T - for Twat with a capital.

He looked at the - short enough - line, decided he wouldn't want to wait and stood himself in front of the aisle with lines 1 and 2. The guy in front of me looked miffed to say the least, but didn't say anything. It was his turn in line 4 now anyway, so Mr. T had to wait, he just wasn't near enough to chime in. I wasn't going to let him get away with what he had planned anyway, so I prepared for speaking up. Mr. T knew exactly what he was doing was wrong, frequently glancing over at our quickly-growing queue with a half apologetic, half ""I don't give a shit anyway, what are you going to do, besides look at me, I'm so charming"" smile. I stared back at him and the registers in front of him with a blank expresiion and thought ""Fuck you."" 

I got lucky. While he was looking at me, a customer in row 2 finished and proceeded to pick up his bags. Did I mention I was wearing sports clothes? I really love my running shoes. While he was glancing over at us, I practically ran towards the now free checkout, passing a dumbfounded Mr. T with a big fat grin. I could hear the guy who had been standing behind me chuckle from at least 4 metres away and when I looked back, most people in that queue were grinning from ear to ear. 

Mr T looked at me, looked at the queue and the grinning people, thoroughly defeated decided he was out of luck for the day, and queued up behind everyone else. The line was now at least 6 people long, so that might have taken him a while. ",Defeating a queue jumper (with his own weapons),431,talesFromRetail

We have all dealt with the coupon customers and I have even provided one story already about my dealings with them, but this one took place at a convenience mart.  

I was nearing the end of my shift and was simply thankful that as the backup cashier that day I had only been called away a handful of times to assist so I was actually ahead of schedule in putting merch away.  Like any good day, it was just waiting to be ruined.  I got paged to come assist at the registers with ~15 minutes left.  The following exchange took place whilst ringing up the 2nd woman in my line, ""Cynthia"".

Me: ""Okay ma'am, your total is $46.27.""

Cynthia: ""Oh, I have these coupons.""

She then proceeds to dig through her clear plastic coupon keeper and pull out a mish-mash of crumpled papers and hand them to me.

Me: ""These are all for your purchase?""

Cynthia: ""The ones I want are in there somewhere.""

Me: ""Ma'am, you'll have to separate them out and figure out which ones you want to use.  If you would like I can hold your purchase, but I have other customers to help.""

Cynthia: ""No, it's your job, you do it.""

{Sigh} Fine, I'm pissed, but whatever.  By the time I'm done with her I'll be going home and I can seethe about it in peace.  I sort through the coupons and find one relating to her purchase.  I scan it through and give her her new total.

Cynthia: ""There are more in there.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I didn't see any more, if you can find it I would be more than happy to use them.""

Cynthia: ""Fine!"" {Under her breath and the part I remember most vividly} ""Fucking useless people."" Then, producing a coupon in a manner that would suggest she was summoning the powers of Grayskull; ""Here, I told you there was another one!""

The coupon is for paper towel. There was no paper towel in her items.  You can now and confusion to my list of emotions.

Me: ""Ma'am, this coupon is for paper towel. Did you mean to grab some? I'm not seeing any here...""

Cynthia: ""No, I didn't."" {Speaking now as one would to a small child} ""This is for &lt;Brand Name&gt;, and I have &lt;Brand Name&gt; in my cart. Get it now?""

Me: {Beginning to lose my patience} ""No, this is for paper towel. See how it says paper towel on it?""

Cynthia: ""It works for all their products, Boredinwisc, {having read my nametag} just run it through.""

Now here's the thing with our system, if it was in our system and we scanned it, but nothing applied, it would reject the coupon.  In the interest of brevity I won't type out the conversation in which I explained that and then (unsuccessfully) ran the coupon.

Me: ""See, as I tried to tell you, it won't work.""

Cynthia: ""You are an idiot! It always works! Just punch it in!""

Me: {Patience now long gone} ""Ma'am, it doesn't *always* work. As you can see, it *isn't* working. I will not punch it in.  Your total is &lt;whatever the hell it was&gt; will that be cash or credit?""

Cynthia: {Now beyond belligerent} ""Screw you! Just punch in the fucking coupon so I can pay and go! This is bullshit!""

Me: {Putting on the over sweet tones that I just *know* gets under everyone's skin} ""Ma'am, I have told you that the coupon doesn't work.  I will not punch it in.  I will however ask you to stop swearing or you will be asked to leave.""

Cynthia: ""You know what you smarmy prick?! I make more in an hour than you make all day! Fuck you and your store!""

Me: ""Than why are you arguing over fifty cents you stupid cow?!""

You know that cliche scene where the wrong people walk into a party and the record scratches and silence follows? Yeah, picture that. I know I just lost my job.

She storms out and I went in back to explain what happened to my manager and punch out.  I got taken off the schedule for the next day and told to cool off.  I know she ended up calling in and demanding my head, but nothing ever came of it.  I don't know if it was my managers being ""cool"" or what the deal was, but I think they may have just been too lazy to want to have to hire and train someone new.

I know this is a bit anti-climactic, so let me spin a new ending for those of you that have stuck with me this far.

Continuing from ""cow"":

Me: ...Further more, get the fuck out of my store!

Cynthia: ""You can't talk to me like that! I want to see your manager!""

Manager: ""You're talking to him. Boredinwisc, watching you deal with this bitch I now know that *you should* be the new store manager.""

Owner: ""I'll do you one better manager, I'm handing over the business to boredinwisc. You're the owner now, kid!""

He then tosses me the keys which I snatch out of the air.

Me: ""Yeah, bitch! Now get the fuck out!""

She runs screaming from the store as confetti drops, customers begin clapping and Foo Fighters emerge from the back for an impromptu performance of ""My Hero"".  I am then lifted up by my co-workers ""Rudy""-style and carried back to my new office.

FranzJosephWannabe,26,,69,1huznz,,341,"So, I thought I'd share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago! Be forewarned, this is a serious wall of text coming.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, you will always have at least a few quirky ""regulars"" who come in to your store. Sometimes it's a good kind of quirky, like ""She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in."" Sometimes, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, but we'll call him Mr. Rogers, because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr. Rogers' evil twin brother) had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about 5 min. before we close. This would happen every time he came. Now, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, get his water tested, ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions (Mr. Rogers: ""Does the Turbo-shock come in a 100 lb. bucket?"" Me: ""No, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, one day, I was at a high-school soccer game, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute, right before they closed, he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs. Mr. Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail. ""After all,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there, but I managed to restrain myself. By the time the 90 minutes were up in the match, I had already formulated the basis of a plan....

The next day I went to my manager, the sweet older lady from my last post, and told her about what I had overheard. She was furious. She wanted to refuse him service, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, at 5 til closing), we made sure to treat him like a king. We gave his water sample every test under the sun. Ph, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Phosphates, Total Dissolved Solids, and many, many more. No test was too obscure for Mr. Rogers. When he asked why we were doing so many tests, we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect. We wanted no stone left unturned! ""But, my water is clear,"" protested Mr. Rogers. ""No, no, we just want it to stay that way! After all, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So, we continued to do tests, all the while his foot was tapping, tapping, tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall. We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately. We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness. We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system. Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine (""But I'm not! It looks great!""). We took him on a mini-tour of some of our newer stock, explaining in excruciating detail how it all works. 

Finally, when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use, he made it very clear that he had had enough. By now it was well past closing time. We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago. He was trapped, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, but then he got it. Someone had let his secret slip. His foot stopped tapping, and the only thing that he could say was ""Oh."" So, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

TL;DR: Guy comes in 5 minutes before closing to get better service. So, we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture.","We just want to give you the best possible service. (Sweet, sweet justice)",410,talesFromRetail

So today a lady comes it. Firstly she insists to buying the display models of the various items she wants, because she doesn't want to put them together herself. This is usually fine, some people are lazy. But then the conversation goes something like this:

Lady: 'Now I want a 10% discount because its floor stock'

Me: 'I'm sorry, I can't give you a discount for that, there is nothing wrong with it'

Lady: 'But its scratched and dirty' (This item had 2 TINY scratches on one corner, and was a bit dusty.

Lady: 'But I want a built one'

Me: 'Then you can have the this one, but I can't give you a discount'

Lady: **Death Stare**

I then ask her if she is a member of our rewards program. She says she isn't, I ask if she wants to join, she says yes. I grab her details and put them in the system. It gives me an error, because she is already IN the system. 

Me: 'It looks like you are already a member, but you haven't activated your account yet'

Lady: 'When did I have to do that?'

Me: 'You should have gotten an email when you signed up'

Lady: 'So I have to set up a password and stuff? I don't want to do that'

Me: 'Yeah, only when you activate do you get your vouchers'

Lady (getting quite angry now): This is bullshit, when I go to store X and Y, they do everything for me, I don't have to set up anything, I'm the customer, YOU should be doing the work for me, I shouldn't be doing the work for you.

Me: 'Sorry, but theres nothing I can do about it. Head Office is in charge of the loyalty program'

Lady: 'But its your job to give them feedback about things like this. I'm the customer, you should value me, rather than make me do work!'

Their reasoning for this is that their baby way getting too hot in the car... the car they were still in. It was a very sunny day and the drive thru had no more shade than the car park, so nothing was solved.

Hello TFR! I have lurked for a while and have decided to post my first story. DISCLAIMER: The location in this story is not ""retail"" per se. It is my local County Fair. However, I still do many things retail employees do like give directions to a certain place and interact with the general public. If anyone knows a better subreddit, please let me know, but due to lack of a TalesFromJuniorLivestock, I shall post here. More info to follow.

A bit of context: I am a Junior Livestock Exhibitor/Officer of the age of 14. This means that I raise an animal to sell at the local county fair. But before the auction, the animals(A pig, in my case) ""live"" at the fair for a week for showing and such. I'll happily provide more info should anyone want any. During the pre-auction week, called ""market week,"" we have to be in the barn for specified shifts that we don't choose(Hey, another Retail similarity) to take care of the animals and to *sigh* interact with the public. Usually this means answering a few questions about ourselves and/or our animals, and we get the semi-frequent question that should really be asked at Information. And then we get the occasional asswipe, like this lady.

Here's the story: I just finished the feeding portion of my duties, and I am walking back to my 4-H group's respective Tack Area with a stack of 10 feed pans. Enter Asswipe(A). A decides that whatever I'm doing is not important and proceeds to tell me this:
**A**: Asswipe **M**: Me **AS**: Asswipe's Son

A: Excuse me, I have a question.   
M: Sure, what is it?   
A: My son wants a pig, are these for sale?   
M: They are, but only at the Auction. *Proceed to find an auction info brochure and explain purchasing information.*   
A: Oh, but he wants one now.   
AS: I want THIS ONE! THIS ONE! *Points furiously at my pig.*   
M: Well, that's my pig but-   
A: Good, then I can buy it now. *Takes $200 out of wallet and flips at me, landing on the feed pans into God knows what.*   
AS: Is that my pig now?   
A: Yep. Go ahead and get in the pen and pet it. (Read: violate EVERY FUCKING SIGN in the barn as well as put your life at risk and worry me immensely.)   
So AS gets into the pen and starts feeding MY pig some piece of crap burrito and then starts hitting it to make it sit up. At this point I'm just thinking ""Oh HELL no. NOT HAPPENING."" Well my pig has finally decided to get pissed off and is attacking the kid. I have to physically pick the kid up and put him outside the pen. All the while, Asswipe has flagged down a member of Barn Crew and is trying to get my pig removed from the fairgrounds immediately as she has ""Purchased"" it and wants it in her car ""By the end of the hour."" Then she notices me picking up her son and this LOVELY conversation ensues:   
A: YOU ASSAULTED MY SON! I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED!   
M: Ma'am, I just saved your son from a trip to the hospital, and this is how you are going to treat me?   
A: Fine, let's just forget I ever tried to buy this pig. AS, we're buying this one instead.   
M(Clearly past the point of no return): Ma'am, you need to get the FUCK out of my barn. NOW. Or you will leave me no choice but to call security.   
A: WELL DO IT THEN! I'LL TELL THEM HOW YOU ASSAULTED ME AND MY SON AND ARE NOT LETTING ME TAKE *MY* PIG HOME!    
By this time, security has taken notice and starts walking over. I tell them that this lady has harassed me, the animals, the barn crew, and that her son has violated state law by getting into the pen and touching my pig. Lady tries to sell her story of me assaulting her and security won't have it. As they are walking out I utter a gem brought to me by this subreddit: ""Thank you, come again!"" When she retorts ""I'll never be back HERE,"" I respond with another gem: ""Please make that a promise."" I kept the $200 she threw at me. Got a nice new iPod. 

And that's my story. Perhaps(If the mods will kindly allow it) I shall do a few more, affectionately named Tales from Junior Livestock, similar to /u/Drunken_Black_Belt's Tales from LP.

pornmoustache,53,,56,1l3pv9,,349,"I work at a fairly large electronics store. No not that one. One of the store's policies is to match internet prices. This is printed basically everywhere. Outside, inside, in the isles, on our name badges, receipts, etc. Now obviously there are some rules when it comes to price matching online and every sign states what the conditions are for price matching. For example: No auction sites, no used items, no refurbished, no cheapelectronicsfromshadywebsitethatlookslikeascam.com. 

Now here comes a gentlemen who needed help with a desk mount. He has an accent so I assume he is foreign. And he also complains about our citys shitty cell phone reception even though it's a huge city with each major carrier getting at least 5 mbps on 4G. Let's call him Foreign cheapskate. Well anyways I help him out with the monitor arm and find him one suitable for his needs. This is how our conversation went about.

Me: I have this desk mount here. It supports up to two monitors at 27"" each.

FC: This is exactly what I need! How much are they.

Me: Currently they are on sale for 139.99

FC: *Scoffs* That doesn't sound like much of a sale for me.

Me: Well it's normally 179.99 so it is a considerable difference in the price. 

FC: Well I'm just going to get this one over here then.

Me: But sir this one does not support two 27"" monitors. There will be no room for them.

FC: No, this will work fine.

He leaves and buys the dual monitor stand for two 22"" monitors. Which obviously will not accommodate his monitors. So guess who I get a visit from later on in the day? Motherfucking cheapskate.

FC: That desk mount you sold me didn't work.

Me: I explained to you that it wouldn't fit and you can't make the arm move to give you more space.

FC: Well I would have gotten the other mount if you would have mentioned that you price match!

Me: We do price match sir, but at that price for the desk mount, it's a bargin.

FC: Well I found it online for 58 dollars.

Me: I really doubt it's the same one. If you can pull it up on my computer I can see if it's eligible.

FC: *looks at me strangely* Isn't that your job?

Me: Well you already know where you're price matching, it would be a whole lot easier if you do it.

FC: *goes and finds the mount on amazon* Look it's right there!

Me: That price is for a used item sir.

FC: So? You match internet prices.

Me: We do, but we cannot match the price of a used item when we are selling it brand new.

FC: If you're not going to match the price then you shouldn't have a fucking giant banner outside your store that says you match internet prices!

Me: They do say that but at the bottom there's a star (I later remembered that it's called an asterisk) at the bottom saying ""*Ask an associate for details""

FC: I don't care what a little star says, if it says you match internet prices, then you match internet prices. This is false advertising. I want to speak to the store manager!

Now at this point, I'm losing my cool. I've gathered about 4 other associates around me just watching this whole debacle going down. Among those 4 associates was my department manager.  Let's call him DM

DM: Well sir, the sign outside clearly says ""see an associate for details"" he is an associate and he is telling you the details of our policy.

FC: I'm sorry, but did I ask for your input?

DM: No you did not but you asked for a manager and I'm the manager of this department.

FC: But you're not the store manager, because you're obviously not qualified for that position.

Now this got my DM rilled up. He doesn't take shit from anyone. He actually was a store manager for another store before but he was getting old, he's around 65, and he just needed some spare income so he came back to work.

DM: Well I wouldn't want to bother him with a customer who obviously is not educated enough to read fine print.

FC just storms off. Screaming ""I'm going to sue you for false advertising!""

He leaves. He actually buys the thing. And while checking out he tells the cashier how everyone in our department was very rude and unhelpful. He even tried to price match it at the registers. He got mad all over again when he was rejected. What a dumbass.

Besides other former jobs I've had (Lan gaming center, *McDougals*, and other various retail stores) I worked in a Petrol station about a mile away from my house for 2 and a half years.

Although there were some douchebuckets who would come in and make life hell, very little that I recall was TFR worthy (Other than the father of a small child throwing a creme egg at our service counter...because...um, he was bored, I guess).

On one particular evening, we had a carpet sales/storage warehouse near our station go up in flames but far enough away not to threaten us, say about 200 yards. It was a fairly small operation, at that. However, we had 3 fire engines, fire chief etc turn up to deal with it as we were in a heavily populated area with plenty of housing.

We had a deli/coffee counter that opened until 6pm, which being an evening supervisor I would normally clean at the start of my shifts (I would work 6-11 4 nights a week while a student). This all went down at about 8pm. Deli was long closed and everything sealed up ready for disposal when I got done tidying our store room.

The firemen and police in attendance sent someone round to inquire if they could get sandwiches and coffees made up, and knowing my boss like I do (He had a brother in the Police service and an in-law in the Fire Brigade, quite possibly on location), I made about 40 sandwiches  out of the days bread I hadn't quite got round to disposing of - still fresh, same day produce, but generally just chucked out. Threw in a few dozen coffees too. No homeless shelters or anything similar to donate to, and put the prices through as store use (free) after leaving my boss a voicemail. So even though we had no deli workers and we had closed the deli, so I jumped on and spent over an hour sorting them all out. I'd not worked the deli in over a year at that point but it's nothing too difficult.

Anyways, to cut a long story short, the next day my boss phoned me at home and told me he was glad I went ahead and sorted them for free instead of charging. Further, he'd had a visit from the local fire chief thanking our store and myself, and they'd left me a 12 pack of beer and an offer of a ride in a fire engine to say thank you for helping them out (Hell, who cares if I was 20. I went for it!).

Made my week, and my boss dropped me a small bonus in my next pay day (I think it was only 10 quid, I wasn't complaining as at the time I generally only earned about 120 a week).

KroipyBill,44,,81,1nfwcl,,346,"Yet another tale when I worked at a large electronics retail store chain. At the time, I was working in our gaming department, so most of my nights involved me cleaning the shelves after stupid kids of whom I'd like to taser, explaining to parents why I don't believe GTA IV (was newish at the time) was good for their 7 year old to play, and explaining to other parents why our ladders to reach overstock product did not fall under the ""kids play place"" category.  

When the night ends and we're ready to close, I'm in most cases *very ready* to close...but I can't if people are sitting at the gaming displays playing Mario Cart, or some other game demo. I have to keep going up to them and say:

""Anything I can help you with?"" 

or 

""You want to buy this game?"" 

But what I was really thinking, was 

""You want to leave before I gorilla glue your hands to your rear?"" 

Gorilla gluing a person's hands to their behind would please me on the most profound level; watching the inconsiderate wipe leave the store looking like they needed to take a royal poo. But despite my fantasizing, they still were playing the game. 

The closing manager on duty that night was a good friend of mine. He was a little irritated at this particular couple playing the games about 15 minutes after we closed the doors as well. We even mentioned to them 5 minutes after we closed that we were closing, but they still stood there. My manager and I stood on the other side of the store looking at them, discussing possibilities. 

**Manager:** Dude, they're both small...what if I were to dress up as that person from scream, run in here, and take them out of the store? 

**Me:** There are a couple problems with that idea. I'm pretty sure you didn't bring that costume to work.

**Manager:** Yeah good point that is definitely our biggest problem with that idea. 

**Me:** You know where the remote is for that TV? 

**Manager:** *Looks around the back room* I think this is it. Same brand anyway so it may work. What are you going to do?

**Me:** Just come with me. 

I hid behind the movie displays so the customer's back was towards me. I then turned off the TV. My manager starts to quietly laugh, but stops when we both can't believe that they TURN THE TV BACK ON!!!

**Me:** Wow...I don't...okay fine. I have plenty of batteries. 

I turn the TV off again. They turn it back on a second time. At this point my manager has to bend over to hide completely behind the displays, as he's losing it hard. He can't stop laughing. I turn the TV off about two more times, until finally the guy says to his girlfriend:

**Guy:** Oh looks like the TV Has a self-turn off timer around when the store closes.

He left after this profound revelation. 

A few things crossed my mind when I heard this. WE TOLD HIM THAT THE STORE CLOSED 15 MINUTES AGO!!!
WHY WOULD THERE BE A TIMER NOW? And secondly, we determined that this tactic was something we were to execute in future days so we could close on time. 

From that point on, the remote remained on the display behind the TV for easy access so other closing employees could bask in such joy of turning a television off. 

**TL;DR: Couple won't stop playing on the game displays after we close. We start turning off the TV's behind them, making the brilliant boyfriend of the couple think it's an automated timer.**
