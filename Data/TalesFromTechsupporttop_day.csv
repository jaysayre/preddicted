Meltingteeth,132,119,1rguyg,570,Background My first IT job involved me doing Tier  support at a University This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues which was pretty awesome Phone troubleshooting sucks However I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally This was no problem I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh airSo about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue No problem someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail The monitor wasnt swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps and the user had a dualmonitor setup I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located I knocked on the door to the targeted office what greets me is a scowling middleaged woman SW for short who practically drags me inside The conversation went something like thisSW Finally Ive been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages It had been ten minutes At this point I notice that her second monitor is also offMe Im not sorry I see that your second monitor is off Is there something wrong with it as wellSW No I dont use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicatedWut But you could have put your work on the other  Screw it Im not here to change her work style I swap out the monitor which does in fact have a faulty port while SW continues to rant Me Well that should do it Customer service reflex Is there anything else I can help you withSW Yes actually cringe My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documentsMe Ok lets take a lookSW proceeds open a PDF file from email The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro the default prints it out the department was using an Inkjet at the time which took an extra minute places it on the scanner and selects the scanners stock program to scan the page into an oddly highresolution JPEG Cringe whiplash This of course takes a few minutesSW See The damn thing takes forever to scan and Im emailed  of these documents every dayMe Well could we possibly lower the quality of Wait that document you just printed from that file and scanned is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documentsSW Yes i have to scan these into an image for our record system and I cant lower the quality because then some of the signatures dont showShe was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner I noted that this program had a big obvious Scan as JPEG function with a few sliders one of which controlled resolutionI then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro She had apparently been doing this open print scan and save process for months I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career pathTLDR Irate recordkeeper finds a wildly inefficient process to keep records Tier  employee saves department hundreds of dollars,Basic Googling or even asking someone else would have saved  man hours,689,TalesFromTechsupport,37872,855

deshe,24,41,1ri4te,173,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I recognized as Elijahs Listen I have a picture You get me A picture And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol Do you understand meHello Are you there I have a picture and IYeah yeah I heared you the first time Elijah Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background I guessedNo you dont understand Listen I have a picture I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures Do you understand me do you want to create a shortcut to that picture an arrow in the darkNo Are you even listening Listen I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandmeWell I will spare you the details but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit  mistake I thought I understood what he wanted  another mistake and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper  the mother of all mistakesAs soon as we were done even though youd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way he went ballistic  I am not making a simile here his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbitWhat the fuck did you do This is not what I wanted Cant you do what you are told All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp Elijah I interrupted I cant help you any further We were on the phone for over half an hour there was actually a call in the queue and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation  much more than this semi capable screwloose  but I had no choice I had to do what I was trained to do delegateElijah this problem is beyond our support limit please contact Microsofts tech support at  anytime tomorrow between  and No Listen I have a pic oh no you dont I am a brick wallThis problem is beyond our support limit please contact Microsofts tech support at  anytime tomorrow between  and But all I want to do is to use the picture toThis problem is beyond our support limit please contact Microsofts tech support at  anytime tomorrow between  and I am going to call again and talk to someone elseThat would be a waste of your time I am the only one here is what I would have said but he already hung up Well what are you going to doFast forward  minutes my phone rings This and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of service no response several seconds of silence a hangupFast forward  minutes my phone rings This and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of service no response several seconds of silence a hangupFast forward  minutes my phone rings This and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of service no response several seconds of silence a hangupFast forward  minutes my phone rings This and that ISP this is John how may I be of service I said without the slightest modification to my tone of voice or registerListen John I have a picture I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp well that was surprisingElijah this problem is beyond our support limit please contact Microsofts tech support at  anytime tomorrow between  and Did I speak to you before he asked a real Sherlock that oneNo I said in my utterly regular voice you must have spoken to desheOh yeah that guy Listen all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming oh my god I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

IsilZha,29,22,1rghh8,96,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have

lawtechie,17,9,1rgd61,68,So Im doing tech support at an advertising agency There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason everybody but I took the same week off Since we were an outside contractor we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage Unfortunately all the competent people were gone They sent me the Walrus The Walrus was some guy who didnt have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer Literally He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheapHe wore tootight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fumanchu mustache which is how he earned the Walrus nickname He mumbled and didnt make that much sense So Im running around like a ferret on meth and Ill take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objectsI soon discover that hes less than useful in a nowhumorous wayThe ad agency uses the top two floors of a  story office building The help desk is on the first floor so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users Most spares are kept in the help desk officesI figure Ill crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation Give the Walrus directions to the artists cube the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I handhold a VPTen minutes later one of the other artists calls meArtist Uhh LawTechie Whats with this guy you sent up hereMe Whats wrongArtist I think you want to come get himI walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie Turns out he didnt know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artists Mac hoping itd work this time The artists sensing weakness started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the WalrusI send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists On my way back one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPSbattery backup I figure the Walrus can handle this I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one So some explanation here Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office all users have battery backups We have maybe ten spares Every few months we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day since battery acid eats through clothing UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with BAD BATTERY in red lettering Theyre put on the shelf with DO NOT USE BAD BATTERIES also in red lettering When we replace the batteries they go on the shelf immediately above  labeled GOOD BATTERIES in red lettering We also remove the tape on the UPS So bad ones are marked good ones are ready to go This protocol just cant get screwed up can itI get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception Perhaps  minutes have passedI walk back to my office not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets The Walrus comes running in redfaced and sweaty WalrusNone of those UPS were any goodMeReally There were three that have new tested batteries I tested them myself Maybe its bad wiringSo we walk up to the cubicle In the trash are two strips of masking tape with half inch block letters in red marker BAD BATTERY So I walk back down take one of the good UPS off of the Good Batteries shelf and install it Beeping stopsI think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks The agency wants to build a little classroom We need to put a  port dumb  ethernet switch under a table run cable to it and make sure it lights up Walrus was saying that hes more familiar with hardware than software or user support so I hand him the drill switch mounting kit and some cables I decide its time to get some food so I leave for  minutes For some reason or no reason at all he ignores the tray like mount kit flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the tableUsing   sheet rock screws So now theres four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table Luckily theyre covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table They havent penetrated the steel bottom of the case I call up the home office and ask them never ever to send the Walrus again,Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport,261,5
Gambatte,30,8,1rg6w8,70,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the

deshe,24,38,1ri4te,178,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I

deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

IsilZha,29,19,1rghh8,97,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

lawtechie,17,6,1rgd61,69,So Im doing tech support at an advertising agency There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason everybody but I took the same week off Since we were an outside contractor we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage Unfortunately all the competent people were gone They sent me the Walrus The Walrus was some guy who didnt have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer Literally He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheapHe wore tootight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fumanchu mustache which is how he earned the Walrus nickname He mumbled and didnt make that much sense So Im running around like a ferret on meth and Ill take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objectsI soon discover that hes less than useful in a nowhumorous wayThe ad agency uses the top two floors of a  story office building The help desk is on the first floor so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users Most spares are kept in the help desk officesI figure Ill crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation Give the Walrus directions to the artists cube the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I handhold a VPTen minutes later one of the other artists calls meArtist Uhh LawTechie Whats with this guy you sent up hereMe Whats wrongArtist I think you want to come get himI walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie Turns out he didnt know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artists Mac hoping itd work this time The artists sensing weakness started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the WalrusI send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists On my way back one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPSbattery backup I figure the Walrus can handle this I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one So some explanation here Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office all users have battery backups We have maybe ten spares Every few months we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day since battery acid eats through clothing UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with BAD BATTERY in red lettering Theyre put on the shelf with DO NOT USE BAD BATTERIES also in red lettering When we replace the batteries they go on the shelf immediately above  labeled GOOD BATTERIES in red lettering We also remove the tape on the UPS So bad ones are marked good ones are ready to go This protocol just cant get screwed up can itI get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception Perhaps  minutes have passedI walk back to my office not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets The Walrus comes running in redfaced and sweaty WalrusNone of those UPS were any goodMeReally There were three that have new tested batteries I tested them myself Maybe its bad wiringSo we walk up to the cubicle In the trash are two strips of masking tape with half inch block letters in red marker BAD BATTERY So I walk back down take one of the good UPS off of the Good Batteries shelf and install it Beeping stopsI think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks The agency wants to build a little classroom We need to put a  port dumb  ethernet switch under a table run cable to it and make sure it lights up Walrus was saying that hes more familiar with hardware than software or user support so I hand him the drill switch mounting kit and some cables I decide its time to get some food so I leave for  minutes For some reason or no reason at all he ignores the tray like mount kit flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the tableUsing   sheet rock screws So now theres four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table Luckily theyre covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table They havent penetrated the steel bottom of the case I call up the home office and ask them never ever to send the Walrus again,Fun with the Walrus,75,TalesFromTechsupport,261,5
Gambatte,30,6,1rg6w8,69,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the
