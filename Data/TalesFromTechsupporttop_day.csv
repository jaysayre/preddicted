Meltingteeth,132,,119,1rguyg,,570,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Space_Lobster,58,,54,1rh0gr,,314,"Hello fellow TFTS friends, I have another user story once again! This time it's a printer story. I get a ticket for a printer, it wouldn't print from anything but tray 1. Usually as we all know, simple fix. So I go all the way to site, adjust the tray settings, starts printing. 

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white. 


**Here is the bonus:**

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

**Onsite** (This user was working for the company for three months already)

Me: What's going on with the printer?

User: The Xerox isn't working 

Me: *approach the Xerox, print test pages*  It seems alright. What's the problem?

User: THE PRINTER OVER THERE! 

Me: **now wanting to kill her** You mean the HP printer? 

User: Xerox, same thing. 

Me: ...(thinking in my head) (...uhhh...no...no it's not) 

User: I can't deal with you right now,  it's bad enough I kept calling the help desk for this problem, and now you're questioning me. I have great communication skills *inserts documents into the ADF, everything comes out blank* SEE! THE XEROX DOESN'T WORK, I LIKE THE OTHER GUY BETTER

Me: *takes the same documents, turns them around, copies and prints fine* You were putting the documents in wrong.

User: Oh.....

highroller038,45,,46,1rh5iy,,252,"I work for a WISP.  Had a customer (Sue) call in on Monday and explained she hasn’t had internet access all weekend.  


Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.


TLDR: monitor came disconnected and said “no signal”… internet must be down.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

I have many more interesting stories to share if ya'll would like.

deshe,24,,41,1ri4te,,173," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is *John*, how may I be of service?"" I said, without the slightest modification to my tone of voice or register.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

drexhex,22,,13,1rgojm,,105,"Said by an administrator when in a meeting about upgrading our underground fiber:

""All this is below ground. What if, in the future, everything is higher up like with this 'cloud' stuff - would we be behind the tech curve?""

I shit you not.","""The Cloud""",118,TalesFromTechsupport
IsilZha,29,,22,1rghh8,,96,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,118,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,9,1rgd61,,68,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,77,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,8,1rg6w8,,70,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,3,1rg7ta,,47,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",50,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,5,1rgly9,,44,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

**Onsite** (This user was working for the company for three months already)

Me: What's going on with the printer?

User: The Xerox isn't working 

Me: *approach the Xerox, print test pages*  It seems alright. What's the problem?

User: THE PRINTER OVER THERE! 

Me: **now wanting to kill her** You mean the HP printer? 

User: Xerox, same thing. 

Me: ...(thinking in my head) (...uhhh...no...no it's not) 

User: I can't deal with you right now,  it's bad enough I kept calling the help desk for this problem, and now you're questioning me. I have great communication skills *inserts documents into the ADF, everything comes out blank* SEE! THE XEROX DOESN'T WORK, I LIKE THE OTHER GUY BETTER

Me: *takes the same documents, turns them around, copies and prints fine* You were putting the documents in wrong.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.


TLDR: monitor came disconnected and said “no signal”… internet must be down.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

I have many more interesting stories to share if ya'll would like.

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)

lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,75,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

I have many more interesting stories to share if ya'll would like.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

drexhex,22,,10,1rgojm,,109,"Said by an administrator when in a meeting about upgrading our underground fiber:

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.

Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?""

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is *John*, how may I be of service?"" I said, without the slightest modification to my tone of voice or register.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

**TL;DR** I once gave tech support to someone who then became a national celebrity",The tale of Elijah,216,TalesFromTechsupport
drexhex,22,,10,1rgojm,,109,"Said by an administrator when in a meeting about upgrading our underground fiber:

""All this is below ground. What if, in the future, everything is higher up like with this 'cloud' stuff - would we be behind the tech curve?""

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.

Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

*seriously? What do you people think I can do about this*

Me: ... I'd start by asking him to move. If he won't and you can't access a different entrance, just make note and return tomorrow, this really isn't a critical issue and doesn't need to be looked at right now.",Why did you call technical support for that?,40,TalesFromTechsupport
Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,21,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago. I notice he is using the ""Unread email"" view, so I switch to his Inbox and show him all his missing e-mails. ""But no! That's not how I read my e-mail, I always use this one"" (Goes back to Unread Email). 
I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders. 
He then ends the intervention with: ""Because I got this problem before and then a friend of mine who is really into computers told me I had to switch to Offline mode to get it fixed but now all my e-mails were gone...""

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

I get a ticket for a printer, it wouldn't print from anything but tray 1. Usually as we all know, simple fix. So I go all the way to site, adjust the tray settings, starts printing. 

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white. 


**Here is the bonus:**

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

**Onsite** (This user was working for the company for three months already)

Me: What's going on with the printer?

User: The Xerox isn't working 

Me: *approach the Xerox, print test pages*  It seems alright. What's the problem?

User: THE PRINTER OVER THERE! 

Me: **now wanting to kill her** You mean the HP printer? 

User: Xerox, same thing. 

Me: ...(thinking in my head) (...uhhh...no...no it's not) 

User: I can't deal with you right now,  it's bad enough I kept calling the help desk for this problem, and now you're questioning me. I have great communication skills *inserts documents into the ADF, everything comes out blank* SEE! THE XEROX DOESN'T WORK, I LIKE THE OTHER GUY BETTER

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is *John*, how may I be of service?"" I said, without the slightest modification to my tone of voice or register.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

drexhex,22,,10,1rgojm,,109,"Said by an administrator when in a meeting about upgrading our underground fiber:

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.

Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.

TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

*seriously? What do you people think I can do about this*

Me: ... I'd start by asking him to move. If he won't and you can't access a different entrance, just make note and return tomorrow, this really isn't a critical issue and doesn't need to be looked at right now.",Why did you call technical support for that?,40,TalesFromTechsupport
Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,21,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago. I notice he is using the ""Unread email"" view, so I switch to his Inbox and show him all his missing e-mails. ""But no! That's not how I read my e-mail, I always use this one"" (Goes back to Unread Email). 
I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders.

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white.

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.

Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.

I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,21,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago. I notice he is using the ""Unread email"" view, so I switch to his Inbox and show him all his missing e-mails. ""But no! That's not how I read my e-mail, I always use this one"" (Goes back to Unread Email). 
I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders. 
He then ends the intervention with: ""Because I got this problem before and then a friend of mine who is really into computers told me I had to switch to Offline mode to get it fixed but now all my e-mails were gone...""

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?!

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,75,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.

TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Space_Lobster,58,,59,1rh0gr,,309,"Hello fellow TFTS friends, I have another user story once again! This time it's a printer story. I get a ticket for a printer, it wouldn't print from anything but tray 1. Usually as we all know, simple fix. So I go all the way to site, adjust the tray settings, starts printing. 

Many hours later edit: The original person that submitted the ticket was not this user. After adjusting the trays I let them know it was done. When I tried to walk away, in comes this particular user that had nothing to do with the case:


User: Where are you going?

Me: Printer is fixed now. (explained about the tray guides)

User: No, it prints incorrectly all the time.

Me: I just printed test pages, it was fine. 

User:NO! It doesn't work right!!!

Me: I can't fix something that is working.

User: *Frustrated* Are you not the tech? Is it not your job to fix it? Let me show you!

Me: Ok... **should have just continued walking**

User: *prints something from her workstation*

Me: Ok?...it looks fine

User: No it's not.

Me: ... *blood boiling*

User: It won't print anything in color! 

Me: That's because this is a laser printer that is only meant to print in black and white. 


**Here is the bonus:**

This user also had a second scenario with printers.

**Onsite** (This user was working for the company for three months already)

Me: What's going on with the printer?

User: The Xerox isn't working 

Me: *approach the Xerox, print test pages*  It seems alright. What's the problem?

User: THE PRINTER OVER THERE! 

Me: **now wanting to kill her** You mean the HP printer? 

User: Xerox, same thing. 

Me: ...(thinking in my head) (...uhhh...no...no it's not) 

User: I can't deal with you right now,  it's bad enough I kept calling the help desk for this problem, and now you're questioning me. I have great communication skills *inserts documents into the ADF, everything comes out blank* SEE! THE XEROX DOESN'T WORK, I LIKE THE OTHER GUY BETTER

Me: *takes the same documents, turns them around, copies and prints fine* You were putting the documents in wrong.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,75,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

Me: “wa…wait….so your screen is totally black and there’s a message on it saying “No signal”?  

Sue: “YES! All weekend it’s been saying that!”


At this point, I knew I wasn’t going to get very far with this lady on the phone.  I had to mute the microphone and bang my head against the desk a few times.  Another tech overheard me and was almost falling out of his chair.


Seems like her internet connection is up and working just fine.  I dispatched a tech out to her house and he discovered that her PC is 13 years old and the VGA cable came lose.  On top of all that, he mentioned the mouse would randomly stop working too.


TLDR: monitor came disconnected and said “no signal”… internet must be down.

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

I have many more interesting stories to share if ya'll would like.

deshe,24,,38,1ri4te,,178," ** All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced **

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.










",Fun with the Walrus,75,TalesFromTechsupport
Gambatte,30,,6,1rg6w8,,69,"In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas, a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud. With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation, the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium; and thus, a star was born. This was, of course, very embarrassing for the cloud, who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of *fusion*.

*Not so long after that,* I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management. Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me, I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platter.

A brand new system was being introduced, and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running. On the plus side, it had already completed acceptance testing, so it should be a matter of plug and play. Oh, naiveté is a wondrous thing! *Should* was most definitely the operative word there.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?""

linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

Meltingteeth,132,,115,1rguyg,,575,"**Background:** My first IT job involved me doing Tier 1 support at a University. This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues, which was pretty awesome. Phone troubleshooting sucks. However, I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally. This was no problem, I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh air.

So about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue. No problem; someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail. The monitor wasn't swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional (albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps) and the user had a dual-monitor setup. I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located. I knocked on the door to the targeted office, what greets me is a scowling middle-aged woman (SW for short) who practically drags me inside. The conversation went something like this:

**SW**: Finally. I've been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages! 

It had been ten minutes. At this point I notice that her second monitor is also off.

**Me**: I'm ^\(not) sorry. I see that your second monitor is off. Is there something wrong with it as well?

**SW**: No, I don't use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicated.

Wut? But you ^could ^^have ^^^put ^^^your ^^^work ^^^on ^^^the ^^^other...  Screw it, I'm not here to change her work style. I swap out the monitor (which does in fact have a faulty port) while SW continues to rant. 

**Me**: Well that should do it. (Customer service reflex) *Is there anything else I can help you with?*

**SW**: Yes, actually. ^*cringe* My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documents.

**Me**: Ok let's take a look.

SW proceeds open a PDF file from email (The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the default), prints it out (the department was using an Inkjet at the time, which took an extra minute), places it on the scanner, and selects the scanner's stock program to scan the page into an oddly high-resolution JPEG. ^*Cringe* ^*whiplash.* This of course takes a few minutes.

**SW**: See? The damn thing takes forever to scan and I'm emailed 30 of these documents every day.

**Me**: Well could we possibly lower the quality of... Wait, that document you just printed from that file and scanned... is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documents?

**SW**: Yes, i have to scan these into an image for our record system, and I can't lower the quality because then some of the signatures don't show!

She was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner. I noted that this program had a big, obvious ""Scan as JPEG"" function with a few sliders, one of which controlled resolution.

I then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro. She had apparently been doing this open, print, scan and save process for months. I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career path.

Me: “alright, just gimme a minute to look up some information here and I’ll take a look”

It’s really difficult for me to focus on the user spewing useless information in my ear while I’m trying my best to find her customer info.  Finally found her antenna’s IP address – tried pinging – I’m getting responses.  Strange, but let’s see what’s going on here.  While I’m doing a little troubleshooting on my end, she proceeds to ramble about all the things that she doesnt have access to due to the service being down


Sue: “I haven’t received any email!  I can’t get on my facebook!  I can’t even load my games!”

Me: “Yes, none of that will work because your internet connection is down.  Have you tried restarting the antenna by cycling the PoE box?”


After a little bit of explaining how to find said PoE adapter, she finally unplugs the power from it and plugs it back in.

Me: “I’m able to talk to the antenna.  Can you open a browser on your PC and try to access the web?”

Sue: “NO!  I’m looking right now and it says NO SIGNAL!”

Me: “hmm, where are you seeing this message?  In the bottom right corner?”

Sue: “The screen is blank and it just says NO SIGNAL!  And I really can’t think of any signal it would be talking about other than the internet signal from the antenna up there on the roof.”

ChairForceOne,44,,32,1rh0an,,148,"So a little back story for my first post, I am an Airfield tech in the USAF. 7 years of keeping old crusty stuff going. But as a guardsmen I needed a full time gig. I currently work for Dish, I do video and internet installs and repairs. About two years now. Before that an MP, someday I really miss the fact no one yells at the dude with the machine gun. Anyway back to the tale.

I live in a small town, we service a lot of the surrounding areas. Its common to drive up to 500 miles a day. Its there van so meh. I get paid hourly.

On one of our 'out of town' days I had a job about three hours or so away, no big deal. Troubleshoot broadband. I wait until a reasonable hour and call the customer. Give her the ETA and ask her what the problem seems to be. She simply states that since day one it hasn't worked, at all. Ok, no problem I say, I'll make sure our system is up and going before I leave. I stop at some point to refill the coffee mug and realize the install was done almost six months ago, also done by one of our better techs.

When I finally get there I great the customer and she seems very friendly. First things first through my wireless router in the system in place of there ancient relic and see whats going on. Guess what? Everything is what it should be. Signal is good data is within caps, no problems. All green across the board. 

Ok, so I pull up a few sites on my phone via wifi, everything comes up fast, for satellite at least. So I connect the customers PC and see if I can get anything to come up. Its a generic dell. Hard for me to date. Its not booted so I ask the customer if its alright for me to use there PC to verify my findings. Sure she says go right ahead.

About 15 minuets later I am sitting on the desktop, windows XP, no biggie seen worse. Making small talk with the customer, she says its been slow for the past few years. Meh, I don't fix the customers or TV, not actually allowed to. Tell her its ok and I'll get it going the best I can. I open IE and afer another 5 or so minuets it pops up, I did in fact time this. She has 10 or so toolbar and who knows what else on his thing. So i try to pull up the Modem Status Page, 192.168.0.1 All internal, I wait a few minuets and nada, what page nothing loaded. So i double check on my phone, modem is still up. 

I ask the customer a very key question, when did you get this tower? She thinks for a bit, 2004. This was early 2013. Well fuck, 11 years this thing has been kicking, sorta. So i get curious and pull up the system info, 32 megs of ram. Well hell, can't remember all the details but this thing didn't come close to meeting the requirements for our internet service. She also can't remember when the last time the computer has been reformatted, if it ever has. Also it had that purple monkey guy spyware on it. Remember that from when I was a kid.

So I break the news to the customer, our side is fine, your shits all fucked up. Probably used a bit nicer terms at the time. She wont have any of that, she spent god only knows how much on that tower on the home shopping network and it had better work forever. Her car is from 2000 and is fine why isn't the computer?! Now at this point I just say ts outta my hands and start to leave, she asks, will this get me outta my contract? Maybe 6 months ago.

I have many more interesting stories to share if ya'll would like.

Gather around ya'll, and hear the story of Elijah, the most eccentric ISP user of them all.

It happened in the year 2007, I was just a 20 years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my country's largest ISP, telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living. I was half decent at my job, so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints... at night!

There were three of us during night shifts. Me, a business sector support representative, and a shift manager. The explained how things work in the land of the night -- I would get calls from ""ordinary"" customers, and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it. Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif -- the nighttime customers are batshit insane, but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah, the most batshit insane, technically inept, socially handicapped, short tempered internet user of them all.

Oh, I remember the first time I encountered Elijah's presence. It was a second order encounter, but the waves of fucking-crazy hit me like a truck. The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user. By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset. ""No! I said no! I am not going to help you with that! Because that is criminal, and not my job!"", way to go Maria! Show him what's for! After some time she eventually wore him down (we have a no-hangup policy) and he left the conversation steaming. ""Was... was that Elijah?"" I asked a question whose answer I already knew. ""Yes,"" she said, ""he wanted to hack &lt;generic dating site&gt; and asked me to tell him their IP address"".

Fast forward several months. At this point I am a top notch night rep. the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets. Oh yeah, I was getting a lot of attitude. I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times, and he always was a hoot (for example, he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software, and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesn't know English so I should translate it for him). All in all, he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction, I felt for him, which is exactly why I was not ready for things to come.

I remember that night all to well. The sea was angry that night, my friends. Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men. The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies. I had a night shift.

At first, things were working out as well as they ought to. The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone -- a narrow portion of the day, just shy of three hours long, between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasn't able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor. These hours are usually almost completely call free, up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at 3AM in the middle of the week and decided he'd rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleep.

The phone rang.

I picked it up.

""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of..."" my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semi-sentences in a voice I recognized as Elijah's. ""Listen, I have a picture. You get me? A picture. And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol. Do you understand me?"".

""...""

""Hello? Are you there? I have a picture and I...""

""Yeah yeah, I heared you the first time Elijah. Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background?"", I guessed.

""No, you don't understand. Listen, I have a picture. I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures. Do you understand me?""

""..., do you want to create a shortcut to that picture?"", an arrow in the dark.

""No! Are you even listening? Listen, I haveapictureandiwanttoputthatpicturewherethereismycomputerandthepictureofmycatandthelogoofthechatandalltheotherthingsdoyouunderstandme?""

Well, I will spare you the details, but this back and fort went on for a while and I really wanted to help that poor distraught fella even though what he was asking was not within our support limit -- mistake; I thought I understood what he wanted -- another mistake; and I proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper -- the mother of all mistakes.

As soon as we were done (even though you'd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way) he went ballistic.  I am not making a simile here, his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbit.

""What the fuck did you do?!? This is not what I wanted! Can't you do what you are told!? All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp --""

""Elijah,"" I interrupted, ""I can't help you any further"". We were on the phone for over half an hour, there was actually a call in the queue, and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support. I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation -- much more than this semi capable screw-loose -- but I had no choice, I had to do what I was trained to do... delegate!

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""No! Listen! I have a pic..."", oh no you don't! I am a brick wall!

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""But all I want to do is to use the picture to...""

""This problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""I am going to call again and talk to someone else""

""That would be a waste of your time, I am the only one here"" is what I would have said, but he already hung up. Well, what are you going to do?

Fast forward 15 minutes, my phone rings. ""This and that ISP, this is deshe, how may I be of service?"", no response, several seconds of silence, a hangup.

""Listen, John, I have a picture. I want to use that picture where the pictures and the derp urp hurpy hurp hurp"", well, that was surprising...

""Elijah, this problem is beyond our support limit, please contact Microsoft's tech support at 555-2345 anytime tomorrow between 09:00 and 17:30""

""Did I speak to you before?"" he asked, a real Sherlock that one.

""No,"" I said in my utterly regular voice, ""you must have spoken to deshe"".

""Oh yeah, that guy. Listen, all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming"" oh my god, I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence. I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft again.

So I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop (which only took 25 minutes) -- and all was good.

""Gee thanks,"" -- Elijah said, ""you are much better at this than the other guy, what did you say his name was?"", ""deshe"", ""yes, deshe. He sucks John, you could teach him a thing or two"".

""Well thanks"" I said, doing my best to conceal my laughter. I decided not to come forward, Elijah's intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually was.

And that was that, the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back, an all time Elijah classic.

**EPILOGUE**

I kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come, during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time. He was never violent or rude, just an utter loon. He was not a good person, he was of the harassing mysogenistic types (which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep. versions of the tales of Elijah), but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and bolts.

Several months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could. I was still getting e-mails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient. They decided they should not deal with him anymore. They complained and the security chief complied, issuing a formal restraining order from the police. Elijah was now formally a persona non-grata.

Fast forward three years, I am not working there anymore. I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch. One friday evening, out of the blue, I get a phone call from an unrecognized number. I took it.

""Hello""

""Listen, I have a picture!"". OK OK, that didn't actually happen.

What actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days, and well aware of Elijah's shannanigans.

""Dude!"" he told me, ""get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOW!"".

So I did. There was an episode of ""A Star Is Born"", which is the local equivalent of ""American Idol"". They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones. The guy on the screen was horrid. He was fat and obnoxious, wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains, close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene. I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had. And his voice, oh my god this voice. He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus. That voice was horrid, but it was also oddly familiar. It took me about 30 seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessing.

The song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly. ""Well, Elijah,"" they said, ""you should never sing in public. Ever"". Now, people who audition for ""A Star Is Born"" should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered, but not our unaware Elijah. No, nobody talks to Elijah like that! He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit, spitting at the judges, shouting and yelling, trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by security.

Apparently, this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show. And each time was a sight to see, though after that last one he became, again, a persona non grata.

Poor Elijah.

drexhex,22,,10,1rgojm,,109,"Said by an administrator when in a meeting about upgrading our underground fiber:

IsilZha,29,,19,1rghh8,,97,"Alright thought I'd share a headache I had to endure this August/September; it's a bit of a long story, as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every. single. point.

So here's the deal: We got a school district that's desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN. They had 6 schools running single T1 point-to-points to the District office (DO), which then ran it over a multilink T1x3 to the County office for web filtering and internet. One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link. They have an ASA firewall (just a 5505) at the DO that has their public IP - the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet. Obviously this presents a problem: Each school (except the one next door) is limited to 1.544 Mb internet; bottle-necked further by having to share 4.632 Mb on the main line out. In practice, they got between 0.02 Mb and 0.2 Mb (woohoo!)

All the schools have their own subnets and DCs. Traffic flows from the schools to the DO, through the DO's ASA, and out the County.

Behold, a diagram!  http://i.imgur.com/V65xMvP.png

Just to curb the concern; I've changed all the IPs.

The routers are mostly Cisco 2600s - the switches are HP procurve managed, layer 2 switches.

Now, they brought us in cause at the time, their IT department consisted of two people (It now consists of one) for the entire district. That madness is beside the point of this post though. This started a year ago - my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them 100 Mbit links to the DO, and a 1 Gbit link from the DO to the County Office (CO.)

We only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design, then nothing until early this year: The district met with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T drew up their own plans, completely disregarding what we had presented. Oh, and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings. So, the first thing their own IT department hears about what's happening with the upgrade, is when his bosses come to him with ""This is what AT&amp;T is doing.""

And what AT&amp;T came up with and started working on was/is, to put it lightly, atrocious.

To start off with - AT&amp;T ran 2 months behind. They were supposed to have links ready at the schools mid-summer for the change over, to avoid disrupting the schools. Instead they got the link at the DO, and 3 other links up 2 days before the start of school. So the first thing is that we need to minimize down-time.

So, here's what AT&amp;T did: http://i.imgur.com/LNAWPbU.png

Note: I removed the T1 links in the chart above to unclutter it - they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the change-over.

They ran 100Mb fiber to each school site and the CO, and 1 Gb to the DO. Yes, that's right, to start off with, the DO gets a 1Gb to take in all the connections, but the link out to the CO is only 100 Mb.

So anyway, they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber, and handed off the connection as copper at each site... except the DO - where they handed it off as Fiber. A *single* fiber link. Are you seeing another problem here? That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites, including to the CO - so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link... and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASA.

AT&amp;T's instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO: ""Just plug each site into a switch at each site, and it'll all just work."" I kid you not. ""What about all the subnetting?"" ""Oh you don't need to do any of that."" o_O Before we heard this ourselves, they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent (who is a complete jerk, and more of a hinderence than anything) that it would ""all be plug and play and just work!"" We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN information.

Other issues: No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port. The routers are full - no more connections available. The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has (inside and outside.) It will not handle VLAN tagging at all. None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN tagging.

Even though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports, they refused to give us more of them (all the others are disabled,) even though it would be a 5 minute configuration. ""That will take a change order."" ""How long would that take?"" ""About 4 weeks.""

In fact, AT&amp;T refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work. When calling their ENOC center, which is the number provided for ""support to setup your connection"" did nothing more but repeat ""just plug it into a switch at each site.""

The project manager went on a 3 week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in. After talking with our contact at AT&amp;T for days, who had been talking as though he were an Engineer, suddenly reveals ""I'm just a salesman."" God, this is explains so much...

Also, yes, they installed a link at the site next door, that already has a direct fiber link to the DO.

So, to recap:

* AT&amp;T provided a completely flat ""solution"" and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network.

* Wouldn't work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO.
*        Seriously, they wanted us to just flatten the entire network.

* Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in, and send it out.

* AT&amp;T has (and still continues to) stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their crap-tacular plan work.

It's clear from the design they came up: 1) They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO. 2) A salesman probably designed this garbage - it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs, as well as putting in crap they don't need at all (the link at the site next door - ""HERP DERP, LET'S CHARGE YOU $1100/MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINK."")

From here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn, not just from AT&amp;T. (FML!)

We got a layer 3, VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DO.

So I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration. Holy crap is the command line clunky, and the command paths make little sense. For one, backspacing doesn't work - so any mistakes; start over. Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command? Start over.

Get through that and get the web interface up. WTF is this? The GUI is convoluted and clunky - it takes 4-5 steps to configure a port and/or VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did. The fiber wouldn't come up either (normally on HP switches, it just works.) ""Screw this"" - we call up HP to help us with the configuration.

Turns out, the switch is actually a 3COM switch, re-branded as an HP switch.  &gt;:( We have to setup the fiber port as this weird ""hybrid"" port to work. Okay - we also get 4 ports setup for ""out"" (VLAN to the CO) and 4 setup for ""in"" (VLANs of the schools.)

Come back the next day - plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch. Nothing - we look - fiber link shows down. Look at AT&amp;T's equipment... link is down. It's only been 4 days, and the link at the DO is down... 

So, come back a few days later, succesfully test site-to-site, and now we also have a new Cisco 2911 to be the router for this new madness.  As well as 3 more 2600s (one site has an older router with only 1 ethernet interface, and another is so old is only 10Mb.)

The third 2600 is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch (that AT&amp;T's fiber is plugged into) and route them to the DO's network for various services (Exchange, school applications, etc.)  Then it goes out the ASA, into the 2911, which sends it to the CO's VLAN on the HP switch.

This had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic, which actually became useful.

So, we got this all setup, run some connectivity tests beforehand, and got the go-ahead to swap DO's link to the CO over, so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IP.

It's one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff.   We had been talking with him, and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over, and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end (which included moving to a different subnet.)  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for 2 weeks.  And he won't be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while he's gone.

So we're all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going.  He doesn't respond.  To anything.  We head off for the day, never getting a response from him, expecting we'll be stuck for 2 weeks now.

...he sends the school's IT guy the info late that night, and indicates he'll answer the next day.  Finally we get ahold of him the next day, and swap over, that part goes smooth - we can now pull 95Mb at the DO.

Once this was done, I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers (and preconfigured the two new 2600s) for the new stub-networks and routing.  We went to the first site, swapped the gateway over:  success!

...Sort of.

Only getting 7-16 Mb.  Test from DO again... still getting 85 Mb.  Another stumbling block.  At this point, it's 10x better than what the school was used to; we'll troubleshoot that part later (maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth? - no errors or problems on the equipment on-site), for now, we should get more schools up and running.

Next school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets; okay that's working good.  Get the next site, go to plug in and swap over... oh, AT&amp;T brought their link in at a building on the *opposite end of the campus* from the T1 and core stack (claiming there 'wasn't enough room"" - there was plenty of room, they were lazy about running the fiber; it was just easier to run it where they did.)  &gt;:(  Ended the work day on that note.

The next day we had a plan - grabbed one of those 2600s meant for another site, put it in to handle AT&amp;Ts link, swapped the gateways, confirmed up and working.  This school already had a 2600 that was used for the T1 - we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new 2600 for.  This site got full bandwidth.

Next stop is two sites that are next door to each other.  The last sites we're doing.  Both of them get the 7-15 Mb problem.  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion... I route the upsteam back through the T1.  Now we can get 50Mb down.  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO (no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is.)  I suspect I know what the problem is, will start looking into it the next day.

As it turns out, AT&amp;T, between the switches they installed on-site, and their own internal stuff, had the Duplex randomly set to half, full, or auto.  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto, or for that matter, why they weren't even consistant about it.  The 7-15 Mb issue was caused by AT&amp;Ts links having duplex mismatches all over the place. After getting the run around for an hour with AT&amp;T, we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing, and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them (set them all to auto.)  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect.  

*whew*

At this point (today) we still have one site with just a T1 link.  AT&amp;T has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it.  Again, they dropped the ball on this and didn't put in the request until late August.  We don't expect the permit will be granted for 6-8 months.  Additionally, we've had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a 1Gb link.  (We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the 1Gb.)  Still waiting on that.  So it's not quite done, but the worst is over at least.",Tales from a NetAdmin: Ep 1 - The NetAdmin vs AT&amp;T,116,TalesFromTechsupport
lawtechie,17,,6,1rgd61,,69,"

So, I'm doing tech support at an advertising agency. 
There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason, everybody but I took the same week off. Since we were an outside contractor, we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage. 

Unfortunately, all the competent people were gone. They sent me the Walrus. 

The Walrus was some guy who didn't have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer. Literally. He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheap.

He wore too-tight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fu-manchu mustache, which is how he earned the 'Walrus' nickname. He mumbled and didn't make that much sense. 

So, I'm running around like a ferret on meth and I'll take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objects.

I soon discover that he's less than useful, in a now-humorous way...

The ad agency uses the top two floors of a 3 story office building. The help desk is on the first floor, so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users. Most spares are kept in the help desk offices.

I figure I'll crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve. An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation. 

Give the Walrus directions to the artist's cube, the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I hand-hold a VP.

Ten minutes later, one of the other artists calls me.

Artist: ""Uhh, LawTechie? What's with this guy you sent up here?""

Me: ""What's wrong?""

Artist: ""I think you want to come get him""

I walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus. It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie. Turns out he didn't know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artist's Mac hoping it'd work 'this time'. The artists, sensing weakness, started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the Walrus.

I send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists. 

On my way back, one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPS/battery backup. I figure the Walrus can handle this. I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one. 

So, some explanation here. Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office, all users have battery backups. We have maybe ten spares. Every few months, we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries. I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day, since battery acid eats through clothing. 

UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with ""BAD BATTERY"" in red lettering. They're put on the shelf with ""DO NOT USE- BAD BATTERIES"", also in red lettering. 

When we replace the batteries, they go on the shelf immediately above , labeled ""GOOD BATTERIES"" in red lettering. We also remove the tape on the UPS. So bad ones are marked, good ones are ready to go. 

This protocol just can't get screwed up, can it?

I get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception. Perhaps 45 minutes have passed.

I walk back to my office, not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets. 

The Walrus comes running in, red-faced and sweaty. 

Walrus:""None of those UPS were any good""

Me:""Really? There were three that have new, tested batteries. I tested them myself. Maybe it's bad wiring""

So we walk up to the cubicle. In the trash are two strips of masking tape, with half inch block letters in red marker: ""BAD BATTERY"". 

So I walk back down, take one of the good UPS off of the ""Good Batteries"" shelf and install it. Beeping stops.

I think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks. The agency wants to build a little classroom. We need to put a 16 port dumb 10/100 ethernet switch under a table, run cable to it and make sure it lights up. 

Walrus was saying that he's more familiar with hardware than software or user support, so I hand him the drill, switch, mounting kit and some cables. I decide it's time to get some food, so I leave for 20 minutes. 

For some reason (or no reason at all), he ignores the tray like mount kit, flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the table.

Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case. 

I call up the home office and ask them never, ever to send the Walrus again.

There existed a system for passing classified data between two systems. This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better. There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for it's own purposes, using a unidirectional link to the data bus - in fact, ""passive"" was the first word in the link equipment's name. The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not (at that time, at least) have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuit.

Once the equipment was finally all installed on my end, I was able - with some coaxing *(and the elimination of some huge security breaches, for example, the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network)* - to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully. Huzzah! Great success! And many drinks were had.

But 'twas not to be so simple. Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations, things became more complicated. The remote location's RF equipment would lock up after every transmission. We would not receive data from them when the link was up. And so on. Over time, we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link, which handled the data packets in a different way, causing the equipment to lock up. We got that fixed, but we were still not receiving data from the remote location.

Eventually, after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system, a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense. They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation. On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests, I flicked to the last page. There I found a summary of the testing results, which came down to a single line:

&gt; Some tests successful with remote location 05; all other locations failed all testing

Which was *exactly* the problem we'd been having - and when 05 had replaced some equipment, it had begun to fail as well. So these were all known issues from the original testing regime, but the project manager had signed off on it, accepting the new system into service, rather than sending it back to get the issues fixed.

/headdesk + /tableflip = /locateandreattachhead

We eventually determined that the reason that remote location 05 had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for -  so when the equipment was replaced, the new equipment did not contain that library. The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that feature.

As the system experts (SE) started to pack up their gear on their final day before the 13+ hour flight back to the States, one of them turned to me and said:

&gt; SE: I'm glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out; once that firmware is in, everything should run smoothly for you.

&gt; ME: Yeah... We'll see what happens with that; I don't know if {management} will be happy to pay {manufacturer} for the license. And they really need that memory for {more important features}.

&gt; SE: Any other problems before we head back to the hotel? *Is the data injection working well?*

&gt; ME: Wait... What data injection?

Queue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available. Apparently, the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system, replacing a rather error prone manual process. The way the system was actually working (insofar as it had on occasion actually worked), the manual process was still required but was read from the new system's screen, rather than via a voice channel.

This design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device, which was shown in the documentation as a **bidirectional link**, not **unidirectional** - despite having the word ""PASSIVE"" or ""UNIDIRECTIONAL"" written next to it on every externally referenced diagram, these were missing from the diagrams included in the design document.

After the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down, the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed. I received an official commendation - although I'd rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the system's hard drives (a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive; I could have bought a nice boat at the supplier's listed price). The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number; although others have estimated it as a low eight... Had the system expert not made that one off-hand comment to me (someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible), then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into it.

Two technical project managers were reprimanded: one, for designing a system that could never possibly work; and the other, for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five (although he was already leaving anyway, so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could, effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetence).

After that, the project was never mentioned again.

Kimakishi,16,,7,1rg7ta,,42,"First time posting!  So, I'm not really a tech support person-I'm a college student who got dragged into the position of helping her tech illiterate older relatives.  
So, my godfather bought a GPS to help him visit some relatives in Nevada.  All well and good. He stopped to visit me at my campus on his way, and mentioned that he couldn't figure out how to use his GPS or change states.  Easy fix, right?  I showed him step-by-step how to enter addresses and choose a different state for the basic address. He made it to his relatives and back home quite happily.  This was about a month ago.
Fast-forward to today, when I call him to check up on him.  He tells me his GPS isn't working, so I ask what's wrong.  He tells me that, after I plugged in the addresses and he got back, he's left it sitting in his car.  That's it.  The only reason he thinks it isn't working is because he hasn't been using it.  Here's a hint: if it worked and then you didn't mess with it, it still works if you turn it on.  Of course, this is the guy who gets a new computer every two years or so because he keeps frying them with some combination of Word and IE (we still haven't figured out how) but you'd think he'd understand the concept of Working+not touching=still working.","If you haven't touched it, it's not broken.",49,TalesFromTechsupport
TncsTurtlJAH,6,,7,1rgly9,,40,"Hello TFTS,
I've been a reader on here for a while. I'm buy no means an IT guy but I'm tech savvy enough to be the goto kid in my class. This is just a shorter story but it still amazes me what high school kids don't know about technology considering our day and age. 

Today we had presentations for a project in English. Everything was running smoothly, I had brought a VGA to thunderbolt adapter for mac users so everyone could use their own laptops. Right in the middle of the period cue the inept at tech student (ITS). He gets up to the podium, sits down his laptop and presses function F5 or F7 (idk windows stuff its the display switcher). The projector is still blank. 

**ITS:** uhhh the projector is broken. My computer won't come on the screen.

I came up to see what I could do to help when I notice a dangling cord- the VGA wire *sigh*.

**I chuckled and said:** ITS, you have to plug in the cord for your computer to come up.

He blinked then laughed. Later in his presentation he has a video on youtube. He clicks on it and starts to play it but there is no sound. Now the sound had been working for everyone else except him. He plays with the volume dial on the podium and the the youtube volume. When he exits fullscreen I notice that the volume on his computer is muted. I tell him to turn it on. 

**ITS then rep****lies**: But I want it on the lowest volume because the clip is loud. -_- 

**Me:** ITS, you have to have the volume on, the red X means muted.

**ITS:** Well If you really think thats going to help.

He proceeds to turn it to 100% volume and deafen everyone in the room as a 1/2 ton of explosives goes off in his video. Thankfully no one else forgot to plug in the VGA or turn on the volume through the rest of the period.

This is my first long post to Reddit so I probably broke unwritten formatting rules somewhere. If you guys want to here more high school ineptness, just tell me!

Kynaeus,11,,7,1riijs,,33,"**CONTEXT:** So, we are the Bank's help desk and colloquially known as the central point of contact so people end up calling us for all sorts of things we don't support, which is how we come across this lovely story as certain individuals believe we have more power than is the case.

One of the things we DO support is hardware monitoring for ABMs across Canada (where people deposit and withdraw money without using a bank teller, if you're not familiar with the acronym) so we end up getting requests for ABM's which we do help with, and occasionally for things that we cannot help with. For example, ""the lights behind the sign are out!"" - not something we help with since it doesn't involve the computer. Also, change the lightbulb -why do I need to tell you to do that?

**STORY 1:**

Part of our job is to look through a particular ticketing system, as issues are 'escalated' by the auto-monitoring system they are flagged for our attention and we clear these flags when actioning the system so as I'm doing this, I come across this ticket

Fault: REQUEST (used for special requests)

Description: User advising someone was fighting in ABM room overnight and **asking for tech to clean up the blood**

Wat.

Cue a call to the branch speak to person that dispatched the issue,

Me: Hello, this is Kynaeus from the xxx technical support help desk. I'm calling in regards to this ABM - specifically I needed to know, is there any blood on the ABM?

Br: ... No

Me: Is the hardware acting improperly? Not dispensing money? Any physical damage to the customer side?

Br: No...

Me: Then ya better get someone else to clean that up, I'll be closing the ticket since this doesn't require our assistance. Have a nice day.

**Story 2:**

User: Help, my printer doesn't work!!!!!

*I can just hear the gratuitous number of exclamation marks* 

Me: Well what seems to be the problem?

Standard troubleshooting occurs for several minutes, then I ask for the error message listed on the device's touch display

U: I can't make out what it says

M: It's right on the display, white screen, big red letters. Nice and visible, just need the error from it [because the HTTP service on the device where I could look it up is not working, or the printer is off]

U: No, I can't make out the message through the smoke

M: Okay, go ahead and turn the printer off for 10 seconds the- sorry, smoke?

U: Yes there is smoke coming from the device

M: ... do you see any flames?

U: Just a small one

M: *!!!!!!!!!!*  Pull the fire alarm NOW and grab a class-C fire extinguisher if you are comfortable attempting to extinguish it, call the fire department if you are not - why did you call us for a FIRE?

**Story 3:**

*Weekends and holidays have 3rd-party support looking after ABM issues, they're auto-dispatched by the monitoring system I mentioned before*

3p: I can't access the branch to service this abm

Me: Oh - are your alarm combos not working? Key not working?

3p: No, there is a homeless gentleman sleeping in front of the door so I can't open it. What should I do?

*seriously? What do you people think I can do about this*

Me: ... I'd start by asking him to move. If he won't and you can't access a different entrance, just make note and return tomorrow, this really isn't a critical issue and doesn't need to be looked at right now.",Why did you call technical support for that?,40,TalesFromTechsupport
Matvalicious,0,,1,1riix1,,21,"I work for an IT support company that does both residential as well as commercial customers. Today, a residential customer walks in. Completely stressed out because he is missing a lot of e-mails! He slams his laptop on my desk ranting about his e-mails while I turn on the laptop. Windows has booted, I connect him to our WiFi and ask him to open his e-mail client. 
""It's just my e-mail, it's right there, just open it."" (Not pointing or moving himself or anything). I say I don't know how he reads his e-mails, he could be using webmail, or Outlook, or Windows Live Mail,... (No desktop icons). 
He proceeds to open Windows Live Mail with a bit of confusion on his face. ""There! You see it?"" He rapidly scrolls through the e-mails telling me there is a huge gap between yesterday and a date about a month ago. I notice he is using the ""Unread email"" view, so I switch to his Inbox and show him all his missing e-mails. ""But no! That's not how I read my e-mail, I always use this one"" (Goes back to Unread Email). 
I try to explain him the difference between Unread mail and the Inbox. It took me about 10 minutes before he would believe me telling him his e-mail was still there and eventually I think he got the difference between the two folders. 
He then ends the intervention with: ""Because I got this problem before and then a friend of mine who is really into computers told me I had to switch to Offline mode to get it fixed but now all my e-mails were gone..."" 
No sir.. They weren't and your friend is an idiot.",Where are my e-mails?,22,TalesFromTechsupport
linuxape,3,,3,1rhdfx,,10,"Background- I work on a help desk for a private multinational company that provides call center solutions. I work out of our corp HQ and each respective center has 2-3 on site techs for hardware issues and troubleshooting stuff that is hard to do remotely. This is a story of their fail.

Now we have a large citrix setup and laptop/VPN options for many people to work from home. I actually only spend about 3 hours a day in the office thanks to citrix. 
However, today I'm busy working on a report for an audit that is coming up and my phone rings. One of our centers HR people is working from home and their VPN connection timed out due to non-use and kicked them off. 
When they signed back into the VPN Exchange kept asking for their AD creds and Lync was saying it couldn't connect to Exchange.

So this user first contacts the Lead DTS guy at her building. He tells her that he can't figure out why Outlook will not connect back to Exchange and tells her to call the help desk.

So I use Lync to view her laptop and verify this is indeed an issue and simply restarting Outlook doesn't resolve the problem. So since this user is on the VPN the next obvious thing is to have her try our secondary connection. And just like magic everything works. Amazing how both the user and I could have saved time if the DTS person thought of that.

TL;DR- Local DTS forgets how to swim, tells the user to call the helpdesk for a life raft. ",Troubleshooting? What's that?,13,TalesFromTechsupport
