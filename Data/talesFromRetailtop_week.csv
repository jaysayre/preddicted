rainbowcake12,330,,729,1rf59b,,1705,"I was working cashier at my job when a very unattractive, middle aged obese white man with gray stubble and teeth that were waaaay too tiny for his mouth stepped up. I opened my mouth to greet him, but he spoke before I could say anything. 

""So I heard that [bakery/caf√© where I work] only puts their prettiest girls on the cash register,"" he sneered. His rotting fish breath hit me in the face. 

""What can I get for you today sir?"" 

""I'm not done talking to you yet. What do you think about what I just said?"" 

""I can't really confirm any kind of allegations against the company, sir."" 

""Ah, so you don't think you're pretty."" 

""It's not that at all sir. Can I take your order?"" 

""So you DO think you're pretty. The prettiest one here, maybe."" 

""No, not really."" 

""Well I certainly do.""

""Thank you, that's very kind of you to say,"" I said in as monotone of a voice as possible. ""Have you decided what you'd like to order today?"" 

""Let me give you the phone number to look up my member card,"" he breathed at me. I tried not to gag as I punched it into the computer as fast as I could.

""Okay, you have x, y, and z rewards on your card, would you like to use any of those today?"" 

""No, but there's one reward I WOULD like,"" he smirked and licked his lips. ""You have my number, but I'm not ordering until I get yours."" 

My mouth opened in shock. I just kind of stood there for a few seconds while he grinned at me, not really knowing what to say. 

""Sir, she's not an item on the menu,"" the man behind him in line with his arms full of squirming toddler spat at him. ""Either order some food or leave this poor girl alone. She's just trying to do her job."" The man huffed and stepped out of line, tripping on the edge of the mat as he stormed out of the store.

BigTeddyted,156,,354,1r99z1,,1237,"So I work in an autopart store, and here in California it finally started to rain. This usually means we get a rush of people buying wiper blades and wanting them installed on their car. We do this for free because we go ""the extra mile."" 

We recently hired two new female employees  and they still haven't gotten used to putting wiper blades on, so I'm the only one able to do it. 

We start to get really busy and there's a bunch of people waiting on me to put their blades on. Its raining and I'm getting soaked so I'm in a not so good mood. 

So I'm helping this old lady put her wiper blades on and she is thanking me and trying to give me a $20 tip which I refuse because we can't take tips ( I would have made a lot of money today but since I'm one if the supervisors I can't accept it.) 

She then proceeds to drop the money, gets in the car and just winks and waves at me as she is leaving. I smiled and picked up the $20 bill and waved back. That made my whole day.

metamaxwell,386,,386,1r14xk,,1111,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

kwinbot,89,,220,1r7923,,985,"Little backstory first: I was in a car accident in august, and even after insurance and taking care of everything, the woman driving the car I hit still bothers me. Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

CB: You said you would pay cash to get my car fixed

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

FredFltStn,123,,337,1r2ps1,,982,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It‚Äôs 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  We get our fair share of Spanish speaking customers at my location, and I try to have at least one cashier working that can speak Spanish, just to smooth things along. I don‚Äôt speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish). I was actually busy trying to stock one of the shelves at the time, so I shook my head no and held up one finger for the universal ‚Äúone moment‚Äù sign. I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

About 10 minutes later, the two guys are shopping on the aisle across from where I was stocking, and talking to each other in Spanish. I‚Äôm really not paying much attention to them, when I thought I heard one of them say something like ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs at the table, put it in the bag.‚Äù

I walk around the aisle, and one of the guys is holding a brick of firecrackers in one hand, and a large shopping bag from a different store in the other hand. I look in the other direction, and my cashier is at the front register checking someone out.

I walked up them smiling and said, ‚ÄúBastardo barato, get out.‚Äù

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

Not_A_CEO,180,,222,1rdpxf,,907,"Here's a relatively short tale today, folks.

I've posted here a few times before, and it should bear mentioning that I'm a bank teller and have been for 5+ years.  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a Teller.

I had gone through the mandatory 30-day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors, and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank.  I was technically under the 90 day Probationary stage, but for all intents and purposes I was a full-fledged employee.  Two weeks go by, and I'm steadily getting more and more comfortable.  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes, until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pants.

A customer walks in, hands me his $800 payroll check, and says he'd like to deposit it into his account.  *All right, no problem, here's your receipt, have a nice day.*  He leaves, and that's that.  Or so I thought.  About 10 minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says, ""Hey, Not_A_CEO, did you help this guy a few minutes ago?""

When I acknowledge that I did, in fact, help him with this deposit, my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guy's account and to tell him if I noticed anything ""off.""  So I did...and immediately noticed something wrong.  There's a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current day--I can see if he's been to the grocery store, a gas station, or if he's made any deposits.  Sitting in the Deposit section is...wait for it...a deposit made 10 minutes ago for the nice little sum of $100,000,000.  With my teller signature on it.

Read that sentence above again for me, would you?

**I deposited one hundred million dollars into this guy's account when it only should have been $800 dollars.**

Noticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket, and the words *Ohshitohshitohshit* start to fly about in my mind.  I'm currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me.  He affectionately calls me an idiot, and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount (which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that point).

Turns out, I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section, which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited.  Management thought it was hilarious, and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix, but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on me.

j_guazu,97,,174,1raji3,,654,"I work in customer service at our country's state-owned electricity company. Yesterday was one of days when the technicians go around disconnecting anyone who owes over three months of bills, and I had the joy of being one of the reconnections desks dealing with the hundreds of pissed off people that had been cut off. There were a lot of idiots among them, but one guy really stood out. He came up to my window, told me his power was shut off and that he couldn't find the bills to bring with him.

Me: No problem, do you have your meter number?

Him: No.

Me: Ok then, what's your address?

Him: Two blocks from the San Miguel church on route 2, the road with the petrol station.

Me: I need to know the name of the road and the house number.

Him: Well most people call it *random nickname related to the petrol station*.

Me: But what does the city call it?

Him: It's 'Sargeant something'.

Me: Yeah, I can't do anything unless I have the bill, the meter number or the address. Could you go and call someone at the house, have them tell you the meter number and then re-join the queue?

He wasn't pleased about having to queue all over again, but went off to call whoever. Eventually he works his way back down the line, reappears at my window and reads the number off his phone:

Him: It's 1754 and the last number is either 2 or 3.

Me: What?

Him: She says the wheel for the last number is turned halfway between 2 and 3.

Me: That's not the meter number. That's the number that tells you how much electricity you've used. The meter number is nine digits and it's on the grey sticker underneath where it says ""meter number"".

I got an evil-glare from him as he went off to find out the actual number and queue for a third time. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him on his final visit to the windows, but my colleague did. He managed to get the correct number and pay what he owed, but got angry when she told him his power would be back ""within 24 hours"". He snapped at her that he had eight chickens in the fridge that were all going to go bad if he wasn't reconnected immediately, and that he's going to write a formal complaint to the company about both of us and to demand some kind of recompense for the chickens.

AAEmmerson,76,,102,1r7jes,,643,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about ¬£4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

diinomunster,71,,106,1rcku1,,393,"Hello my lovelies. I had a wonderful 4p-8a shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas station/C-Store. (I'm a softy who just can't say no). This offense happened around 2am. 

Now my gas station is in a really dumb place. We're in the main Highway of our city which is why we're a 24/7 store, but we're in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I don't see much traffic between midnight and four am. That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us. (Somewhere because there's a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart, a pizza Hut, a burger restaurant, a funeral home [yeah idk either], and then the bar is somewhere in that mess). 

So anyway between 130 &amp; 230 I get a nice hour of drunks. Our local police force is always really nice. They know that it's either me (5'3"" 115lbs female) or J (scrawny, but seriously awesome, little white guy) working alone. I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic. The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store. (I seriously give these guys so much free coffee). 

The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had, fresh out of the Academy. Super nice guy. Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss (we get them fresh every day so they aren't dried out if they were bagged) and thanked them when they said they'd be keeping an eye out for me. Around 150ish they had nabbed a drunk driver (yay team!) and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street. 

Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout (I'm on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit). The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store. When you walk in there's the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right, coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall. You have to walk around to your right, following the counters, to leave through the exit door. This is so you can't sneak out behind us and steal something. 

Queue 2am. I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy who's browsing our snack food quietly. In comes this super drunk middle aged black male. He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall (it's about 4.5 feet high). He will be Drunk Guy (DG). 

DG: Hey! How much for a cab to Menomininity? (I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us). 

Me: I'm not sure. We can call a cab and ask. Do you have a certain cab company you like to use? 

DG: just look some numbers up for me on the Internet. 

Me: I don't have the Internet here. I have a phone book though you can borrow. 

Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for. 

DG: NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK! 

Yeah... Okay? He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms. On his way he took out the fruit stand, the magazine rack, and the little employee break table in the hallway. 

Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom. ""That black guy grabbed me by the jacket, pulled me out of the stall, then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me."" 

Uhh.. What? 

The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit (despite me telling him he didn't have to because I have to throw it all away anyway) insists he'll stay until this guy leaves. 

Me: Yeah I don't have the time for this. I'm just calling the police. 

I get on the phone with none emergency, explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in. Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer. 

DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic.. And then he sees the officer. 

DG: AW THE FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCH!

the officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didn't fight. I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense. College kid dipped out at some point (I think he was underaged). A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as I'm talking to RideAlong for my statement. Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole. His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar. 

Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at 130 like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks can't hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster. They also haven't been letting the drunk patrons use their phone. For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone. Yeah. Screw them. 

DG got hauled off, I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up. The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation. I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders. 

I thankfully had last night and tonight off so I'll see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better. 

Well it's bed time. Sorry for the sleepy rambling. Good night TFR.

notanangel_25,44,,59,1rehs5,,388,"Hi TFR!  My first post as I've recently started at a big box electronics retailer for the holidays.  I'm no stranger to retail though as this will be my 3rd Black Friday, one year at a department store and the other at a toy store that went out of business.

Just a quick story about a customer from yesterday.  My department is right near the DVDs and we don't have any dedicated staff manning the DVD section so obviously if someone asks for help finding something whoever would just help them.  Anyway, a woman asks for help looking for a DVD.  We'll call her Clueless Woman (CW).

*CW:  Hi I'm looking for a DVD.*

*Me:  Sure what's the name of it?*

*CW: The Counselor.*

*Me: Let's go.  It sounds familiar, how long ago did it come out?*

We get to the DVD section and I begin looking for the movie.

*CW: Oh the end of last month.*

I stop looking and turn to her, 

*""You mean it's still in theaters?*

*CW: Yea, probably, so do you have it in stock?*

*Me: Um, typically movies are in theaters for a few months, maybe 3 months or so.  So the earliest you could possibly see a DVD for a movie that came out a month ago would be February or March.*

*CW:  Could you just check in the back?*

*I directed her over to a computer where I searched the item and showed her it didn't exist yet.  She proceeds to ask me about a TV show which is in it's first season on TV right now.*

*CW: So I also want the DVD for this show called Betrayal on ABC.*  

*Me: Sure.*  

Since I'm at the computer, I look to see if we have it.

*Me:  I'm sorry nothing's coming up. How many seasons does it have so far?*

*CW:  Um, I think 1.*

I end up googling it and find out it's currently on TV.

*Me:  Well the show is currently being aired on TV so there would be no DVDs available until the show is done.*  

*CW:  When will that be?*

*Me:  Well it depends if their season goes a full season or a half season.  Again you're talking the earliest March-ish and more likely the Summer or Fall.*

*CW:  Oh ok.  Can I watch it online?*

*Me: Sure you can watch it on ABC.com, or Hulu.com*

*CW:  But I don't have a computer.*

*Me: Well depending on your tv provider, you can maybe watch it free ondemand.  Or if you can access the internet through your TV or other device...*

*CW: How would I do that?*

*Me: Do you have wifi at home?*

*CW: So that means my TV can just connect?!*

*Me: Um, about how old is your TV?*

*CW:  I've had that old TV for years.  It might be as old as you, haha.*

Me:  Then no, you can't connect to the internet unless you have a another device like a gaming console or dvd player.*

*CW:  So... maybe I should just buy a tablet so I can watch it right?*

*Me:  Umm, that's an option...if that's what you want...*

*CW:  And I'll be able to watch the Counselor on there too right?*

*Me:* ****facepalm****  *Ma'am the movie is still in theaters, no DVD is going to come out until next year.  Even then it will take awhile before you'd be able to watch it online.*

*CW:  It's fine.  So tell me about the Nexus iPads.*

*Me:...*

I go through the whole spiel of showing her the different tablets and then she stops me mid-sentence and asks the price of the tablet I was telling her about even though it was right there in front of it.

*Me:  Well this tablet is actually on sale right now for $359.*

*CW:  What!?  That's too much money just to watch this movie.*  

Then she just walks out of the store.","""I'm sorry, what you're looking for doesn't exist yet""",447,talesFromRetail
calador,41,,86,1rdykp,,381,"In 2002, I worked for a national discount department store that had filed for bankruptcy. I was the Upfront Supervisor and worked the Customer Service desk. The company decided to close stores in waves. My store was in wave two. The closing did the usual ""Store Closing! X0% off! Everything Must Go!"" signs everywhere. In smaller print under this was the caveat ""All sales final. No exchanges or returns."" This was printed on the receipt and an employee stood at the door highlighting this line and repeating it verbally before thanking them for their business. 

We were about two months into the 3 month closing sale when this 30-something man who we will call DC comes in wearing nice clothes that obviously came from one of the high-end malls within a 20 minute drive of our store.

DC was carrying a box for an RC car. He drops it on the counter in front of me and asks for a refund. I apologize and tell him that I can't give him a refund as we were closing and all sales were final. I mentioned that the manufacturer's warranty was still valid and he could contact them for repair or replacement. He started getting upset. For five minutes or so, he proceeded to verbally harangue me and said that the reason our store was closing was ""poor customer service."" I tried in vain to calm him down as he got louder and more vulgar. Finally, I asked him to either quiet down or leave. He spoke right over me, telling me where to shove this broken RC car. I snapped. 

&gt;Me: Sir, I have repeatedly asked you to calm down. Unfortunately, all sales are final. We are closing. We have signs on all the support poles and every aisle in the store saying this. Your receipt says this. There is no excuse for you to come in here and harass me like this. Now, shut up or get the hell out of my store before I call security and the police to escort you in handcuffs for trespassing. 

&gt;DC: You can't talk to me like that! I am a Customer! The customer is always right! Where is your manager. I want to talk to them about this.

&gt;Me: Sir, I have waited 6 long years to say this to one of you pretentious pricks. Shut up! You are not always right. In this case, you are definitely wrong. I have told you several times that I can do NOTHING for you. Sure, I can get my manager here. They will tell you the same thing I have been trying to get past your perfectly styled thick hair. 

*I turn and point at the Hardlines Assistant Manager. She is biting her lips to keep from laughing out loud. I can hear the laughter in her voice as she tells her customer all sales are final and thanks for the business.*

&gt;In fact, she is standing right behind me at the register, ringing customers up and telling them exactly what I have been telling you. WE. ARE. CLOSING. So, what are they gonna do? FIRE ME?!? The store closes in a month. I and everyone here is losing their jobs already. Now. GET. THE. HELL. OUT. OF. MY. STORE!

*DC immitates a fish gasping for water for a moment before turning bright red.*

&gt;DC: You have not heard the last of this. I am calling your corporate office to complain.

*He leaves in a huff, forgetting his RC car. HLM, the manager I mentioned bursts into laughter. Through her teary hiccups, she turns and looks at me.*

&gt;HLM: How long has that been bottled up?

&gt;Me: 6 long years.

&gt;HLM: You hid it well. Glad you got it off your chest?

&gt;Me: Felt good.

At this point, DC comes back in, glares at me, and snatches his RC car off the counter. I merely smile and 
tell him to have a nice day and thanks for the business.

&gt;DC: F*** you, a******!

&gt;Me: Sorry, wouldn't want to dislodge that stick you have shoved up your backside. Bye!

Frenchington,77,,63,1r4g7b,,335,"You know how you ""normal"" people out there seem to put your carts away in the designated areas? It makes sense doesn't it?
Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

jessajuhanabi,30,,96,1rhnqp,,387,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

Jasonresno,8,,71,1r8zpa,,311,"After 5 years of slaving away at a job in retail (working my way up to management) while I studied and completed school I finally got to put my two week notice in. Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

So it's my last day of work and I've been relaxing and laughing with everybody. The phone rings.

Me (M), Customer (C).

M: Hello, this is XXXX. How can I help you?

C: Yeah. I see this product online. It's a XXX. Do you have one.

-It's not something we carry, exactly. I do have alternatives.

M: No, I'm sorry sir. We don't carry that line of products. I do have a---

C: You don't? What?

M: No, sir, we don't work with that company--

C: Seriously? You don't?

M: No, but I do have an alternative and --

C: Listen, kid, I've been buying from you guys for years. And every year you have less and less in your store. Why are you even open if you don't have what I want?

-I'm taken aback and instantly angry. I've gotten to the point where I don't react well to rude customers on the phone.

M: Due to a number of economic reasons we've focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves. It helps small companies like us stay competitive.

C: Really. Really? So you're telling me you just sell garbage?

-I pause in disbelief and just wait. The man is silent too.

M: Is there anything else I can help you with?

-Instantly angry he responds.

C: Apparently not since all you sell is trash. Really can you even

-And then I'm pretty much seeing red and I interrupt him. Sarcasm so thick I almost choked on it.

M: Yep. You're right sir. All we sell at my store is garbage. Nothing useful, just trash. Thanks for calling and please don't call back.

And then I hung up. Went over to my manager, explained what happened, and that was that. My boss didn't care. I'm done there. Feels good.","""So you guys pretty much only sell garbage now, right?"" or how I happily chewed out a customer on my last day of work.",382,talesFromRetail
Tufty89,32,,58,1rdse5,,291,"*This is a story from long, long ago, that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit. I thought you all might enjoy it.*

This happened a while ago, but it just popped into my head, so I'm gonna do my best to remember it.

I used to work nights on the checkout of a 24 hour supermarket. Now, in this particular store, there were certain things that you couldn't do on the checkout without a manager's key and a code, generally, anything that would change the total by more than ¬£2, including voiding items, would require you to call a manager.

Since we worked nights, they gave the key and the code to 2 women who worked on the cigarette kiosk, because they had worked there for a long time, there was always at least one of them working and they didn't want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake. All worked fine normally.

Until the day that neither of these women were in. Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area? Did they buggery.

There were 3 of us working that night, and the other 2 were quite new on the department. We did our best, but I was the first to go down. A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided. I put a call out for the on duty manager, then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes. The line wasn't very long, because it was getting quite late. There was a little grumbling, but everyone seemed fairly understanding.

5 minutes pass. I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY. I advise everyone to start going through the other 2 tills. I am starting to get worried, but we still have 2 tills running, so it's not the end of the world. The lines get longer.

Then, one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice. It happens, the scanners sometimes just glitch. The item cost more than ¬£2, and bam, 2 checkouts are locked down. I direct people through the lone surviving till. The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done. I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly. No answer. I call again. Nothing. I put another call out over the speakers. Apologise to all customers.

Then it happens. The last till goes down. Another double scan. The line is 15 people deep. And this is at midnight, when it's odd to have more than 1 customer at a time. I try to call the manager again. Nada. I call a team leader, explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager, any manager. I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain what's going on. I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness. Some fo them have been waiting for 20 minutes. I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isn't anything I could do. I wish there was something, anything I could do. We can't open any other tills. They are all shut down, and even if I had the key to turn them on, all of our log in's are locked into these tills.

Finally, someone saunters to the tills. They aren't a manager. They had been sent down by the on duty manager, because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator. I'm getting frantic. I send her back to find the manager.

Time passes. People have been waiting for over half an hour now, and you can imagine what that looks like. Thankfully, none of the customers are directing their anger at us, but they are all very, very angry.

Eventually, the manager turns up. All good right? Nope.

He takes one look at the scene. And walks away. The customer's see my face. Now they know what the manager looks like.

There is more of the same. Frantic phone calls, announcements over the speakers. Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later, the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd. The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me, it seems my pleas for forgiveness worked

The manager is barely listening to the poor people. He keeps interrupting them, trying to push blame off of himself. This was the first he had heard of the situation. Luckily, all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him. The manager eventually rolls his eyes, and wanders off to the office to pick up the keys.

A full 45 minutes after the last till went down, we finally got the code and unlocked the tills. Did the manager apologise to the customers? Nope. Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait? Nope. Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that? Take a guess.

As I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them. It wasn't much, but I would accept any coupon they had, even if they weren't for our store. I would ""accidentally"" mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off. If something wouldn't scan, I'd just pretend I hadn't noticed and give it to them. I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble, but I just didn't care at this point. When we cleared the line, I sent the other 2 girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it. When they were gone and I was sure I was alone, I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering. ",Cashier's Nightmare,349,talesFromRetail
blackaurora,20,,56,1r5trc,,295,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

genericname11,28,,41,1r72se,,280,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I‚Äôd much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being ‚Äúbacking‚Äù). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That‚Äôs why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it‚Äôs a land yacht. It‚Äôs being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it‚Äôs a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she‚Äôs going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

‚ÄúHey, you!‚Äù She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don‚Äôt register that she‚Äôs talking to me.

‚ÄúHey, cart guy!‚Äù She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

‚ÄúDo you ned help unloading?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNo. I want to know why you dented my car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working on the other side of the lot. I haven‚Äôt been in this area for a while.‚Äù

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. ‚ÄúYou left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?‚Äù

Ugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.‚Äù

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

‚ÄúYou have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe says you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? I‚Äôm not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. Be careful. I don‚Äôt want this happening again.‚Äù

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.‚Äù

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it‚Äôs bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

‚ÄúYou just totaled a $60,000 car!‚Äù

Now, I did not handle this well.

‚ÄúYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.‚Äù

Second rule of retail: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù It should not be, but it is.

‚ÄúI want to talk to a manager right now!‚Äù

Yuppie-Husband parks his ‚Äútotaled‚Äù car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: ‚ÄúThis kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?‚Äù

Side note: ‚ÄúTotaled‚Äù is short for ‚Äútotal loss‚Äù This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

‚ÄúLets discuss it in my office.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was ‚Äúmy turn.‚Äù

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don‚Äôt have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband‚Äôs fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

themonkeyone,39,,52,1r7frc,,258,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

Legionofclowns,54,,68,1rcc3t,,257,"First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones I've been reading on here. It's long so be forewarned. 

So it's 2006 and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis. I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt, working in the DVD/CD/Video Games area and had become one of the goto guys. The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday; we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everything.....hopefully. The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo, for this was the year of the Wii. 

Now before this i had worked with the public. Had worked at the movie theater, fast food, etc. but this was my first real retail job. I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the news.

Day comes and of course I'm there at open. I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see? A line that stretches from the door, goes around the store, comes back to the front doors, and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store. I think ""no big deal we got this."" We start handing out the tickets, before opening, for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the 30 Wiis we managed to have. And within 5 minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didn't get what and the standard bickering. Not worried, we have a cop outside keeping order. 

So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working, customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown. NOPE! 

Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of ""THEY HAVE EM!"" and ""I HAD IT FIRST BITCH!""  Going into ""oh shit"" mode I briskly jog (flat out run) to the bay and witness about 20 soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway, pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way, and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way. I mean seriously, how many times do you get to see a middle-class housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter?  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees. 

At this point I have to make a decision....do I (A.) Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or (B. ) Stop a possible murder. I go with B. and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP. I get into the bay and WHOOMP, I'm out. Don't remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor. Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system. 

At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying. When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me, but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC-10 at anything not wearing a uniform. The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure I'm alright (SPOILER: I didn't die) More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name (I'm humorous most of the time so I said Garfield, that's how they knew I was ok). I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash (still have the scar) I'm good, in fact I'm ready to go back to work. 

Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras.  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away. I've never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my 7th (although I'm with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazon.com wasn't a competitor, damn restructuring).

tl;dr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that I'm Edward James Olmos on a jetski.

So anyway, I am new at my work, and I am a casual at a Jeweler. This was my first job so I put up with most stuff I didn't really like as I didn't want to cock it up. I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise. For about another month, Karen the Boss, would walk around quoting the bible, telling us in private how god is present when we work and how he is the one making us an income (I never saw him working once in the store) and how we wouldn't have jobs without him...Mostly the usual Bible-Thumper stuff. This was all until I finally blew up, in front of customers...She questioned me why I never wear a Cross or St Christopher medallion and how as it was ""part"" of the dress code, I could be fired for not wearing it. I turned to her and told her my ""view"" on everything she said, she started yelling, threatening to fire me I ended up resigning on the spot and I walked out. 

Skip ahead a month...Found out she had been ""Let Go"" due to workplace harassment that was tied in with her 'views' and she was reported for Harassing me and others by my colleagues.

LIVES_IN_CANADA,108,,73,1rbn62,,246,"So I used to work for a large department store in the front-end (cash and customer service mainly). At our location we had 24 cash registers, 10 of which were express (10 items or less) and the other 14 were regular belts. We also had 6 self-checkout machines that were watched over by 1 cashier at a time. This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them. 

Now I don't remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was, but I do remember that it was very busy. We had every single register open and we still had lines of 3-6 people at each register. 

When I'm watching the self-checkouts I'm watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the 48-pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned. I also have to help people out when they have coupons as 95% of the time the machine doesn't recognize them, as well as any and all questions about their purchases/prices/payment methods. So basically I'm busy running around the whole time.

So this day, while I'm watching the self-checkouts, two women who were next in the seemingly never-ending line come to one of the machines nearest to me. One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women (I found out it was the pregnant women's mother). Nothing note worthy happens with them until they're at their last item. It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart. The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness (I think she said cancer). 

Now they choose to come to a self-checkout machine. A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out. They didn't think to wait in one of the 24 other lines where you'd have a dedicated cashier who'd be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you. No, they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watch/help 6 customers simultaneously to lift and scan their item(s). 

So all that went through my head, but what came out of my mouth was ""Sure, no problem!"" and I started walking towards them (they were ~6 feet away from me). I take not more than 2 steps before the daughter says ""Oh it's alright mom, I've got this"" and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself. The mom notices that I didn't match Usain Bolt's world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me, ""What awful service you have, forcing a pregnant woman to lift &lt;item name&gt; by herself.""

I just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if they'd like more hands on service that going to one of the non-self-checkout registers would probably be better. The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on me:

""I guess some people's mothers just didn't raise them right.""

What!?! I don't know what she expected me to do, maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item? I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me, so I ignored her. It's been years since that's occurred and it's still the experience from retail that I remember best.

groundciv,28,,52,1r4jqn,,227,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

If you've read my previous posts on here, I try to show how much fun I have with the people I worked with as we have plenty of horror stories on this sub-reddit. I've worked with a fantastic group of people,  Black Friday was no different. 

I woke up at 2am, getting ready to start my twelve hour split shift. I was to work from 3am to 11am then come back and work 6pm to closing. A pretty long day to say the least. I grabbed a couple of five hour energies, and jumped into my gaming department. Today was some of the holiday paid workers' first day, so they were mainly there to direct people around the store. This is the story of one of those fellas. We'll call him G. 

I began talking with my group, showing them what we wanted to sell, reminding them of the deals to promote etc. While I did this, the group of people came in. 

The way we did it, was we had a route for all customers to follow no matter what. People were to follow this route until they got to the department of their choosing. They were to grab what they wanted, then move back into the line as the route ended at the registers. It was a very organized system to say the least. While the people were being herded through the lines, I began to hear screaming. 

This wasn't a AHHHH I'M IN TROUBLE kind of screaming this was a YEAHH WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!!! kind of screaming. My customers as if they were queued by a director all looked towards the isle, as did I. It was G. He was standing there holding the festive balloons cheering on our customers. 

**G:** OH you got THAT AWESOME LOW PRICED WII?? CONGRATS MAN WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!

You have to realize, this is a high ceiling open area store, and everybody in the store can hear him. 

**G:** BBBBLLLLACCCCKKKK OOOOPPSSS!!!! WOOOO HOOO!!! YOU GOT IT BRO! All I gotta say man is ZOMBIES!!! KILL THE ZOMBIES MAN!!!! 

I began to realize he was cheering our customers on, and just having a good old time. As he did this, other holiday people who also just started on Black Friday began to shout and cheer the customers on. I guess they thought this guy who started it all was somebody who had worked there for a while, and they thought it was normal. 

Basically, I thought it to be fantastic. I had one of the radios on me, and knowing that none of the new guys had radios, I began to talk about it. 

**Me:** You guys hear that? 

**Manager:** You mean the likely sound of epic tickling?

**Me:** Your neighbors must complain a lot if your wife sounds like a male screaming when you tickle her. 

**Manager:** Yeah you'd be surprised. Tell the new guys to put a cork in it. 

**Me:** Well, the customers kind of like it. 

**Manager:** They like being tickled eh? 

**Me:** ...

**Me:** Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.

**Manager:** Well who am I to stop them then?

**Me:** Yeah seriously, you're not God. 

It got to the point where most of the new people (and some of the regular employees) began to do this, all because of G. 

I don't work there anymore, but recently I visited the store to see some old friends. G is still there, and he's a supervisor now. I think the man deserves it, as long as he doesn't tickle our customers.

arsci991,56,,36,1ren2b,,214,"All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories, one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe. It's kind of a long one, but hopefully you all enjoy it!

A little background: I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items, including gun safes. This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year. We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see, with the largest (at the time) being an Canon Armory 80-gun safe. This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock. Our store only ever had 2 of them, they never had an official SKU#(we had to ring them under the generic ""merchandise"" SKU), we had them for over a year, and after we sold out we never saw them again. Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer, but they all ship with the same combination: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes, or by just guessing. It was no secret, and we encourage people to take a good look.

It was the evening, and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day. Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down. I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by, and he looked PISSED. And not just ""end of black friday"" pissed but ""someone done fucked up"" pissed, so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe. Literally ear to the door, asking if it was doing alright. Maybe not to the safe, but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe. Uh Oh. Things start running through my head...why didn't he just unlock it? HOW did a person get locked in it? Then he pulls me aside.

Assistant Manager: ""We have a situation.""

Me: ""A situation?""

AM: ""Yes, a kid just locked his brother in the 80-gun.""

Me: ""Soo why don't we unlock it?""

AM: ""It won't unlock. I think the battery died, but I replaced it and it's still not working.""

Me: ""How did he end up locked in it?""

AM: ""His brother apparently. He's over hiding in the feed racks last I saw. Not sure where the parents are, they haven't made an appearance yet.""

I went over and tried it myself, and sure as crap...it's locked. And this kid is FREAKING out, for obvious reasons. We tried a couple other batteries with no luck, and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other 80-gun, with no luck. The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs. 

We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little, and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup. Assistant Manager called the police, while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safe.

After about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out, we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a 5 minute lockout on the keypad...if the battery dies or is removed, you can't touch it for 5 minutes after putting the battery back in. So after 5 long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions, the safe OPENED. And this 15 year old kid, I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe, straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears. 

The police and fire department left pretty quick after that, but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us. Complaining about precautions, safety, how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently. Eventually we stopped her,

AM: ""Ma'am, your kid walked up to the safe, entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe. Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did, the battery died. At this point the brother closed and locked the door. And it's our fault for not taking enough precautions?""

Eventually the woman and her kids left. No policies changed, except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do. Gives us all a good chuckle. Every couple months she calls, and identifies her self as ""the person whose kid got locked in the safe."" Usually she's prying to know if we've changed our policies (we haven't) then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of (which she doesn't get). Oddly enough, its been another year and we've had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes!

SenorPierre,25,,49,1r0aps,,195,"what's up, Tales From Retail. I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

manager ""oh, okay then. have a good day, SenorPierre.""

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,199,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

prickelypear,23,,27,1rf2t9,,187,"I've lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can remember.

I used to work in a big name retail store in a college town, we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously, and they were generally pretty laid back customers. But of course we got older customers as well.

One night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line. It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come. One of items was a basket, it looked like wicker but I don't remember what it was exactly. Either way when I rang it up it came up full price, ~$30-$40, and the woman stopped me.

**Woman:** That's supposed to be on sale, why is it ringing up full price?

**Me:** I'm not sure, I'll get one of the girls from that department to come up and she'll know what's going on.

While I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle (which this store doesn't have, we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much) and how this is so aggravating. Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the ""Clearance aisle"" and it's ringing up full price and she knows it wasn't placed there by another customer because there were many of them there. The girl from hard lines informs the woman we don't have a Clearance Aisle, but she knows where the baskets are and she will go look.

While we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up. Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others. The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale, the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one, it's full price and walks off. 

**Woman:** (to me) Well he needs the basket for his clothes.

**Me:** Okay (and I start to place it in the bagging area)

**Woman:** No! I'm not paying that price for it. I want it for the Clearance price! You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price. 

I don't remember what she was saying the ""Clearance price"" was, but it was far below the actual price. Usually if its less than $5-$6 we were told just give it to them, and even sometimes if it's $10 on something worth at least $35. But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be $15.

**Me:** Ma'am we don't have a Clearance aisle, the basket is full price and I don't have a way to lower it in my system.

**Woman:** That's bullshit, if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you *can* adjust the price!

**Me:** This store *doesn't have* a Clearance Aisle. We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isn't one of them.

**Woman:** No. That basket was on the Clearance Aisle. Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale. That one is too. I'm getting that basket but I am *not* buying ~$30-$40 for it. Where are the managers? This is bullshit I'm not dealing with you anymore.

So, with the woman's son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes, I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up. I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time; manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer, customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things, manager gives them what they want, and customer leaves smug. Not this manager, she always was my favorite. She gets to my till, listens to the, of course now calm and smiling woman, explain why she wanted the manager. 

**Woman:** So see? the basket was on the Clearance Aisle, but it rings up full price. If it's not on Clearance then it shouldn't have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there, and I need it, I expect to get it for the Clearance price.

**Manager:** (Smiling at her) We don't have a Clearance Aisle. That basket is in the home section with the other baskets. We have baskets on sale in that aisle, they have tags marking them. But this one isn't on sale. If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get one.

**Woman:** (smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes) NO! I will **NOT** go pick out another basket because of your mistakes!!! *I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance price!*

**Manager:** (still calm and smiling) Well, seeing as we still don't have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price. We aren't lowering it. If you want the basket it's ~$30-$40. Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase, you can pay for your other items and leave.

**Woman:** (screaming at this point) I'm never coming back here again, but I'm not done with this yet! This is ridiculous! I'm writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers! I will make sure you both lose your jobs! You can keep this shit, I'm not buying **ANY** of it!!

And with that she stormed off and out the door, leaving her son to mutter ""I'm so sorry..."" and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day. Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman. Nothing was going to happen. And nothing did. So much for not being done with it yet, we didn't hear a thing about about her after that. Her son did frequent the store though.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,205,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering.

Bunbury42,45,,39,1raduq,,179,"I work at a specialty retail store that sells a wide variety of one very specific item. We were running a coupon that offered people to buy 2 and get 2 free. A woman comes up to the register and presents her shopping basket, which contains 4 of the item and a few other things. First issue is that she has mixed in things that aren't part of the coupon. Technically I'm not supposed to allow that, but she was actually buying a worse deal than she could otherwise get. 

Me: ""Ma'am, the sizes you're getting aren't part of the coupon. I'm happy to adjust it for you, but it's actually a better deal to switch to [insert item info here]"" 

Woman: ""That's fine. I prefer these."" 

 Me: ""No problem at all"". 

It's strange to not want more for the exact same money, but if she's happy, that's fine. I get to the end of the transaction and inform her of her price. It's something around like $122.30. She hands me another coupon offering $15 off a purchase of $45 or more. Two red flags. First, we can't stack two kinds of coupons together. We can stack the same coupon in some circumstances, but different types we usually can't. Second, the coupon she gave me expired over a month ago.

insecure_shit_knob,30,,45,1r2plz,,174,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

TennisAndBeer,4,,41,1r63y6,,167,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues. 

When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous, technically she's in another department, but she's been there like 20 years so I'm sure she could have me fired. However, she was actually very mature about the whole thing. She apologized again and thanked me for the warning, saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadn't realized it.

meguriau,19,,28,1r5sy8,,165,"Hi TFR, I‚Äôm back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It‚Äôs been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn‚Äôt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That‚Äôs preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs the most I can do for you at this point in time. We‚Äôll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN‚ÄôT DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I‚Äôm terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you‚Äôd left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN‚ÄôT CALL. 

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry to hear of your husband‚Äôs ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let‚Äôs just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don‚Äôt need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that‚Äôs retail!

xVarekai,86,,35,1r3e2x,,163,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

  


",The tale of the ridiculous refund,177,talesFromRetail
Foliagus,31,,31,1r761t,,147,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.


Thanks for listening, TFR, you guys keep me sane.

**TL;DR:  I single-handidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air, before selling $9000 dollars of merchandise at 200% margin.**  ","Price-Matching, a mean lady, and a loss prevention incident. All in one night. T_T",178,talesFromRetail
MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,,21,1rep4z,,141,"A little backstory: I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school. I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes, however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy people...to be quite honest, I really enjoyed my time at this store...All my managers were great, it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool. I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked with...I guess it was kind of a utopian retail job.  

Now, a little more background about my particular job responsibilities...I was the stock room manager, I was the person that met the truck at the back door at 5am every tuesday, thursday, and saturday.  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipment....I knew how many boxes were coming, I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment.  In a nutshell, I knew the stock room backwards and forwards, knew what we had back there and what we didn't have because I unpacked it, organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers. There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor, and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they needed.

This particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times.  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me.  A little about our return policy...With a receipt and tags on the clothes, there was no time frame for returns.  You can buy something, put it in a closet for ten years, decide you don't want it and bring it back.  No problem.  If you don't have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes, you can always return them....things stay in the system basically indefinitely...but if you don't have the receipt, we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get.  If it says 50 bucks on the tag but comes up .25 cents, you get .25 cents back.  who knows what reduction stickers you've peeled off the tag.  So all this being said, here is my actual story...and I only remember this because in almost a year, this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this job.

Nice lady (NL) comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counter.

NL: Hi, MrDoctorSmartyPants!  How are you?  I haven't seen you the last few times I've been in here!

Me:  It has been a while, I'm doing pretty good...do you want to return these pants?  Do you have your receipt?

NL: I sure don't, but I've never taken the tags off of these as you can see, so I can still return them right?

Me: Yep you sure can, but, unfortunately if you don't have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as, and I'm sure you bought these a while back because I've never seen these in this store. (It should be noted the tag said $65 bucks for these particular pants)

NL:  Ok, that is fine, I've dealt with that before...but the tag says $65 dollars, and just because I don't have my receipt doesn't mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchase.

Me: I know you come here all the time, but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants, we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never there...and to be honest with you, in the time that I've worked here (since the store opened) I have never seen these pants, did you purchase them at another location?

NL:  Yes, but that doesn't matter because I paid $65 for them like a year and a half ago, and I've never worn them...but lets just return them and see what I can get back for them.

Me: ok, lets see...(at this point I scan the item and it comes up, no shit, at $2.45) Ok, it says $2.45.

NL: WHAT? That's robbery! That CAN'T be right.

Me: I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you, I explained our policy and you said you understood.  I've returned things without a receipt for you before....if I could give you more, I would...but I can't and I don't have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads.  

NL: Well this is absolutely unacceptable.  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost me....I know the policy but this is a little different...i paid a lot for these pants...this should be an exception!  I want to see a manager!

Me: Ma'am, I am the stock manager, I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants before...I'm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you, but I can't.  Honestly, this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy exists.

NL: Can't you just go look to make sure?  

Me: Sure, I'll do that for you.  (at this point i go in the back and out the back door for 10 minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back)  Nope.  We don't have any.  what the computer shows is the best I can do.

NL: NO! I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER! LESLIE! WHERE IS SHE?

Me: She isn't here today, ma'am...I'm the only manager in the store.

NL:  Well call her!

Me: I don't have her home number and I'm not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue.  I'm not making you return the pants, I'm not forcing you to take this money....you can keep the pants.

NL:  This is so stupid...I can't believe you're treating me like this! I come in here all the time! You should make exceptions!  Just give me my money and I'll be on my way...I don't want these stupid pants.

Me: Ok, Ma'am...here you go $2.45.  I'm really sorry for your inconvenience, have a nice day.

NL:  Yeah, you ruined this nice day! Wait until I talk to your manager!

I actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about something....the lady walked up and said hello, was cordial, and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior.  Sorry if this is so long, it wasn't even that bad...it just stuck out in my mind.

TL;DR: Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance, thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine.","Woman understands store return policy, refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance.",162,talesFromRetail
prettehkitteh,24,,32,1rcsdq,,138,"Wall of Text coming! 'tis the season, and I'm feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they don't need. I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier, so I never really experienced Black Friday - except one year, when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side. I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning. For some reason, the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at 5am. I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout, and we had special areas where the really popular/discounted toys were set up the day before, so I pretty much had no idea where anything was.

We didn't get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon, but people were lined up, and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early. I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside. I was immediately flooded with shouted questions:

""WHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOS?!""
""WHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SON!!""
""I NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTION?!""

I did my best to stutter answers out as people didn't even stop moving for me to answer. I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos (TMEs from now on) were because everyone wanted one. I could not believe how many people wanted one. I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive, and after the initial rush for the first two hours, people started being a little more polite, though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on. That was when crazy beard came in.

CB was a grungy ex-confederate-looking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face. He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded, ""I need a TME."" 

Me: ""Of course sir, if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right, they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle, you can't miss them.""

CB: ""Are you sure there are any left?""

Me: ""I haven't been back there in a little while, so unfortunately I don't know, I'm sorry.""

He waved a hand at me and scurried off. I thought that was the end of it. A minute later, he scurried back, visibly a lot more agitated.

CB: ""There were no TMEs!""

Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we did have some this mor--""

CB: ""How could you not have any TMEs?! You must have more in the back, I need one!""

I knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before - there was no backstock. I tried to explain this to CB as he started shaking.

CB: ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEs!""

Me: (fishing for anything to get this guy off my back) ""I-I'm sorry sir, there's not much I can do. If you had gotten here earlier--"" (big mistake)

CB: ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN I GET HERE, YOU'RE A FUCKING TOY STORE, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES?! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER!""

Those magic words. I was shaking now (I don't handle anger very well) and was relieved to get some help. I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom. CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his world-ending problem, but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder. We waited. I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers, so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CB.

Five minutes passed. I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom, trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers. CB wasn't amused, so I just kept standing there, shuffling my feet. I couldn't leave the guy, so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing. Another five minutes passed.

CB: ""What the fuck is taking him so long?""

Me: ""I don't know, I'm so sorry, I can go look for a manager if you want.""

CB: ""You're staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up, I know a cop out when I hear one.""

Me: ""I'm not trying to abandon you sir, I want to help--""

CB: ""You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HEAR ME?""

I was on the verge of crying at this point. I picked up the phone for a third time, trembling, trying to take a breath so I didn't start crying over the intercom - when the lead manager Tim finally showed up, out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly. CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim, who was 6'3"", built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long, braided black beard. Tim, who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees, asked ME what the problem was, which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitless.

Me: ""We're out of TMEs, and he really would like one.""

CB: ""That's RIGHT. I have a problem with the fact that--""

Tim: ""Just a moment, sir. Prettehkitteh, thank you, you can go back to the front.""

I scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didn't have TMEs, we didn't have TMEs. I watched as CB's anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little, to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tim's best gentle giant voice. Within two minutes, Tim smiled and pointed out the door. CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out. 

Tim came over to me, gave me a big hug, and told me to go take a breather in the back room. The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively, and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand.

Techsupportvictim,9,,43,1ragwd,,139,"Another tale (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1raduq/yesterday_i_was_fussed_at_for_not_accepting_an/) reminded me of this jem

When I was working big box ish books and more, I would get folks demanding we 'override' coupons all the time. And I was the manager. Old coupons, coupons they were clearly trying to double up etc. Thing was we had no override. It was all off bar codes and your reward card. Once something was 'past its sell by' forget it.

I had one day where we had this 'bounce back' redeeming. It was right after holidays and it was a 50% off the REGULAR price of one hardcover book. Art books excluded (being near a high end area we had some crazy expensive titles we basically sold at cost). 

All day folks are trying to stack it on NYT titles, use it on movies so on and so on. I'm down to my last hour and I'm just tired of it. I've already kicked out four folks for calling lawsuit (price company policy we stop all transactions at that point), with four 'I'm going to get you fired' rants. We have to document in detail all customer issues so I had paperwork on all four of them and the other yelling customers. Thankfully for every yelling customer there were several that just shrugged it off as their failure to read.

So I'm in the back, not actually the floor manager that hour, helping the stock room guys pull up their sold today lists to see what needs to go on the restock carts. A call comes back that our FM is with a customer and there's a guy yelling he wants the manager. Sure I'll come out. 

Guy wants to use the coupon on an art book. He's been told no, they are excluded. He's yelling that the cashier can and will take it etc. I cut in and introduce myself as the manager. He goes through his rant again. I explain that it's all programmed into our software and no we can't. He gives that manual override line. With some swear words tossed in. And some 'if that stupid cashier' comments

I'm done. I really want to hulk out on the guy. But I don't. I'm not sure how I kept my cool but I did. The rest of the convo goes something like: 

Me: so vacation or do you have a home here too

Him: excuse me?

Me: I said are you on vacation or do you keep a home here as well as (city our home office is in)

Him: I live here, why the bleeping bleep would I live there

Me: because the only way you can say what our system can and can't do is if you helped right it and those staff all work at the home office. 

Me (rubbing it in) and as a member of the home office you are fully aware that all employee purchases must be rung up by a manager and employees are not allowed to avail themselves of a reward card or the coupons issued in that program. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to report these violations and your harassment of my staff to HR. 

Me: (still rolling with it) if you would like to purchase this book I will ring you up for the employee discount of 10% for art department titles. What was your employee number? 

At which point he walked out without saying a word. And no I didn't think he was an employee I just said it to shut him up and make him hopefully see what a fool he was acting by telling us how our stuff runs. 

Never saw him again, never heard anything about him calling and complaining. Although our camera system has audio and our home office can and does remotely capture all footage to keep us honest. My district manager apparently saw that particular moment and was quite amused. 

TLDR: random customer tries to school us on our point of sale systems, I demanded his employee number to properly ring him up. ",What's your employee number again?,182,talesFromRetail

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16. ¬†Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure. ¬†He wants desperately to be cool. He‚Äôs got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid ‚Ä¶

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid‚Äôs church bow tie and his wife‚Äôs apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I‚Äôm bagging groceries. It‚Äôs Labor Day, so I‚Äôm constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

‚ÄúHey, are you unmined?‚Äù

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She‚Äôs my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and ‚Äúyeah‚Äù is all I can manage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I‚Äôve known since elementary school.
‚ÄúYou working all day today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBummer. We‚Äôre having a pool party. You could have come.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I‚Äôm here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I‚Äôm totally scared of talking to girls.

‚ÄúI wish I could. I hope you‚Äôre having a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe we can do something next week.‚Äù Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

‚ÄúTotally. You have a pen?‚Äù

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I‚Äôm both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy‚Äôs Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

‚ÄúCall me. We‚Äôll set something up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, thanks!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you later!‚Äù She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it‚Äôs all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I‚Äôm feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I‚Äôm so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom‚Äôs stash (don‚Äôt do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she‚Äôs just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bummed. This went by took quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has,‚Äù I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR ‚Ä¶ next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I‚Äôd give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it‚Äôs indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

littlewoolie,8,,29,1r6hc9,,129,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,158,talesFromRetail
aturquoiseseashell,12,,24,1rg9do,,129,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch‚Ä¶""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am‚Ä¶"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

At this store,  there are TONS of tiny little items (earrings, bracelets ect.)

You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever. This pair of kids walk in, one looks 15, the other maybe 11, and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone. Well, manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM. I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security. Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream!!  He stops her, calls her mom, who comes in SCREAMING at her (in perfect english) and makes her spit out those earrings. We only got 3 out of 4 back. She can keep the last one.

AAEmmerson,23,,20,1ra3qv,,112,"You all seemed to really like my [Bacon sandwich](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r7jes/thrown_out_of_the_airport_all_for_a_bacon_sandwich/) post so much. I thought I'd tell another story from the airport coffee shop.

This one is more asshole manager than customer.

In our little unit there was very few places to actually store things, so most of our stuff was stored in the bowels of the airport. To get it up into the behind security bit of the airport was a real pain.

We had store guys who'd pack a cage of goods, like the big tall ones you'd see in a supermarket, but then we had to take them into a separate room, with airport security, and unpack all the boxes onto a big scanner, and then repack the cage. Often single handedly running back and forth to either end.

It's a royal pain in the butt, and even worse that 99% of the security guards shrugged and said not my job if something was about to fall off or break. I don't blame them, was just a pain. 

Well one day to do this job, when I start unpacking the cage I notice that there's a puddle of milk underneath. (For the record our milk came in boxes, with a huge plastic bladder inside), so obviously it was leaking, which in itself was not hugely unusual, you'd just grab the mop in there and clean it up. 

So I put them on the belt and send them through, when finally they get to the other side I lift them off, as  i do so, the bottom of the boxes opens, and about 40litres of milk gushes out, all over me, and the floor. I get absolutely soaked. 

I have to keep packing the trolley though, because some of the stuff is frozen and you have to do it in quick time. Except the second box of milk does pretty much the same again, as soon as it touches the cage, it explodes over the floor. 

At this point, i'd been working since 4am, it was 1 pm, i'd had no breakfast, a non stop morning, and was tired and emotional and somewhat covered in 80 litres of milk,

Under threat of death from security, I was told I had to clear it all up, because yeah milk smells. So I traipsed the cage upstairs and to my manager (a different supervisor to Bacon sandwich man) who's just finishing off his break (after an hour working).

I ask him for an extra pair of hands to get the whole thing cleared up because quite frankly it was going to take me for ever. He stands up, and laughs in my face, and walks off shouting ""get a mop bucket and do it yourself"" - It really did take all my powers of self control not to rugby tackle him and punch his head in, but I'm honestly close to rage tears with being so tired drenched. 

I gather my thoughts and go do the job, as unpleasant and as long as it took me, when I get back, and ask for my meal voucher for my break, he tells me I used it all up cleaning up the milk, It's only when I stand up face to face with him (i'm at least 6'3 to his 5'7) and remind him of my legal rights to a break that he backs down.

Needless to say I refused to ever work with him again, and he quickly got transferred to another shop in the airport. That was the worst day of my retail life I think. ",Why I nearly cried over spilled milk,132,talesFromRetail
rumplesplitskin,25,,13,1re4w8,,118,"We had a power cut at the station the other night, thankfully the only customers in the shop were just in buying a few grocery items. Nobody was on the forecourt getting fuel at the time. The only power we had was the emergency battery back up that powers the lights, nothing else no tills, pumps or computer. Even the main door had to be physically pulled open to let people out, it was obvious to anyone with a IQ over that of a cabbage that we were not open for business.

Those customers that were in at the time understood that because of the outage we could not process and credit/debit cards and worse still we could not open the tills to give change. It was a pain in the arse but we managed to give change by breaking in to the staff tea kitty so we got by without having to refuse any sales.

Then the last in the line a 18ish old guy decided that he needed petrol. This following is how that conversation went..

ME : Ok, your total comes to ¬£2.56. Due to the power cut we can't open the tills so if you have close to the correct amount in cash that would be a help.

PP(petrol pr*ck) I only have some pound coins is that ok ?

ME : Yeah, that's fine. We'll just call the total ¬£2.50 and i hand him a 50p coin back.

PP : Thanks, i'll hand in the 6p next time ok ?

ME : Naw, that's ok. Don't worry about it.

PP : Thanks, bye.

Just as my cashier is pulling the door open for him he stops and turns back to me.

PP : Oh i think i better get some petrol for the morning.

ME : Sorry, but we have no way to sell you fuel. Everything including the tills is out so i can't take payments.

In hindsight i should have worded this differently but it was late and i was just wanted him out of the shop so we could close early and get on with documenting tonight's outage for the next shift in the morning.

PP : Then i'll just leave you the cash and you can ring it up when the power comes back on.

ME : Sorry but i can't do that.

PP : (cuts me off) But i NEED petrol, you'll just have to figure something out.

He then storms out to the pumps where he's parked and lifts the nozzle expecting the petrol to flow. I'm looking at my cashier asking him did that really just happen ? After a good ten seconds or so with the guy waiting out there he waves his arms to get my attention and shouts at me to ""turn the fucking pump on!""

I grab the padlocks that we use to lock the pumps overnight with and head out to let this idiot know that he's not getting petrol from us tonight. As i'm walking over to him he's still standing there with the nozzle in his car looking at me like i'm the idiot.

ME : We have a power cut. We have no power to turn the pumps on.

PP : Don't lie to me, your lights are on. you have power, you just want to get home don't you ?

ME : Yes i do want to get home but i still can't give you any petrol without electricity to power the pumps. Those are emergency battery lights.

PP : I NEED petrol, what are you going to do ? i'm not leaving until i get my petrol.

ME : (really pissed off now) Well what i'm going to do i lock these pumps, close the shutters and then go home.

PP : WHAT ? You can't talk to me like that i'm a customer.

ME : No, you're a f**king idiot. now leave before i call the police to have you removed.

Normally i would never talk this way to any of our customers but this guy's attitude and pure dumbness just hit a nerve with me.

PP : Fuck you, you fat munt.

ME : Yeah ok, just leave.

PP : I want to talk to your manager, you're getting fired!

ME : I am the manager and i'm telling you to leave the premises before i call the police.

He drops the nozzle on the ground and looks at me as if to say pick that up bitch!

ME : Really ? What are you a child in a man's body ? Grow up.

PP : F**k you.

He gets into his car and drives off but not before leaving a parting shot of calling me a fat cow. Ok, i was a little taken back by this as i'm a 6.2"" hairy arsed dude with three day old stubble but still a cow ? that really hurt :)

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it, he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldn't figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me.  I ignored him and finished the drink.  As I handed it back, he looked at it, told me anybody could make a martini, and slapped 36 cent on the counter.  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached, turned back around and said ""I think I tipped you to fn much.  I can make my own gd martini next time.  Enjoy your minimum wage.""  Okay.  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing I'd said the entire time was ""What would you like to drink?""  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness, but I brushed it off; just another night at the bar right?

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Queue Asshole-Negger. Let's call him A.N. for short. 
A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking.""

Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD (manager on duty) and I were cleaning up around the store. Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being.   

For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine; I know, somehow, that this is going to be bad. 

DB: ‚ÄúI bought this dress the other day (whips out cotton dress) and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back. Can I exchange it?‚Äù

Me: (Hoping this is easier than I first thought) ‚ÄúOf course, let‚Äôs see if we still have another in the same size!‚Äù(Extra small petite)

We did not. 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry; it doesn‚Äôt look like we have another in the same color and size. We can exchange it for a different color, or I can refund you back your money for it, no problem!‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo, I want to wear THIS one!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI can look it up and see if another store has it if you want. We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there. We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer, but if there is a low inventory, there‚Äôs no guarantee you will get t unfortunately. The inventory is about 24 hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shown.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo. That is unacceptable. I want this one! Can‚Äôt you just sew a new button on it?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt have spare buttons, but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesn‚Äôt look off balance if you like.‚Äù (Mind you the button is TINY. About half the size of a dime. It‚Äôs really not that big of an issue.)

Now, this where things start to go downhill. 

DB: ‚ÄúWhat will you do with the dress if I return it?‚Äù  
Honesty, to me,  is the best policy, but had I known how this was going to go down, I probably would have just lied to this person.

Me: ‚ÄúMost likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped out.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúThen rip a button off another dress and sew it to this one!‚Äù

I am VERY taken aback by this.  She wants me‚Ä¶.to destroy‚Ä¶. No way! Just. No. 

Me: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, I cannot destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúWHAT?! You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it, what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent out?!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWell, that dress is now YOURS since you bought it. You can do with it what you will, and if you return it, then it becomes the property of the company again,  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor. The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúI RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS! YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANT!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI am not going to destroy company property. You can return the dress or I can find one at another store. Those are your options. I am not risking my job by destroying company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúTHAT IS BULL SHIT! YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! I RAN A BUSINESS! I KNOW! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAlright, MOD (who has been listening the whole time) this client would like to speak with you.‚Äù

The MOD comes over and I walk away, continue to tidy up the store and do my job. Then I see the MOD take the client‚Äôs dress‚Ä¶. And the dress on the floor‚Ä¶. I'm thinking that she CAN'T POSSIBLY be doing what I think...Yes, the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DB‚Äôs dress. 

Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on. During the entire time DB won‚Äôt stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy, etc etc etc.  She then turns to me again and tells me ‚ÄúLosing your job over making a customer happy? That is SUCH bullshit! I don‚Äôt know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPY.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond, it will be nasty. 
DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes over.

MOD: ‚ÄúMystic-Spiral, I‚Äôm sorry that I went over your head and did that. I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didn‚Äôt want a scene.‚Äù 

I REALLY loved that MOD, she was like another mom to me, but I absolutely could not respond to her. I don‚Äôt think I said a word for the rest of the evening. The whole thing boils my blood even now. 

So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave, you can get someone to destroy company property just so you don‚Äôt have to fork over a few cents for a replacement button at a fabric store.

Sapphires13,19,,22,1r8o2i,,95,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""   
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""   
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""   
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""   
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""   
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""   

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""   
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""   
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""    
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""    
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""   
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]    
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""    
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""   
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""    
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",117,talesFromRetail

Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

**TL;DR - Caught a guy from my HS stealing; asked me if we got him good, showed him his theft video. Year later same dude busted robbing a bank.**

KroipyBill,11,,39,1rhynu,,125,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

thompsontoons_art,16,,15,1r9l9k,,95,"Customer walks up to me just as I'm about to go on my late afternoon lunch break. She says she's there to pick up an order for [X person name: We'll call her Fuddle Duddle], and it should be a couple of bedskirts. She received a call that the order was in. Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse. I go to our holds area to find the order...

...there's no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me. I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer. 

""Ma'am, you said your name is Fuddle Duddle? I don't see any orders out back with that name attached.""

""Well, no. My name is Sue. Fuddle is my friend; I'm in the area, so she asked me to pick up her order for her.""

The next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up. Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few large-ish purchases. Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure she'd paid for the order being shipped to the store, and it just needed to be picked up. I look through our log book listing paid for pick-up orders, and there was no listing of Fuddle's name in the book. I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for; if this was the case, our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after 48hrs. Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts. I tried looking up Ms. Duddle's customer information in our register and through our catalog system, and I found no purchase records at all. 

""Well, that can't be right,"" Sue said, ""We were here in the store. We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff. We were here for hours. You must have a record."" I informed her that their purchases would be in our records, but they wouldn't be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them. Since their names didn't come up in our profile search, I figured they'd opted out of having a profile created. 

Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information. Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle. I inquire what style bedskirt it was that she'd ordered for pick up, and she said she couldn't really describe it. (She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store, but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasn't available in store at the time.) Supposedly it was a plain tailored style, and she had a receipt for the item at home... but she wasn't at home that very moment, so she couldn't give me the information on the receipt. She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt, but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order... which she said is, ""...a queen sized dust ruffle in white... or maybe it was two twins."" She couldn't even remember what she ordered. I described a couple of the styles to her, and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely. I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone else's name, and she said no... but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up. So... we had a third person involved in this order. I took down Fuddle's phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce, who was originally called and notified about the order, and I told her we'd give her a call once we sort the issue out.

Sue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddle's order (Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine, which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go). Sue looks at me saying, ""So, if you eventually find this bedskirt, you'll have to mail it to us for free, right? I don't want to drive another 60 miles to come pick it up, and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow it's not."" I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them. Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leave.

Meanwhile, my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddle's original purchase... which has a queen sized bedskirt on it. ""She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store, and they left with her."" What could she have possibly ordered? We went back to the holds area. There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased... under Fuddle's neighbor Pierce's name and contact phone number... and it was unpaid for. I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadn't pulled out of the parking lot yet. They were gone. My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store. We're just hoping things will work out so we don't have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information. The neighbor does get a hold of Sue, she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friend.

**TL:** Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend. Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we can't track down the order that's supposed to be in store. The actual order wasn't a bedskirt, it wasn't paid for, and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer.

GrimGuy,29,,18,1r0zg2,,93,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

Fixer_,14,,20,1r8gem,,89,"**Background:**I work at a popular electronics/appliance store as a Computer &amp; Tablets Sales Consultant. I love my job. However, we get our fair share of nasty customers! 

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

At this point i offer to go get my supervisor, and the man accepts. I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown. At this point I don't interact with the customer again. Apparently, my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said. He (Being the awesome supervisor he is) refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price, saying ""Sir, it's mid November, we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on display.

According to my Sup, the man said nothing but ""I'll be back."" and walked out of the store. 

I'm not sure when he will be back, but I hope he isn't as big of an asshole next time!","""I'll be back!""",109,talesFromRetail
kemmer,37,,22,1rbkuk,,93,"Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino. I've worked at several other retail jobs since then, and the casino job is easily the worst I've ever had. The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money, and they took out that anger and frustration on us. Some stories...

**Orientation:**

Everyone that was starting work in the casino that week, no matter the job or department, took part in the same orientation. It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms, but it ended in a tour of the whole property. We saw the high roller suites, the ballrooms, all the restaurants, etc. While touring the steakhouse (the most expensive restaurant), the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available. He pulled out a bottle of one (I don't remember what it was now, probably Cristal or something like that), and told us how lucky we were to see it up close, because *none of us would ever be able to afford it*. It's been 7 years since I had that job, and the memory of that STILL pisses me off. I was 17 years old, that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make. Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers, there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting. It's been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu. Just for my own satisfication, you know? I should have known then this job was gonna suck.

**Counting:**

I'm not gonna front, I'm pretty bad at math. I'm fairly intellegent otherwise, graduated college with a 3.85 GPA, but I've just never been able to wrap my head around numbers. One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink. The order was something like $12.08. He handed me $13, I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him 92 cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter. I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now. It honesly couldn't have been more than 3 seconds that I hesitated, but in that time he started screaming, literally screaming, at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been. But he couldn't stop there, oh no, he had to *call his wife over* so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were. ""Can you believe it?! How can they hire people this dumb?!"" I had figured out his change in the meantime, handed it to him, turned around and sobbed over the chili. The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgust.

**Suicide:**

My most memorable day working at the casino, and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever. This place was essentially like Disneyland, in that there was a whole underground world for the employees. We had our own stores, our own bank, our own cafeteria, etc. To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli, we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing. The parking garage was right outside the deli doors. One day I was walking back to work after my break, when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage. I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground, mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids. I couldn't tell what was going on, but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli. Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage. They had already removed the body, but I got to see the remnants. The image of that will forever stick in my brain.

Those are my ""best"" stories, but that doesn't even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car, the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company, or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families (neither knew of the other). I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time. Those cookies were damn good.

TL;DR: Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth.

""well could it be in back?""
""No, but, I can go look up on our PC and see if we even have it in stock""

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

I tell her

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

I know it's not in back, it's not got a home and it's not even being carried at our stores. I look anyways and it's not there. I go back to her and explain that it's not in back and not carried at this store. I know what's coming up next, she sighs and tells me ""is there a manager around I can talk too?""

I tell her the Team Leader has gone home, and I'll have to call for a Manager to come and that would take a while since they are in a meeting. She tells me ""well, I just want an explanation from a manager. I guess I won't get this movie, but, I won't leave until I have a better explanation then 'we don't have it'. I know you do have it because the ad I read it and they wouldn't lie"".

I reluctantly call a manager. About 30 mins afterwards Ted the Store Manager comes around. I hate Ted and so does everyone else. Ted is arrogant and unreasonable and runs the store with an iron fist. He comes up to me, and says a flat ""What do you want?"" I explain the issue and then the lady asks why it's not in stock.

Ted looks at her, and then looks at the PC and then looks at me. 

""I'm sorry ma'am we do not carry this movie at all. Perhaps i could find you another movie. There is no other reason. We can not order X we do not even carry the movie.""

""Would another X carry it or was it just this store that's slow?""

""no. If it's not on our database that means we do not carry it""

Last Saturday(we get lots of clueless DIYers on the weekend) a lady came in needing some molding cut to length.  This lady was so hot that I wanted to avoid looking like I'm showing her special treatment (most guys are guilty of this).. 
She was in her late 20's(I'm 21).  She was about 6'0"" had gorgeous blond hair, extremely dark brown eyes, and the ass was fat.  The only problem was she had these Gary Busey eyes.  She was clearly not normal.  She somehow seemed like the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" type.  The kind that will laugh manically at everything with eyes *really* wide open.  I did everything I could to just stay professional.
Eventually she finds the molding she wants and asks me to rip it........meaning to cut it lengthwise.  It's called ""quarter round"" you might have some in the room your sitting in right now http://www.paramount-floors.com/i/Quarter_Round_White_Oak_1.jpg this means to cut that piece into a 45 degree prism. ""You've got to be shitting me"" I thought.  ""Surely she's just trying to be funny, or fuck with me"".  She just stared back with her crazy Gary Busey eyes.  After 5 seconds of silence, I look up chuckling and say ""you know I really can't do that, right?""  She stands right up against me, chest now pressed on the back of my arm, ""gosh, this piece of molding, ripped, would be perfect for my project..""
""This bitch is crazy"" I thought"".  Cutting a piece of wood that tiny by hand will look ridiculous, no matter how hard I try. After quite some time of telling her that it will look like crap, she still insists.  So I get a Drimmel  http://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Cordless-8300-01-Dremel-Multi-Max-12V-Oscillating-Tool.jpg and get to it, very, very slowly. 
It takes me about 40 minutes to rip the (2) 10.5 foot pieces of molding, and it still looks like it was cut by a drunken sailor.  I give them to her with a smile and a ""no problem"".  She thanks me and talks with me for about 10 minutes.  This lady is talking like she's known me for years, and it's making me a little uncomfortable.  She's hot, but a serious nutcase.. She isn't *just* being friendly and I'm not sure what she's getting at.
When she leaves, I see her pick up my card, and wink.  
I get a picture message from an unknown number that night.  It reads ""heyyy Luca20, that quarter round worked out really well!""  With a picture of her, showing a*lot* more chest, splintery jagged molding in the background.

ExcerptMusic,18,,14,1rahbf,,89," I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues. Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it. However, there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults.

 Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phone.

Keep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes. I am being as nice as possible on the outside.

I had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone. I knew it wasn't going to be fun to figure out because he had on the ""fuck you"" face and looked to be in the ""ignorant with technology"" age range. He presented me with 3 problems

1. My alarm doesn't alert me in the morning and I need it for work.

2. The outside keys don't lock so the phone turns the speaker on.

3. The battery runs out when I unplug it at night.

He then followed by ""I bought this phone 30 days ago and want to return it"" and ""I've been with this company for 10 years""

 Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the ""I've been shopping here for X amount of years""... This company doesn't care about you personally.. they just don't. This isn't some mom &amp; pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business. This is a multi-BILLION dollar company. They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those 10 years, because I guarantee this isn't your first time complaining. 

 So you bought the phone 30 days ago? Sorry you can't return it. There is a 14 day return policy on phones company wide. This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors (which doesn't happen). We could also get the manufacturer to replace it (if there is actually a problem with it). There was no problem with the phone so there is 100% nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone. So I check it out and explain to him what is going on.

 The alarm.. First off, his alarm was off. He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesn't work. I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdays(I did this for him). He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off 5 minutes after it was supposed to. I tested the alarm feature about 15 times. No issues. If it happened every time like he said, I would have seen it at least once. Even after telling him that the alarm was off, he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically. No. It wasn't. Next issue.

 The outside keys wouldn't lock. Ok. This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys. He also has a horizontal belt carrier. He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him, he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didn't do that. I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling. You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call. After talking more with him, I figured out why his old phone didn't have that issue. He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone. Next issue.

 The battery runs out at night. This one is just stupid... He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night, he unplugs it and leaves it open. The phone also has the screen timeout disabled. So at night, he unplugs the phone at 100%, leaves it open fully lit, and goes to bed. Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead. He must sleep with the lights on or something, I don't know. I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in (even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years). A problem with battery capacity in 2 years isn't going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because ""the phone dies at night"".

 Now that i've fixed his issues, he says that he will try it out but he doesn't expect it to work because it was the phone. 

 Sorry guy, it wasn't the phone. It was user error through and through. Don't blame technology for your mishaps. Technology isn't some black magic. 90% of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read. If the alarm says ""OFF"" then the alarm is off. It's that simple. 

 As much as I hate these people, I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues. It's almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door. I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it. Seriously, those are the best customers ever..

TL;DR- User error accounts for most errors.

LossPreventionSucks,24,,23,1rfcsa,,83,"This is my first time posting here, but I'll just warn you this can get a bit winded.  I've yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy, as my manager mentioned I should ""keep quiet"" about the whole ordeal.


Now... I work for a popular gaming store chain.  I'm sure you can guess which one.  I've heard the horror stories, however I've had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention Manager.

To start the day off, I had to open.  I went in about 15 minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch.  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in.  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didn't go over hours and he was totally fine with that.  Anyway... 2 minutes after walking through the door, a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling ""I'M HERE! LET ME IN!""  I ignore them for the first 5 minutes (I mean, gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and it's almost 2 hours before open).  I walk up to them and inform them we open at 10.  The man quickly snaps ""Bullshit! We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release!"".  So I texted my manager and, sure enough, he said ""Absolutely not.  If they're picking a system up, let them in, though.""  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with ""No, I want to return this stuff"" holding up at least $400 worth of XBox games and a system.  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down.  He finally agreed and left only to call every 2 minutes or so and ask if we were open, yet... For the next hour and a half.  Now, because this guy was so persistent, I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didn't have to wait for the 20 minute timer to go up.  I figured he'd come back right away.  That was my first mistake.  He never did come back and, due to us being so busy and me being the only one there, I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bit.


On to the second half... I was there alone all morning.  I had several people asking for systems, which require me to go through a locked door, through a hallway, and into another locked door to get to.  I have to do this for each system whether or not 3-4 people in line are waiting for a system.  This gives 5-10 minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store.  So what did I do?  I propped the first door open.  Mistake number two.


After a bit, my part-timer came in.  45 minutes after opening (I repeat, we were open for 45 whole minutes, at this point... 30 of which I had spent alone with nearly 30 customers in the store picking up systems)... In walks our Loss Prevention guy.  I didn't know he was Loss Prevention, though... No... He instantly walks in, starts yelling at my part-timer about the door, and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there.  Still no introduction, the following commenced:

FatLossPreventionMan:  ""Why the hell is the back door open?""

Me:  ""Can I help you?""

FatLP:  ""IS YOUR SAFE OPEN?  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING"" (remember, there's multiple people in the store at this point, several in line)

Me: *oh fuck*  ... stutter... stutter...""Yeah, there was an incident this morning where I had a return, but he never showed up.  I also needed to add change to the register""

FatLP: ""You can't do this.  Are you the manager?""

Me: ""No, may I ask who you are?""

FatLP: *beaming* ""I'm Dave.  I'm here to audit and help with customers"".

Me:  ""Okay.  Yeah, I messed up.  It's been a hectic morning.""

After this exchange, he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store.  Mind you... I'm not the manager.  I'm not even assistant manager.  I'm a store worker who gets paid 50 cents more than minimum wage with manager duties.  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs 7 feet in the air, saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them (I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how).  He then answered phones with just ""Hi, this is Dave"".  No greeting, nothing... Just... Dave.  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didn't know the answer... These people then called back so they could complain to me.


At this point, he had yelled at my coworker and I, loomed over us, and degraded us so badly that I was near tears.  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how ""pathetic"" this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing.  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I.  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on, giving no personal space.  The customer asks ""Are you okay?"" and Dave butts in ""She's fine... Do you want the GPG?"".  I said nothing... I was beaten and I couldn't do anything.  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about 90 different things that I had done that was a terminable offense.  I was afraid if I said anything more, that I would be done... And I need this job.  


Anyway... There's a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share (mostly from corporate), but this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.


TL;DR:  Shitty customers banging on the door.  I screw up.

I'm a rather short (5'3""), and slim girl, so I definitely do not give off a ""strong"" vibe (I am much more so than most people think though, that type of job definitely can keep you in shape).

 Most of the time, it's older customers who seem almost worried for me, as in a ""are you sure that's not too heavy for you?"" when I'm clearing off a table. Yes, I can, otherwise I would not be carrying all of this, that would be silly. I appreciate the concern, but no need to make comments.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

One of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while I'm lifting it, and says ""You shouldn't do that! You're a girl! You're not nearly strong enough to do that!""

Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

*She went and grabbed one of our reusable bags*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

ME: ""..kay. Your total is [total]."" *she pays me in cash*

I had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change, but I restrained myself!

HER: ""That cashier is so nasty."" *leaves*

After closing, I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people ""oh you don't mind do you?"" as she pushed past, yelled at the cashier for ""blinding her"" with the red scanner light, and tried to get her to give her a discount without a coupon.

Needless to say, we were not sad to see her go.

Maloth_Warblade,6,,16,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,14,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

HeloRising,16,,17,1ra3ti,,65,"Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it, I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one I'd forgotten.

This was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day. Alas, the day was not to remain so. A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves. She smiled and I greeted her, asked her if she was looking for anything in particular, she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that. 

About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried. 

(Note the punctuation in her statement is very. very. deliberate.)

""Umm...I'm trying to decide on one of these It's for my daughter she's graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldn't have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I don't know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe that's a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe they'd go well in her new place but I don't know for sure what it looks like because it's all the way out past the freeway and--""

This goes on for quite some time. I'm overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything she's saying because it's coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesn't seem to want to slow down. I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned. After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesn't intend to stop. Like ever. 

At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security. This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stay-at-home moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasn't unheard of and it was starting to look like she'd either taken too much or too little of something strong.

By now she'd begun almost a full-blown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast. Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly. Also she'd stopped focusing on me, she was no longer looking directly at me anymore. She had this kind of ""thousand yard stare"" going on. 

Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting. Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point, spewing molten crazy on everything around her.

Just before the ten minute mark, she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out. We were watching a grown human being have a full-blown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shop...and we hadn't the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it. She'd gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice, unreasonably hot coworker told the security guard:

""A customer is having a nervous breakdown, what's the policy on that?"" 

It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression you'd expect on people's faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP; profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascination.

Eventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to just...staring off into space with her mouth slightly open. We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact, who I assume was her husband. He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store. He didn't explain what was going on, just thanked us for calling him and left with her. I never did see her again after that.

Part of me is amazed I'd forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it. Not as funny as the other two but still entertaining in its own way.","""A customer is having a nervous breakdown, what's the policy on that?""",82,talesFromRetail

We stare at her blankly and offer no response, giving her the opportunity she so desperately needed to vent (it was quite apparent that she lacks rational people in her life).  When she finishes I ask her if she would instead prefer to take the cable, although more expensive, made by her phone's manufacturer.

TaterSaladDelta,19,,25,1rcu4v,,64,"  So my brother manages a seasonal fireworks tent every year. He lets me work there and gives me a small cut of his final check. I usually just clean up/ring up the occasional customer. More often than not I'm just hanging out. This year we were pretty busy and the tent was packed. It was a few nights before the fourth of July and we were going nuts trying to keep up.

  That's when I saw him. **Bubby**. He looked like a normal guy, late 50's, hispanic, balding slightly. But he was far from normal. He wandered in with his oversized flannel and adidas slip-ons and started scanning the big assortments. Like $200 big. He had a different handler every night, most likely family, that would translate for him. 

  He decided he wanted the biggest thing there and was waiting in line. I was on bag duty and as I handed out bags I would occasionally glance up at each customer. I would catch a glimpse of him every time, one spot closer, ready to seal my doom. He'd do this disturbing thing with his mouth, sort of like [this](http://youtu.be/AFbYU1xpR9Q?t=6s) and stare me down. I knew I was in his sights. I was marked. He had me targeted and I wasn't getting away. 

  The line was going slowly and he didn't like that. He would crane his head up to look at me and point to his assortment, he would snap at me and motion to ""come here"". He didn't speak english but he would say ""bubby bubby bubby"". I could hear him over the roar of the other customers, beckoning for me to assist him. I just tried to ignore it and let him get bored of trying to summon me. Then he was next. 

  *Oh Shit*

  Until that moment I didn't know his translators couldn't translate for shit. He slams the assortment down and points to it like an expectant toddler. He then said something in English.

""Free for me?""

  **damnit**

  Like most customers that don't speak English, he had seen the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE banner with (selected items only) in small print and wanted his free fireworks. We tried to explain to him that he needs to buy a product marked for the deal but he wasn't having it. His eyes narrowed and his weird lip thing intensified. He pointed to the assortment again and his translator tried to help. I don't know what she said but he went into a rage so glorious I almost laughed right at him. 

  He started yelling ""**BUBBY BUBBY BUBBY, FREE FOR ME**"" and I thought he was about to chew his own lips off. Eventually he calmed down and overpaid by about $20 for the assortment but he came back numerous times, piss drunk, and bought huge amounts of fireworks and every time he would pull *me* aside and spout ""bubby, bubby, bubby"" at me. Then demand his free fireworks.

So the first guy waves me towards him. He has a necklace in his hand and asked me if the symbol on it is a satanic symbol. I'm quite confused and just mutter ""uhhh, no"". He then tells me that ""Oh nonono, I'm no satanist, just askin', don't think that!""

""I was mugged...by a raven."" And looks exactly like someone who thinks of a terrifying thing that happened in the past. 


I just stood there in silence, not sure whether to laugh or to be worried. And hoping that he won't pay with his junk-money.


He obviously doesn't have anything to say to me anymore so I go somewhere else to tidy up a little bit.

""Are you able to organize some [verka] for me?"" 

I have no idea what he's talking about and ask him what that is.

For the Americans, a betting shop would be called a sportsbook over there, and here they're generally known for containing the... not so nice members of society.

Anyway, here's one story I can remember, and I apologise, I'm not a very talented writer.

So I'm working with my colleague at around 9pm (we shut at 10). The shop is empty which is a rare and pleasant surprise. A man walks in and asks for money to be loaded onto one of the gaming machines. These are machines where you can play virtual roulette, slots etc. and the customers can put their money in themselves or we can do it from behind the counter if they're paying by card. Now, due to strict gambling laws and company policy, if they pay by card their winnings have to be returned to them back onto their card. This is to prevent fraud. 

The man comes up to the counter and quite rudely says he wants ¬£50 on the machine. I take his card and inform him before processing the transaction that any winnings will be put back onto the card he paid with. He does not like this at all, raising his voice to me saying it‚Äôs his money and he wants it back in cash. I say that‚Äôs not possible as its policy. He grumbles for a bit but accepts and plays his game. Two minutes later he kicks the machine and I notice he‚Äôs lost his ¬£50. He comes back up to the counter and wants ¬£100 to be put on this time, I again inform him all winnings are to go back onto the card (I have to for every transaction). He loses it. He starts screaming and shouting at me that I never told him that before. I tell him I did and he previously argued with me about it, and my colleague was next to me at the time and also heard it. He goes on a rant about how I now need to pay him his LOST money back and he wants a refund. He gave me the ‚Äòultimatum‚Äô of refunding his ¬£50 or letting him pay by card and get his winnings back in cash. What the fuck? You want me to give you back money you gambled away and lost? He was shouting at me saying I stole his money, he‚Äôs kicking things and he‚Äôs just generally losing his shit. I had to call the police as he refused to leave, and they escorted him out. They laughed when I told them what happened.

Best part? He was wearing his branded work uniform which is a fairly upmarket supermarket, and I had his full name from his card. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs still been kicking off since I left.

I put in my two weeks notice at the big box pet retail store not long after I accepted a job as a teller at a local bank. I just wanted to share something that happened yesterday that was pretty much one of the most ridiculous things I've been asked. Not dramatic, just ridiculous.

So this older woman walks in the door and up to my register. She holds out her hand and says, ""Can you tell me what kind of treat this is?"" She's holding a single treat. No bag, no nothing. Just the treat. Coincidentally I had bought the same kind for my dog before, so I showed her exactly where they were. I made my way back to the register. 

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws).

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

raiseursails,28,,12,1r3a64,,63,"Hello! I work a corporate pet store for over a year and a half and I'm a lead cashier. Over the past year and a half, I had many things happened, that I still cringe to this day. But far worst was yesterday. It was a typical afternoon, and a little old woman comes up to my register holding a very squirming puppy and some dog food. W is for woman, M is for me:

W- Can I put the puppy on the belt for just a moment while I get my wallet out and pay?

M- Yea sure, I'll turn off the belt. 


Now at this moment, the cute puppy poops and pees all over my belt. Like diarrhea bad. 

M-Ma'am, it seems like your dog has had an accident on my belt. Right there is a 'oops station"" where you can find some paper towels and baggies. 

W- ITS NOT MY JOB TO CLEAN UP AFTER MY DOG! ITS YOUR JOB. YOU GET PAID FOR IT!

M- Ma'am, you are responsible for your own animal, as I am responsible for my own. 

W- NO! NO! ITS NOT MY JOB, I DON'T WANT THIS FOOD, I'M LEAVING. 

Then she left, in which I did have to clean up the mess all over my belt, which took forever and it still smells a little bit. Lovely. Can't wait till I have to go back to work tomorrow.

shadowmanwkp,12,,20,1r1q8g,,59,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around ‚Ç¨2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.

blarglznoflo,9,,9,1rbyqq,,62,"At our grocery store, we give out these little stickers for every $10 you spend, and when you get 20 you get a free plate/bowl from this cool set. It's a great deal for people who are there all the time and also need/want dishes. But it's caused me so many headaches thanks to dumb customers...

**""I shouldn't have to pay $200 for a plate!""**

No, you shouldn't. You can buy the plate for $6 right now if you want, or you can buy the groceries you normally buy every week and get it for free in like 2 weeks.

**""So if I don't take the stickers, I'm basically paying for the plates for the people who do!""**

...What? How does that even...No, you're paying for your groceries. Exactly the same as if we did not have this promotion going at all.

**""I'll never get anything out of it!""**

You just spent $250. I would hand you 25 stamps, enough to get a free plate right here, right now. But even after I explain that, you still refuse because you can't get a full set all at once from these stamps alone. Even though with how much you spend here weekly, you'd get a full set in a month.

This wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if my job doesn‚Äôt require me entering the back to get stuff to stock the front every 30-40 minutes.    

So Tuesday, trying to be a good employee and do my job, I knock to be let in to grab more stuff to do and this guy makes eye contact with me then waves his hand at me all ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and keeps working at his desk.  I‚Äôm fine if he ignore me cause some of the back room workers do but they pretend not to hear at least but him, oh him made eye contact to let me know that he were refusing to let me in.

On Tuesday, you made me cry and feel like shit.  

Because You, with the cushy job, getting paid $20-$30 an hour for essentially doing nothing but put tracking slips on books, decided to refuse to let me, who gets paid minimum wage, to get my work done. Work, that without us doing, you will have to be demoted to doing.

People who has nicely asked their supervisor for a key and then nicely asked for a follow up less than a week ago but have yet to get one.    

People who appreciatively say thank you to every single person who has opened the door for me in the past.    

People who KNOW they might be inconveniencing you so they don‚Äôt rush you with several knocks.  Just one then patiently wait.    

People who tried within their power to get one but can‚Äôt because of lack of seniority.  So fine, be a jerk to me.  But don‚Äôt bitch at me for something I can‚Äôt do because if it‚Äôs that big of a deal for you to walk 5 steps to be recognized by the automatic door that will open for me if you just wave your arm or pink then don‚Äôt.  Be like the other guys who pretend not to hear me knock, at least they don‚Äôt make me feel like shit and we can pretend to be pleasant around each other because one day, one day when you forget your key, I will remember this moment.  

And today, **oh today.**  My supervisor told us to go eat the stupid sandwiches if we'd like within the next few minutes (when she told us, it was 4:40-50) so at 4:59, there was half a minute left before our shifts were over at 5 and we grabbed a sandwich.

trinidadnomad,21,,15,1r9s8q,,60,"I used to work for an electronic store and throughout the years things got kooky and crazy but this incident was one of the funniest we have ever had.

Ok so a couple of years back we started selling Hex bugs and for a while the sales were slow until one day I noticed our hex bug stock was low. I was so happy we were selling them so I decided to check our inventory on them to see how many had been sold that day. I looked and noticed we had sold 3.....but there was 7 missing from the display. I frantically started to search for them but found nothing and at that point told the manager and we decided to start paying attention more to them. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I notice we had some people come in and I noticed a girl went and stopped by the hex bugs for a second then took off. I was curious and decided to check our stock. Sure enough we were short one hex bug. I reported it and we started to keep an eye out on the hex bugs. 

A couple days passed and my coworker spots a girl come in and go to the hex bugs then leave. He calls me and we check the inventory again and sure enough we were missing two more hex bugs. At this point I started wondering why they were disappearing and I started thinking constantly about it. In fact it became a mild obsession and I started looking at all the angles and it was starting to drive me mad. A couple of days later I had enough of it. I grabbed a hex bug and took it out to play with it and didn't see the big deal about it. Here is what it looks like

A simple enough toys it has a vibration motor that makes it run around and that is all it does.....I didn't see anything interesting about it and turned it off then put it back in its test tube packaging. At that point the light in my head turned on and it went ""DING""  Holy crap in a hat Eureka! I took it out of the packaging and turned it on then put it back in the packaging and everything made sense. We had girls coming into our store and stealing the hex bugs because they were cheap vibrators!!!!! I presented my find with my evidence to my coworkers about my theory and everyone confirmed the hex bugs tend to disappear when ever girls would come into the store. Unanimously all of us agreed and decided to put the hex bugs in our view at all times to see if my theory check out to be true.

Later that day we had a girl come in and came up to the hex bugs next to the register. One of my coworkers asked her if she needed help and she darted out of the store. We were amazed and in awe of what had been happening in our little store. We presented my findings to the store manager and she made sure we kept the hex bugs on the counter at all times. She didn't want to ""contribute to deviant behavior"".

unidentifiableblarg,12,,12,1rhfwt,,62,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,64,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

So the other night I went to go see the new Hunger Games movie. It was Friday night and it was absolutely packed in the theater. Everyone was behaving themselves and seemed pretty excited about the movie.

Well, before the movie started, a group in the aisle next to me was taking a few pictures with flash. I thought it was mildly irritating, but, the movie hadn't started at that point so whatever.


Queue 15 minutes into the movie. Suddenly, out of the darkness, a really annoying camera flash. Like, the ones that do a few flash blips then a big FLASH. Everyone in that radius violently swivels their head towards him. Nobody says anything. Maybe he wouldn't do it again.


About 10 minutes later. ANOTHER flash. Seriously dude? Do those pictures even come out well? We live in 2013, you know what you are doing it completely fucking rude. I've seen people texting, talking, and even taking phone calls during a movie. Nothing topped that dude.


Well, he did it one more time. I'm not sure if anyone near him tried to say anything, but at that point I was pissed and needed to go get some popcorn anyways. I went to guest services and told them about the camera dude. I just wanted them to tell the dude to knock it off.


The guest service guys were SO AWESOME. They were really apologetic (not their fault!) and they gave me a free movie pass. I honestly didn't care about getting the free pass, but it seemed like they appreciated me saying something in advance. One of the employees goes into the theater and is watching in the back. Of course, Camera flash dude never took another picture for the rest of the movie. At this point, I was almost disappointed that he didn't take another picture. What if the movie employees thought I just conned my way into getting a free movie ticket? And the guy who followed me back into the theater was totally eating dinner. I felt bad about that.

KDR3989,9,,11,1ra3wz,,55,"I'm reasonably new to this subreddit (and reddit in general) but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here. I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories. This one in particular is inspired by /u/unmined most recent story.

Quick back story: I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school. After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chain

Our story begins on my first day of work. Which happened to coincide with my birthday . . . 

I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go. At this point I've just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens. After all, spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isn't exactly a dream come true. He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker (lets call him B)as to make sure I don't screw it up. At the time the department wasn't terribly large (at least not as big as it is now) so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall. As far as I was concerned the department didn't exist past the DVD racks, and B and myself were the only employees in the department. As soon as I'm starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what I'm doing I hear a female voice behind me, ""So this is the new guy, huh?""

I turn to see where the words are coming from and I'm completely blind-sided by what stands before me. She is the girl I've been searching my entire life for and I didn't even know it. She stands eye level with me (about 5'7"" if it matters) with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades. Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I can't look in to them for too long in fear I'll never find my way back out. I can smell a faint sweetness when she's near, almost like vanilla, which I find out later is from her body wash. In short, she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever want.

B finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only 2 seconds, ""Yea, his name's . . . what's your name again?""

In that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember, ""It's . . . umm . . . KDR3989!""

She cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle, ""That's an interesting name, where you named after [Insert Actor]""

Around the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work, ""Honestly, I'm not sure. I never thought enough to ask.""

""Heh, well I guess I'll see you around then!""

I wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner. I can still smell vanilla and she's all I can think about for the rest of my shift.

We continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation, except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases. Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasn't a very pleasant person to be around, and the word ""bitch"" was used a few times. It wasn't until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time together.

Our manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink. It was essentially a 5 foot tall, 10 foot wide section of madness. She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days. I find out the day she starts working on it that I'm the one that gets to help from our manager. As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers, ""I know this isn't gonna be a fun project and she isn't always the most friendly person but at least she isn't bad to look at!"" I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of this project.

During this time we talk . . . a lot. About everything from interests and hobbies, to our coworkers, where we grew up and everything in between. As it would happen most of our interests coincide. She reads comics as well, she's into computers (albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker), and we actually grew up only 15 miles from each other but in different school districts.

After that week of work I had decided, she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends. Eventually she stopped inviting the friends. And from there things ran their course. 

This story took place over 4 years ago. I'm very happy to say that I haven't changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her, and she hasn't either. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, retail is awful. The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid, and the pay is never enough to make up for it. We're on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee, but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life forever.

Stachahof,5,,13,1r0j3k,,50,"This is my first time posting here but I've been lurking for quite a while.  I work in a used media store that's privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part, I love it.  I get great discounts, I have plenty of regular customers who I like, and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no big-bad corporate to answer to.

Then there are the drawbacks.  Threats and cursing from customers who don't like their cash/trade offers and just overall rude people.  We also cater to low-income people because our prices are so low (the majority of our stock costs no more than $2.50) and while I don't want to generalize, a lot of them aren't the most desirable type of person.

This particular story happened about a month ago.  The couple in question is fairly regular, though I haven't seen much of them since this happened, but I've never liked them much.  They're usually pretty loud and dismissive.  

This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadn't worked.  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie.  No problem, my co-worker scanned their receipt and credited them $2.67 and they went to shopping.  

When they were finished, they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out.  As I took them, the man kept one and told me he didn't have to pay for that one because he'd brought another back.  We'll call him Dumb Fuck.

Me: No problem sir, I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer system.
DF: But I don't have to pay for it.
Me: You won't, sir.  I just need to scan it.

Reluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies.  I apply their discount and their total ends up being $10.68 for five movies.  The man pays and I think it's finished when he turns to his wife and says to her, not to me, ""She charged me for that movie.""

Immediately I'm irritated that he's talking about me as though I'm not there, but I bite my tongue and explain to him that he'd only paid for four movies.  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that I've over-charged him.  I pick up his movies, which I haven't bagged yet, and stack them on top of each other, adding the cost of them as I go.

""$2.67, $5.34, $8.01, $10.68, $13.35.""  Then I took off the top movie, the one he'd gotten for free, and set it aside.  ""$10.68.  You only paid for four movies, sir."" I smile.

DF: I can't believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refund.

I really have to fight back my anger at this point.

Me: Would you like me to go through the math again for you, sir?

A miracle, he finally addresses me.

DF: I don't need anyone to do math for me, I'm real good at math.

He complains for a couple more minutes, but eventually he takes his movies and leaves, still convinced that he overpaid for them.  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my co-worker to please watch the floor for a minute.  He couldn't stop laughing.","""She charged me!""",63,talesFromRetail

Sigillite,22,,20,1r4dqa,,50,"**Warning, language**

Posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qxrkh/so_long_and_thanks_for_well_nothing/) a couple of days ago about the lovely way the shitty co-owner of the restaurant I used to work at let me know that she was letting me go. but just not scheduling me! lovely. quick recap: I changed my availability for one shift, restaurant doesnt schedule me anymore, condescending owner wont return my calls. 

I called in today, two weeks after the fact, hoping to finally talk to her. Sure enough, she was there. I wish I had written it down so I could give you a more accurate transcript, but honestly, though most of it I was at a loss for words. FYI it is a small restaurant, with 2 bartenders and 2-3 servers on at one time taking 6-7 tables each. 

**Steph:** Thank you for holding this is Stephanie how can I help you?

**Me:** Hi Stephanie this is Dan

**S:** Hi Dan how's it going

**Me:** *thinking, seriously?* I was calling in to see why I wasnt scheduled the past two weeks, and why noone called me to tell me what was going on.

**S:** I wanted to talk to you about that, you see when you changed your availability we couldnt find any other shifts for you. You will have to switch with somebody to work three shifts a week.

**M:** What are you talking about, I opened up my availability when I said I couldnt work thursdays anymore. I am only trying to work three shifts a week, but I can do Monday through Friday nights, Friday and Saturday morning. How can you not find anything?

*At this point I'm not giving a fuck if I keep this job or not, I want this snide mother f-er to explain herself*

**S:** But people already have those shifts, I cant just switch them for you. Most of the other people are full time, so we do set schedules.

*We go back and forth for a while, with me trying to figure out A) Why she cant just schedule me, and move shifts around so that they can get coverage Sundays where they need it and have me fill the gap and B) Why it took her so long to tell me this*

**S:** So youre going to need to have somebody give up a shift so that you can get three a week.

**M:** Can you give me the numbers of the people that work those nights?

**S:** I can't do that, Maryland law won't let us

*BULL. SHIT. Every restaurant I've ever worked at has the numbers posted by the schedule*

**M:** Can you tell me who is working those days, or who is available Sundays?

**S:** No

**M:** So basically, what youre saying is that I have to drive all the way up there *20 minute drive* to talk to the two servers that are on, because I cant switch with a bartender, and talk to them while they're working to see if they would be able to switch with me? Hoping that they're actually available and amenable to working Sundays, and is actually able to discuss it and think about it during a shift.

**S:** Right

**M:**.......ok. *Fuck it* I also wanted to tell you that not trying to get in touch with me about this, neither calling me nor emailing me or even returning a phone call is extremely unprofessional. I've never had a boss do this, especially since you acted like nothing had happened when **I** called **YOU** just now.

**S:** Well the last time you worked I wanted to talk to you about it but you just ran out.

M: Because I was done, we just cash out to the bartender we dont need to talk to you guys. I left because I was finished, I didnt know you wanted to talk to me, why didnt you let me know before I left so that I would stay?

**S:** I was working on a catering order

**M:** Okay, so what, you expected me to just hang around on a saturday, past the time when I was scheduled to be done, when I had plans later that night, on the off chance that you may want to talk to me?? Come on....

**S:**.....Well I am really busy right now so you'll need to come up here and talk to me about this.

**M:** Ok fine, but again, not reaching out or even returning my calls was extremely unprofessional.

*while Im hanging up on her* 
**S:** Ok. Bye


I dont remember being hired as a manager, so no, I dont think that I am going to take care of the scheduling for you. If it was impossible to find one shift that you could change, out of five different days and 10-12 different people, than you just cant do your job. Sorry. There are so many awful business practices at that place they are only saved by the high quality of the wait staff, that she treats like shit, and their awesome food which the other owner is solely responsible for.

Anyways, cut to the present and I've managed to avoid PricklePants for about three weeks. 
He finally manages to come in during my shift. He says the cigarettes he wants, I ring him up, then this conversation happens:

PP: You're the bitch who charged me $5 for cigarettes aren't you?

Me: Well you got these cigarettes and the sign says $4.65 so yes. 

PP: (yelling at this point) You're gonna fucking argue with me?! You're arguing with ME?!

Me: I'm just telling you what the sign says

PP: No! This is what I smoke!! (Holds up an entirely different pack of cigarettes)


He then proceeded to call me a stupid bitch, a liar, and storm out of the store like a man child. 

I'm not allowed to ring him up anymore so the next time he came in I called someone up to the front to ring him up, and without saying a word he again stormed out of the store like a child.

cameronc93,9,,5,1r9q59,,48,"Wednesday night the power goes out at work, just a few minutes after we closed. The store goes pitch black for a few seconds until the emergency lights come on. We still had two groups of people sitting in the booths in the back of the restaurant (fast-food chicken joint). One of the tables, a few teenage girls, get up and leave. The other table was an older couple.

As all the employees from the back come up front to see what's going on, we hear the old man screaming ""TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON!"" We tell him the power's out, but he just keeps yelling about how he can't see. Now I know he was older and probably didn't have the best eyesight, but it wasn't that dark. With all the emergency lights, it was slightly less lit than in normal conditions. His wife keeps telling him the power's out, but he keeps walking towards us and yells ""Why don't you just kick us out instead of turning the lights off?!"" I looked at him, and loudly and firmly said ""THE POWER IS OUT."" He turned in a huff and walked out the door.

Story Time:

**Sort out what isn't your job to sort**

Had a lady transferred to me by a new starter, new starter took some payment over the phone but the account needed not to be paid so I get the call

Me: Hi there! You're through to [supervisor floor] how can I help?

SC: Yeah that guy just took my money
(OH NOES YOU'VE BEEN ROBBED!)

Me: Okay and what was that for?

SC: OH MY GOD IT WAS TO PAY OFF MY BALANCE ON MY LOAN

*aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnndddddddd stop*

Me: Ah ok sir, the loans for personal items are taken with [loan company]

Sc: Yeah?

Me: Well err, we don't deal with them because you're loan is with them

SC: Well can't you pay it off?

Me: Well no sir, because it's your loan. 

*Rinse and repeat* 

Like seriously, its like buying something on a credit card and going to the store and saying I want to pay off my credit card...GO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP CALLING YOU FOR THEIR MONEY!


**Second story, same day**

**Oh no it's your fault**

We have different depots that deal with different areas of the country, sometimes sales teams in H/O can change the default depot to something that might have it in stock, problem here is its on the other side of the country and you know can't travel through time and space - Every sales person knows (and it even tells the during the order process) to tell the customer delivery may be a few days later than their confirmation email since we have to get authorisation from a manager to ship it.

We get a call from H/O

Ho: Yeah err I have a customer on the line who was told he was getting delivery today and it hasn't arrived
me: Oh ok what's the details if you please

I check the order and nope, no one said nothing about delivery from our end

H/O: ""Well the customer is expecting it""
(I'm expecting to win the powerball but lookey here)

What's worse is the sales guy just kept saying the same thing, like literally ""Hes expecting it today"" no resolution, no ideas to the point I had to ask ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO""

He says he'll deal with it... 20 mins later we get a call, the customer called. I enter the details to see a note has been put on by our H/O that they told the customer to call us...Yeah thanks for that ass-socks now I get to explain the same thing all over again.

I explain to the customer he needed to wait for the auth from a manager before we could ship it out, he asked if he could cancel his order, I said unfortunately not.

Then. Karma. Came.

He paused and said ""Can I cancel it with them and take it with you?""

Usually we would say no, but I said ""Well if we were to do the order for you we wouldn't need the authorisation"" he replied with ""I demand you do it""

""Anything to keep the customer happy sir"" &lt;- at this point there was no suckyness from his part, he knew that there was a game that needed to be played and he knew that if this was brought to the big wigs he can say he demanded it and I just did what the customer wanted.

So we went ahead and did it, and I pocketed a nice commission (I can now afford a dessert at my hotel!!)

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is boxes; Shall we begin?**

I‚Äôve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery service.

My job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego. Occasionally, a box would show up that did not belong in my area. Sometimes, it‚Äôs because of a mistake farther down the line, or it could be a bad address (street does not belong in ZIP code), or it could be a major fuck-up caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me, when it did not.

This is about a major fuck up.

At the beginning of the shift, the unloaders (people who emptied out the massive silver trailers) and the ‚Äúpresorters‚Äù (people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts - one of which went to me), were under the impression that a large mail-order company was now in my area. It was not. But that didn‚Äôt stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my way.

When I would get a misrouted box, I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet (if it was small enough). If it was too large, or if the belt near my feel got backed up, the box had to go to one of six guys in my area. This pissed them off when it happened, because they had to touch something that did not belong to them. (technical note: this company is absolutely insane with logistics; they preach the art of touching something a few times as possible).

I did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible. So as the crap came in, I rotated the victim. Everyone except Badass-Ponytail was understanding.

Badass-Ponytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him. Over the course of the first two hours, I got called: asshole, faggot, fucker, mother fucker, pussy, pansy, goddamn piece of shit, mongoloid (surprised at this one, since it required knowing what it meant), blind, inbred, etc). Loudly.

The environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter. It was a dirty, shitty environment, and there was absolutely no decorum. This may have changed over the years, but in this era, there was zero censorship.

Permissive or not, personal or not, I had enough. It wasn't my fault, and there was zero I could do about it. So, I gave everyone else a break and started sending 100% of the misrouted load to Badass-Ponytail. I mean, if I‚Äôm going to get abused, I might as well give him a reason.

Box after box went to him. He very quickly got backed up, since he couldn‚Äôt handle is regular workload on top of the crap. His anger started boil. He was getting truly and sincerely angry. The verbal assault gained volume, and he started calling out for a supervisor. A supervisor did arrive, and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap. So he told Badass-Ponytail to stop being a baby.

At the hour three mark, he exploded. He began throwing boxes at me from about 15 feet away. I shut my belt down, turned around and played wide receiver. He threw, I caught, then stuck the box back on his belt. After a couple minutes of this, I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna die motherfucker!‚Äù

Badass-Ponytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me. He is both larger and stronger than I am, and I knew that if there was any actual violence, I would likely get thrashed. So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shield.

He charged into me, and I thrust the box into his chest, causing him to lose balance. Instead if hitting me, he had to right himself, or he‚Äôd fall about three feet onto a steel grate.

After stumbling, his mind cleared. ‚ÄúOne more fucking misroute and I‚Äôm going to kill you after work.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you, you retarded piece of shit. You‚Äôre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth. As for after work, just try. I‚Äôll fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytail.‚Äù

Now, I said a lot of stuff working here. It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality. I mean, if I saw him waiting for me, I‚Äôd run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back. I hate fighting, and had managed to avoid it since middle school.

But it worked, and he backed down. ‚ÄúLook, hand the stuff out fairly and we‚Äôll be cool. But you keep fucking with me and we‚Äôll have a problem.‚Äù

I punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute, but went back to being ‚Äúfair‚Äù again. No asses were kicked that day.

I sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise. Looking back, I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was. Everywhere else I‚Äôve working in life, both of us would have been fired on the spot. And we would *deserve* it.

PepperAnn90,5,,11,1r4g87,,45,"I am a sales leader in a boutique-style, Swedish-inspired children's clothing store. The area is pretty affluent and educated, so we don't get very many people who have lost all common sense. This is a short story of someone who might have.

I was the sole person on the floor with about 6 customers in my store. I was deep in the process of a return when a lady asked if she could hold something at the register. Being such a small store, I said yes, as we can generally keep track of whose pile of stuff is whose and check them out when they're done shopping.

A few minutes later, I've finished the return and processed a few other transactions when I realize the lady has left the store, and left her items on the cash wrap. No name, no phone number, nothing. Just left. Okay...well, I can hold this for a bit and see if she comes back, I suppose.

Three hours later, she hasn't returned and we sell her items. I warn my relief manager (RM) that this lady might come back in, but I'm not sure. Two hours after that, I leave for the day.

The next day, I come in for my closing shift. RM from the day before had opened, and filled me in on what happened after I left:

Lady comes back and says she has items held for her. Nobody can find them, because we don't have them anymore. The lady got pissy and said, ""Well, the girl with the short reddish-brown hair said she would hold them for me."" (I am the ONLY person who works in my store who matches that description.) Essentially, RM told her that we didn't have any more in stock in the right size, so they could order it or she could wait until another came in. Lady decides against the dress, but RM does so much ass-kissing that she still makes a $600 sale.

I'm trying to figure out how she thought I could hold the items for her with no name, no phone number, and no time she would be back for them. Hell, I've been to department stores that require a credit card number for a hold. SOMETHING. Like, I can't just hold it for ""Short Blonde Lady with Baby in a Sling"". That's a physical description of about 30% of our customers. Ugh.

thelittleblueones,4,,13,1rahas,,44,"A quick one from back in my days as a cashier at a large grocery chain. I was 15 years old and wasn't too invested in the company, it was just a job to put a few dollars in my pocket. That said, I was fairly decent at the customer service aspect and only ever had one complaint. 

A mom and a young child, maybe 5 or 6, came through my lane just to buy the kid a tube of M&amp;MS minis. The kid put the candy and a coupon for a free tube on the belt. I thought it was cute that she was being a big girl and doing the transaction herself. I scanned the candy and the coupon, but the ""free"" coupon didn't take off sales tax, which came to a whopping two cents. When I asked the mom for the two pennies, you'd have thought I'd thrown acid in her face by the look she gave me. The slammed the pennies down, grabbed her kid, and left without another word. 

A few minutes later my supervisor (who spoke English as a second language) came over and asked ""why you no be nice to customer? You be nice to customer!"" I asked what I'd done, and she said the woman had complained about me asking her to pay the two cents. I asked if she would have preferred my drawer be short the two cents.

ArQuesta,27,,20,1r3xmk,,49,"Hello again, fellow retail slaves. I've posted a few times before, but mostly about my time before college, when I worked at a Stop for Gamers. Not today. I meant to go get some reading done this evening, but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and I'm car-less at the moment, so I decided to tell you about a recent story.

I just got done with my Bachelor's this summer. I know, I should have escaped the abyss that is retail, but I'm stuck at home, saving up money to move to the D.C. area at the moment, while also filling out grad school applications, as well as working on big job applications. I'm in a stupid spot and I need money, so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a three-minute walk from home. Score.

For the most part the job is fine, no real horrible people to be found. The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping, so it's fine with me if they like being pricks. They just spent $6 on a f*cking drink. 

Anywho. Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness. I was working the drive-thru window, which, at night, meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot. During a rush there's two of us, as people's drinks go from normal to downright stupid-complicated. But, alas, there's always a button for it.

A nice, shiney $40k+ car pulls up, my last customer in a long line rush. She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chit-chat. Now, for some background, I have the worst baby face. I mean, it's great that I look young, but depending on the person my 28 years looks like 20. I don't wear make-up, drink, or smoke, so I am lacking any pre-wrinkles and I'm chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks. It's fine though, as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly. For this conversation I'll use BAC for the lady, and Me as me.

BAC: ""Oh, are you still in school right now?""

Me: ""Actually I just finished, I'm working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feet.""

BAC: ""Oh, what did you major in?""

Me: ""East-Asian studies."" *chuckles* ""It's kind of useless around here.""

BAC: ""Would you say that you could talk about your major confidently?""

Me: *at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college, or needs a strangely specific tutor* ""Oh, yeah, I can talk for days about culture, history, politics, language, etc for days.""

BAC: ""Have you ever read the bible?""


Me: *shitshitshitshit, here it comes* ""...Well, a bit when I was younger.""

BAC: *with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes* ""When I was in college, my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes, one where God existed and one where he doesn't. Sure, if you're in the box where he isn't there, fine, but what if you're in the other one? Is it really that harmful to believe?""


Now, at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers, and had tuned out the conversation, as she told me afterwards. I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me, but alas, I was trapped.


Me: *remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view, but deciding not to argue at work* ""Well, as a kid my dad let me try out every religion, and I've built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them. If I had to subscribe to anything--""

BAC: ""Some people are really fake, you know? They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area."" *suddenly angry* ""I know a lot of fake people, and they aren't people you should call friends.""

Me: *the fuk?*

This was the most annoying part...

BAC: *suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching* ""What are you going to do after you're done with school?""

Me: ""I dunno, work for the government?""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Take care of my parents and family.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Travel or work abroad.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""I've thought about adopting.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Live my life happily?""

BAC: ""What about after life?""

Me: ""There's nothing.""

BAC: *legitimately surprised* ""And you're okay with that?""

Me: ""Well, yeah, we're not immortal. You live to the best of your ability until you die.""

BAC: *changing tactics* ""When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson, really friendly, but it was fake. People are fake. Then I read the bible. There's something there, if you read it you'll understand.""

Me: ""Maybe one day I'll read it, but it's not--""

BAC: ""Well, you know, everyone has problems, right?""

Me: ""Of course.""

BAC: *surprised for some reason that I've agreed with her* ""Well, how do you deal with problems?""

BAC: ""My husband used to be addicted to money, sex, and drugs.""


This is about where my patience absolutely ended, my face started to crack a grin. I'm not an arrogant person, but I write, I read, I study constantly. I'm an intelligent person, and I wasn't going to allow her to outwit or -speak me, but I was also trying to be unfailingly polite.

And then, like God himself saying ""Jesus lady, shut up"" the drive-thru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel, I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian, and turned away from the window. As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions. My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened. I was a little mortified. I mean, here was this lady with a car worth more than my four-year education, lecturing a girl (lol) who she thought was in the middle of college (~20), working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a, what she thought, excellent education. If she only worked retail, than dear drug-dealing hubby must have paid for that, right? At what point did she have the right to say that I wasn't spiritual? I'm very spiritual, and I have my own views of spirituality. At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs, money, and sex? Not only that, did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the non-religious simply because I told her I was educated? 


Plus she didn't tip that poor drive-thru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool. Seriously.

Toni-Cipriani,3,,12,1rdgs7,,45,"Just a short and small story. I work in a small independent corner/liquor store. Anyways in the later hours of my very slow evening a man enters the store and since I was walking past the area where the door is I just said ""Hey what's up man? How are you?"" To no response and him practically looking through me.

Ahh well,  it happens so I go on about my business and about 4 minutes later after he finishes picking out some beer he steps over to the front counter. The look on his face when he noticed I stepped up behind the cash register (And the fact that I was the only person working in the store that night)  was pretty priceless, he turned a bit red and made sure to try and act somewhat chummy with me.

Him: Oh.... I'm sorry... I totally disregarded you.

Me (mentally) Yeah you sorta did...

What I actually said: Oh no worries man, what can I get you?

Metroidzoid,4,,5,1refmp,,45,"So while it is [this woman's](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qvkqw/i_am_counting_the_days_until_she_leaves/) second-to-last day, I don't have to work with her on the same shift, so I was counting the hours until we no longer shared the same time clock. 

She made those minutes crawl by at an exhausting rate.

But I did two things that, in any normal circumstances, I might not be proud of.  But today, I regret nothing.  The first was near the end of the shift.  Because I needed to count one of the tills, I was vacuuming the front carpets, a task normally done while other cashiers counted cash.  So I started the task about 30 min. early, giving myself time to stop for customers coming up to the register, and for load-outs as well.

She's on her phone.  Again.  She's the damn primary cashier and she's just sitting there!  ON THE GODDAMN PHONE!  I stop what I'm doing, ring up the customer quickly, then bypass every carpet I had started on the far side of the counter, and just started vacuuming all around the gift-wrap table.  Last Day Woman was surprisingly resilient, and managed to keep a conversation the entire time while her voice was elevated enough that I think the loading dock heard it.

The second petty act was while all three off us were on the register.  Well, me and pleasant co-worker started, had the line pretty much under control, but Last Day addressed her own concerns first and dragged over a customer she had been helping (but who wasn't waiting in line) over to the third register.  I warned her that the til had been acting up since Friday, and did not except plastic.  ""Oh, no it's fine.  I've been running transactions all day""

""But those were cash, you can't us-""

""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING""

I left her to it.  In the mean time, the line grew longer.  And longer.  About the same time I hear a voice behind me saying ""I don't know why it's not working"", and then a tap on my shoulder as LD wants me to get off my register so she can ring up her friend.  I could not help but smirk slightly as I told her that I was ringing up people who were already in line, and she would have to wait.

Please for the love of everything don't let this woman extend her 'two-ish weeks'.  What gods have I slighted to die in such company?","I am a petty, petty man, and I hold no regrets",50,talesFromRetail
Sasparillafizz,22,,33,1r3ozm,,45,"Not a great story, but was so ""Your joking, right?"" I felt I could post it so others could share in my bafflement.

Got a phone call earlier today at (Insert specialty gaming store here.) 

Our phone call customer, we'll use PG for Phone guy, called regarding his Xbox1 reserve.

Now, for the pre-orders for the console, we took a down payment as a deposit for the console to make sure you are actually going to pick it up. Otherwise everyone and their grandma would try to 'reserve' on of the new consoles and only a fraction of them would have the money/time/etc to pick it up at launch. These deposits are of course fully refundable if you change your mind. Or if you go buy it from a competitor, ebay, etc. 

Reserved items are held for 48 hours, we will absolutely guarantee it remain in stock that long for you if you preorder. We aren't going to hold it a week, a month, or longer; sitting around collecting dust and shooing away customers who want to purchase the item you can't be bothered to pick up because you put down a 20% deposit months ago. This is ESPECIALLY true with systems and collectors sets, which we hold VERY FIRMLY to the 48 hour rule.

Onto the story!

PG: ""I had a question about the Xbox 1 I had reserved.""

Sasparilla: ""Go ahead?""

PG: ""Well see, I have a bit of a family emergency, and won't be able to pick up the Xbox until tuesday and-""

At this point I cut him off, having done this conversation so. many. times. this day alone; let alone the last week. ""Regretfully sir, the consoles can only be held till 6pm on Saturday. If you don't pick it up Saturday night, it will go on sale on sunday to the first buyer.""

PG is PISSED. ""What do you mean you'll sell it? I paid for it!""

Sasparilla: ""You placed a deposit on the item in question to have it set aside for you. If you do not pick it up within the hold period, we cannot guarantee we will have it in stock when you come to pick it up.""

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!""

Sasparilla: ""How so?""

PG: ""Your supposed to hold it 48 hours! It comes out friday.""

Ah, I see the problem. Not the original problem addressed, but the bone he is currently chewing on. ""We are starting the pre-ring process at 6PM on Thursday. The consoles will be paid for and purchased, but they won't be handed over the counter until midnight. Its to preven-"" 

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!"" 

Ah. A street savvy lawyer here. Sasparilla: ""We can, and are, Sir. We can ring up the products early, the steet date only prevents us from handing the product to customers early to get an advantage over competitors. No matter where you go, you will not get your hands on a Xbox one before midnight. But we can make the purchase any time we please.

PG: ""You can't do that!""

Sasparilla: ""We can, and are sir. Microsoft has never had a problem with us doing this for any of their products in the past. Since the items are being sold at 6PM Thurs, you have 48 hours to pick it up."" 

PG: ""Well I cant get there till Tues."" 

Sasparilla: ""Then your console will be sold on Saturday after six. You ca-""

PG: ""You can't do that! We had a CONTRACT.""

Note to any armchair lawyers, we do not. A deposit is not a purchase of the product, merely that he has offered the payment ahead of the time of exchange. The terms of this are clearly spelled out, and his offer is refundable at any time if an agreement (payment at price at time of purchase) is not made.  

Sasparilla: ""Sir, our terms are very clearly explained. If you do not show up for your purchase it will be sold. There is very high demand for the Xbox 1, we cannot hold it for you till Tues. At best, I can hold it to the end of saturday night.""

PG: ""You said you have to hold it 48 hours!""

Sasparilla: ""We are. From opening Friday, to closing saturday."" 

PG: ""Thats not 48 hours!""

...

Your kidding right? Your killing me here.

Sasparilla: ""From open to close Friday. And open to close saturday. Each day is 24 hours apart. This adds up to 48 hours. We can hold your console till then.""

PG: ""Well I can't make it till tues!""

Sasparilla (silently) /to f-ing bad?/

Sasparilla: ""Do you have someone who could pick it up for you?""

PG: ""I dunno, my friend could."" 

Sasparilla: ""If you pay for the console in full and provide him with the receipt, he can come in before Sat and pick up your console for you. I'll even make a note on the account that another person will pick it up for you with the receipt.""

PG: ""Fine. You better have my damn console for me. I gotta go visit my aunt in the hospital! I shouldn't be punished for this!""

Sasparilla: ""As long as your here before saturday at closing.""

verynotberry,14,,8,1r0rm7,,42,"I've been out of retail for several years, but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia.  I worked in a store in a smaller town, where you aren't always slammed and get to know your customers.  There was one family I'll always remember with fondness.  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it. I looked forward to their visits. These were truly kind, wonderful people.

However, there were also the jerks.  The guy I'm going to tell you about is one of those.  Now, normally when someone would be a jerk to me, I would tend to write it off.  It's not personal, I'm not verynotberry, I'm the cashier.  If it happened every time they came in to the store, that was another story.  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers.  Talked down to us, treated us like idiots, the lot.  But one day, one glorious day, I got my petty revenge.

He came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases.  While counting the change, I noticed a Canadian penny.  This store was in the U.S.  So . . . not legal tender.  I tell coin man, CM, for short that I can't accept his penny.

CM:  What?  Why not?

Me:  Well, it's not legal tender.  

CM:  Why not? 

Me:  Well, this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada, so I cannot accept this.

&lt;bear in mind, I'm smiling and as friendly as I could possibly be&gt;

CM:  What?  That's bull----.  Just take the d--n penny!   (Truly, he was a gifted debater.)

Me:  Well, sir, I would, but outside the boundaries of Canada, this is not legal tender, so I cannot accept this.

CM:  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE!  

&lt;Because I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins, don't you?&gt;

Me:  Sir, if that is true, I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them, but as it stands, I will need an American penny.

(It's important to note that throughout this entire process, he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars' worth of coins.)

CM:  Oh Jesus.  Fine.

He throws a penny on the counter.  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest, kindest, most customer-friendly smile.

Me:  Thank you so much, sir.  Please have a nice day.

Now, if this had been any of our other customers, I would have taken the penny no questions asked because, hey, the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly, so it's easy to miss.  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny, but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel small.

It felt amazing!

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,9,1rhw8z,,58,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Mystic-Spiral,3,,9,1rfdiq,,43,"Greetings fellow retail workers, happy Thanksgiving! 

While we all wait for Thursday/Friday this week I think it would be good for us all to focus on the positive. We have all had them, the customers that make us laugh, smile, or say the inappropriate thing that we ourselves were thinking but couldn't say out loud. 

One of my favorite stories takes place on a Sunday. I'm not sure what it is, but Sundays are awful. No matter where I have worked Sunday has brought out the mean demanding, and crazy customers.

This Sunday was no different. I was working open to close and everyone was as pissy and demanding as possible. I was exhausted and flying on autopilot when a middle aged woman approached my counter to pay for a few items. 

The items she had chosen were final sale pieces. Even though these items say final say in red on the tag I will always remind customers that these pieces can not be returned or exchanged (which of course people try to do at least once a week).  

So I greet this fabulous lady and begin to ring up her selection. I launch into my usual spiel.
""Now these are final sale pieces which means they can't come back or be exchanged.""

Cue the customer throwing her arms up towards the heavens and proclaiming in a loud voice ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T BRING BACK THIS FIVE DOLLER SHIRT? WHATEVER WILL I DO?! OH NO, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL LIVE WITH KNOWING I CAN NOT RETURN THIS!""

I'll admit, at first I thought she was serious and was bracing myself for the onslaught, because that had been my whole day up til that point. 

Then a beautiful thing happened. She put her arms down, smiled at me, winked and said ""I think I will survive paying five dollars for a shirt and not being able to return it.""

I blinked as I processed what had just happened and then I just lost it. I laughed so hard! I rang her up and while still giggling informed her that she had just made my day and won my coveted favorite customer if the day award. She laughed. I laughed. My Sunday got a little better.

partinobodycular,22,,11,1r701h,,43,"I'm an assistant manager at a shoe store with a free rewards program. You get 10 points for every dollar you spend, and every 1500 points gets you a $10 off certificate. One of my associates, A, had just signed up a customer who was leaving the country the next day and I guess wanted to take shoes for everyone back home. The customer ended up spending about $800. Normally, the points are added to the account when we close the registers at the end of the day, and it can take a couple of weeks to actually see your certificate. But since this girl was leaving, I did some quick math and gave her $50 off. After she left, I pulled A aside to show her how to fill out a points adjustment form so we could email customer service and say, ""Hey, we already honored a bunch of these points, so you can deduct them."" A is fairly new - I think she started in September? She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now. Most of the time.

Part of the form is to explain how many points need to be added/deducted, and why, so I asked out loud how many points would get you $50 off. I could have figured it out in my head, but hey, ~~this was a teaching moment~~ I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldn't have to. Turns out, she didn't know how many points it takes to get a certificate. Okay... this is kind of Rewards 101. I ask a few more questions to see what she *does* know. Turns out, she also doesn't know details about how points are earned. This is really basic stuff. Any customer could ask her these questions at any time. So I give her a quick rundown, and then toss an easy one her way.

""How many dollars do you have to spend to get 1500 points?"" She doesn't know. I'm getting frustrated, so I grab some paper and write it down, thinking that'll help her see how simple it is. 10 points per dollar, how many dollars for 1500 points? All you have to do is divide 1500 by 10, but A can't do it. She's starting to get a blank look, and I realize I need to back off; I believe she has the capability to solve this question, but she's shutting down. I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know, and let her go.

A few minutes later, it's time for A's fifteen, so I look around to see where she's gone to. I don't see her on the floor. I'm starting to get a bad feeling. I ask her friend, C, if she knows where A is, and C says she's in the bathroom. Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature. I started worrying that I had been too harsh, and that A was now crying in the bathroom. I'd never made an associate cry before. I watch for A to come back out onto the floor, and the longer I wait, the worse I'm feeling. Finally I see her come out, and she looks composed. I wait a minute to give her some space - I don't want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out - and then head over to see if she's okay and tell her to go on her fifteen. She says she's already gone, so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down. Fair enough, though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break. She mentions that she felt too much pressure, and then says that B, the main cashier, had laughed at her. This is kind of unsurprising, B is one of our biggest troublemakers. I have plenty of other stories to tell about B, but I'll save them for another night.

malnormalish,19,,7,1r9oo9,,40,"So I work at an art craft store and we sell these crazily popular rubber band bracelet looms  along with rubber band refill packs. They come in a multitude of colors but we usually only have 3-4 colors at a time. Every day I have people coming up asking if we have any other colors, which is a valid question. I tell them that no, what we have out is all that there is, and then half of the time they ask, ""Are you sure?""  No, I'm not sure, I'm just pulling that out of my ass...


When I tell them yes, I'm definitely sure, I've seen more people than I would have guessed throw tantrums. I've gotten people asking if I could just double check in the back (No, nothing in the back) and even had a couple people offer me extra cash on the side if I could give them a certain color, trying to bribe me.

It's absolutely crazy how these people act trying to get these looms. Seriously, we have sold 230 of them in one night.

It was like a showdown in a movie. They glared at each other before one lady just quickly grabbed it and walked away.

A couple annoying things to note about this product is that we have moved the display for it from about the middle of the store to quite literally the frontmost center of the store, standing there right as the customers walk in. These customers have to walk past the display directly to my counter where they ask me where the product is. I usually just point and they follow my dead-eyed stare to the display behind them. Then the customer will walk over, pluck one from the shelf, ignoring the neon-colored, bolded signs printed on 8x12 pieces of foamboard stating that no coupons are to be accepted on the looms. The customer then promptly whips out a coupon. When I then tell them I cannot use said coupon, most of them are annoyed but okay, while others tell me it's bullshit and storm out threatening to never come back to the store again,  saying that ""The coupon is the only reason I came!"". 



Of course all of you know that people do not read and refuse to even attempt to observe their surroundings, blaming poor cashiers for problems out of their control, so my tale should not come as a surprise. 


So to end this rant I just wanted to ask what products sold at your place of work give you the most frustration. This loom kit has been probably the worst to deal with for me. I see people get insanely angry about these things-- it's sort of funny but also very horribly frustrating.

Connor_Mulhern,12,,5,1r9vwx,,41,"Ok, so I work at a big box store returning carts. I also happen to be the only person I know of that can speak Spanish in the entire store, so despite me working outside it is not uncommon for them to call me back to a department to translate. 

So like any normal day I get to work I get out of my Arabic class and head over to work. I am a couple minutes early and I usually wait outside for my shift to start, but they find me and immediately tell me to go clock in because they need somebody who speaks Spanish.

So I head up to the department, it‚Äôs a middle aged Hispanic dude, can‚Äôt speak English, asking about a well pump and how deep it goes. I am the middle man and while my Spanish is very good, my knowledge of Spanish plumbing terms is rather limited, so occasionally I had to pause and think over how to say it, or I would have to convert from feet to meters in my head, or something like that. 

Now, during one of the pauses I apologize and say sorry I just got out of Arabic class, I can‚Äôt quite remember the word. So this middle aged Hispanic dude just says to me ‚ÄúEs parte de Al-Qaida‚Äù? Are you part of al-Qaida. Now keep in mind I am one of the whitest people on the planet, especially during the late fall/early winter. I kind of try and blow it off and try to make it sound like he was joing but he kept pushing the subject, why are you learning Arabic. We eventually get him out but upon telling this story to my co-workers I immediately gain the nickname Jihad.

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching cause' they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left. The other sales person still got the sale etc, but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her, still want my 2500 back though.",Is that stealing?,44,talesFromRetail
Lightfairy,4,,7,1r445p,,34,"Been posting a few stories. You can find them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=author%3ALightfairy&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Many many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier. This supermarket was in a large shopping centre. Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was 33 years ago. Wow! Time has flown! 

This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt. Bomb threats had been made to various stores. We, the staff, thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work. The alarm would go off, we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time, we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again. 

We were having a bomb scare every couple of days. All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened. 

Then, in the space of nine days three stores were bombed. The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve. The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest. 

Cue this story. Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert. A lady comes up to my check out. Two carts of frozen goods. Chickens, 4 litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine. I start putting the order through. Keep in mind this was back in the dim, dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from. No scanners back then. I was slaving away, making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off. 

By this time we all knew the drill precisely. Pull the cash draw, throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately. We did not muck around any more! So, with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit, I pull the draw and prepare to exit. 

'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?' I hear screamed at me. My customer with all the frozen goods. 

I turn to her and say 'Would you please exit the store immediately. It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent events.'

She is having none of it. 'What about all my food. Only part of it is rung up and I need it. You have to finish my order. It will only take 5 or 10 minutes.'

With thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say, 'Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta here!!'

Thankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time. I jump on the train and head 1. 5 hours west. Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home (it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked) as they were having a bomb scare as well!! Total of two bomb scares in one day for me!

I heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store. As for that ladies '5 or 10 minutes'? They received only a 10 minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve. They managed to evacuate over 2000 people before it went off. No one got hurt. They have never charged anyone over the event. I left the job shortly after. This kind of ruined my taste for working check out. 

TL;DR Ice cream and bombs don't go together. Just ask my customer.

BraveSouls,10,,10,1rfyes,,35,"**Some background:** I work for a privately owned consignment shop. For those that don't know, it's a second-hand shop (though we also sell new items), but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them. We take the items in and once they sell, we get a commission off the sale, and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month. We sell both in store and on eBay.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  

This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter. She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it. I smile thinking that's very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter. The greater majority of our big furniture is right in the middle of the store when she walks in so she looks around while I go back to my laptop to continue working on an eBay listing.  
[](/spacer)      
[](/spacer)  
She asked me random questions here and there about the different items then finds her way to the back where we have a large screen TV for sale. She calls my attention and the conversation went something like this:

**Old Lady:** How much for the TV?

**Me:** $30

**OL:** Okay I'll probably take it. Does it come with a remote?  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)

My boss, who was processing item drop offs, overheard and said there wasn't one with the TV but we had a separate remote next to it. It was one of those big button universal remotes that likes to think bigger is better (Note: I know why they're really that size). At this point she told me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it. I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her I'd be right back and to feel free to look around more.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
I noted the brand of the TV (can't remember what it was) and went to my laptop with the remote. I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didn't have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV. I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it. I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better. The whole process took about 20 minutes, including the other questions she had about stuff in the store. She was very grateful and purchased the TV, remote, and a wall plaque.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The next trick was getting the TV into her car. This wasn't a flat screen. It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie. It was also very heavy. So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car. Silly him doesn't have a dolly so I'm looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements. I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little. I'm worried it won't fit but he is unfazed. He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space. Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV. He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didn't want to come back inside.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
**OL:** So now what?

**Me:** I'll just get your name and number and we'll put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it up.

**OL:** Okay, but what about my money?

**Me:** Huh? (Thinking *'uh oh'*)

**OL:** Can I get my money back? I don't know if I'll have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get home.

**Me:** Well, we certainly will hold the TV for you until you're ready to pick it up since you've already paid for it. We won't be able to hold it for your otherwise. (It's worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV. But as it was only $30 and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items, he doesn't allow deposits for items anymore.)

**OL:** I know, but I'm worried about getting it out of my car. Can I just get my money back?

**Me:** *'Oh boy.'* I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The shop has a no returns policy. My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if it'll work or not but he's otherwise firm against returns. This is due to the nature of the business. Someone pays for a consigned item, we send a sale check out to the consignor, then that person decides to try to return it afterward isn't exactly good for business. Either way, I couldn't give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story. He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant, yet still nice about it, so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote. She didn't ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldn't have anyway. She thanks us and leaves.   
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation. At the very least we didn't have to move the TV. It's still sitting in the shop looking for a home. Poor thing.

So I go to my gallery and...huh? There's a video in my download file? That's weird, because I have never downloaded a video in my life on my phone (I probably wouldn't even know how to do so). I click it and...BAM! A whopping 17 minutes of gay porn. Wow, okay, so THAT'S something my adolescent eyes didn't want to see. I immediately start trying to think of where and HOW this video could have gotten downloaded on my phone when...wait, this video was uploaded last Saturday at 4:40 pm? That's weird, I worked an 11-7 shift last Saturday, which I remember pretty clearly because it took up my entire afternoon. So the next step is to go check my internet history and..wow, how WEIRD. The only internet history I have is from two separate dates, 11/22 (from last night when I was trying to look up something for a friend), and 11/19, when I was looking up someone's address because I needed it for my National Guard papers. I've used the internet a lot in the past six months I have my phone, and I've never deleted my internet history before, so...huh. It seems to me like somebody went on the internet, found a gay porn, downloaded it on my phone, and deleted my internet history so I wouldn't find out. Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed. I like to think I'm a well liked employee, especially by the managers, but I know some people don't like me because I'm 17 and receiving training to become a manager, even though I've only worked there for six months while other people have been there for years without a promotion. The video source seems like it comes from the internet rather than a text message, and even then, I would never download a multimedia file from someone I don't know, and I haven't received any texts like that, ever. So yeah. I'm probably going to talk to the store manager about possible sexual harassment even though it's going to be hard to find out who did it, and I'm probably only going to take about $5 with me to work at all times because if someone is going to go into my purse and download porn onto my phone, who knows what else they might do?

Takeabyte,8,,8,1r3uuj,,34,"The former VP of a computer company's retail division had a lot of policies that were intended to improve the customer experience. He was a strong believer that we sales people could deter thieves simply by talking to them and that having security measures like empty boxes of software, door alarms, and fake products were nothing but an annoyance to customers and would ruin the vibe.

Shout out to /r/JealousyGrey and his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r24y4/they_do_know_theyre_fake_right/) that reminded me of this gem...

The worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves. I worked in a much smaller store than most, the shelves were only about 20 feet away from the door. At any given time, there would be $50,000 to $100,000 worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had. Everything ranging from the full version of design software, productivity software, portable hard drives, headphones, etc. Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe. Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard. Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate (like a grocery store) so we were required to put products where they told us to put them. For example, when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space, we'd have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display. It was madness. Over the years though, they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took over..

The worst for us was a video editing program. It cost $1,299 and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets, but it also made it way easier to grab and run with. Anyway, a box of that would go missing *every week!* It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell! We'd look over, notice it was missing, ask everyone working, usually only 5 or 6 of us including one technician and one manager (it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once) anyway, we'd ask everyone if they sold it, and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it. We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf instead.

So, life goes on and time passes. The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again. Meanwhile, a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up. One time, I was playing billiards in their garage and there's this one guy who was there because he was a [kleptomaniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store... I couldn't believe it. I was playing pool with the guy that stole about $20,000 worth of software. He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair. People almost got fired for that shit! It was crazy. I wanted to punch the guy in the face!

Oh well, he did go to jail for a couple years and [I whooped his butt at pool](http://i.imgur.com/QqHzZ.gif). He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things. Looking back at it now, it obviously didn't effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gear.

**TL;DR**: Someone stole a *lot* of software from the store. I met him years later and beat him... at playing pool.

I have *soooo* many other stories from working that store for so long, I'll tell you guys some more later. For now I'll just wish you a safe holiday season, stay strong, and eat a breakfast.

All the best,

meguriau,19,,14,1refgz,,33,"Hi TFR! Today's [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens. I was really happy with myself but don't have any coworkers to share the moment with! Here goes (: 

 **Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

The weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day, overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain. As a store specialising in hats, this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers. On quiet days like these, I typically wind up 'gardening': this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but, rather, a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave. It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first. Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be, flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike. As a completionist, the process invokes feelings of frustration, rage and self-pity. 

After this ordeal, I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break. This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance, is quite elevated so that people can't peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need be.

One bite into a delicious banana muffin (baked by my mother), the sensor by the door went off. I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water, emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple, poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares. Let's call the man DHS for designer hat snob. DHS and wife, it so seemed, had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option. Pet peeve #1. Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation. He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointment.

**HB:** EXCUSE ME. YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATS.

The brand does stock men's hats. In fact, there is a display window showcasing the more popular men's styles which he had clearly missed. In some ways, it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately. Unfortunately, this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly **male** models wearing similar hats in the backdrop, some of them topless for good measure. Pet peeve #2.

**M:** We do stock men's hats. They're just up the back, near the counter and to your right.

This appeared to pique his interest. Without so much a thank you, DHS and wife scuttled over to the men's section. Pet peeve #3. I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing inside.

DHS rams the nearest ivory-white $325 panama hat on his head.

**DHS:** It's too small.

**M:** The men's panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yo-

**DHS:** -grunt-

I continued to give him the best smile I could muster. Pet peeve #4.

DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips out.

**DHS:** Ridiculous! This is more expensive than a Borsalino! (For those of you that are unaware, Borsalino is a Italian-made designer hat brand)

He stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount. To be completely honest, I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry (but of course, I wasn't going to let my ignorance be known). Knowing I wouldn't get a sale from him anyway, I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile. Without anything to argue against, the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance. 

I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin. it tasted like victory. I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face. 

Later during the day, I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats. My findings were interesting. For his statement to be true, there were two possiblities.

1. Yes, the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats. However, the hat he was referring to was a papier hat (‚Ç¨154 or about AUD $230), basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm. The panama hats Borsalino sold were in the ‚Ç¨280+ range (~AUD $420+)

2. Currency conversion means nothing to him and, therefore ‚Ç¨280 = AUD $280.

DrChiefChef,10,,9,1r31cw,,34,"This tale (also my first) comes from a land of happiness and joy, right? no? okay I lied it comes from the place where Dreams go to Die. 

Ever since I was younger I always wanted to work at this theme park here in Florida, I mean I always thought it would be so cool, so when the acceptance into working for this company came I jumped on it. I've been here since May and when I thought I would be working in a kitchen or something related to my major of Culinary Arts, I was wrong. 

I currently work at one of those Popcorn and Ice cream wagons you typically see in theme parks and normally I can get through a day just because I love the people I work WITH. This is not the case of last Monday.

(technically this is retail related cause I do sell some merchandise things)

Mondays shift was from 5:45pm to 12:15am so overall not too bad. I was put at a cart that most wagons close With or Around Park closing time so I was pretty confident that I wasn't closing anything (Closing is a bitch to do when you have closed 90 percent of every week that you work, especially popcorn wagons) I get in and see my name on the closing list as closing Popcorn 1, at this point my heart sinks because that means I wont be getting out of here till at least 1am. 

The day goes by alright, until about 10:00pm (wagon closes at 10:30 for some weird reason when park is open till 12)
Here are a few minor things that just built up

* People decided that it was okay to throw money at me when paying for something
* When I ask how someones day is at least say okay or good don't ignore that I asked and just start with your order, believe it or not I do care how your day is going
* A guy came up and cut my line during the middle of a transaction with another guest and asks what happens if he dropped his frozen lemonade, well normally we would just give him a new one but since I had a hunch he was straight up lying to me I asked some questions; such as Where he dropped it (he wasn't too sure where they were) and how long ago he bought it and where (like 20 minutes ago and from this cart but not from me; huh thats funny I've been here the WHOLE DAY no break for me yet) and he said he ""thinks that their were three that dropped on the ground"" I told him without the carton or lid or some proof I could not just replace 3 free lemonades. 

(Note: I didn't even call the managers because I knew that they would just give in and give him the 3 free, I really didn't care at that point though)

And the grand prize of my shitty night ended at 10 minutes before closing. This lady comes up too my wagon and wants to buy two 12 dollar popcorn souvenir buckets so I go and grab them and start to fill them while she fishes out her card (more efficient this way, not practical I know) 

So I come back after filling these buckets and she's trying to pay with this feature that the theme park has for resort guests that is on their wrists. well it wasn't accepting her pin so I asked for her back-up which is an actual card that  they are given at check in and told to keep with them at all times because they are still beta testing the wristbands. she is all annoyed because apparently our 3 button wasn't working to enter her pin with (funny been working all day lady!) and so her husband decides he's just going to pay cash and I tell him the total. 

In the middle of me saying your total is 24 dollars the woman interrupts with ""you do have bags for these right?"" (No we don't we are a popcorn stand, we do provide handles for you to carry them with and they have lids) I tell her ""no unfortunately we don't but if you turn around and go to them they do""(literally its maybe 5 steps away there is a cart that sells merchandise stuff that has bags)  In the middle of that statement the crazy old bitch says ""are you fucking kidding me"" I just stare at her at this point she keeps rambling on about how ""fucking pissed she is that I don't have any fucking bags"" and that since I don't have any bags she will not be buying them, knocks one of them on the ground and walks away.

   So to start things off, it's important to know that 95% of the employees on the golf course dip (if unfamiliar, it's like chewing tobacco, but you don't chew it, you just let it sit in your lip.) I've never had a problem with giving a dip to a friend if they've run dry, but one employee NEVER has his own supply, and it's quite annoying to feed his addiction. To make matters worse, he has gotten to where he just takes pinches from my can of Copenhagen without asking me (I don't keep my can in my pocket because it can get uncomfortable at times). If you're a dipper, you know what a pain that can be.
   After multiple attempts of telling him to cut that out, he still continues his thievery. So I devised a simple, yet effective plan. I brought two cans of dip to work: one empty and one full of sweet tobacco. Whenever I would finish a dip, I'd put it in the empty can instead of throwing it in the trash. Eventually, the empty can filled up with nice, already used dip. So I left it out where the employee (I'll call him Bob) could see it. 
   I noticed Bob had a nice fat dip in his lip. I checked, and sure enough, the can filled with my saliva tainted dip was about half empty. He'd been using it. Marvelous. 
I asked him how his dip was. 

""It tastes different man, it's less bold than it usually is.""

To which I replied: ""oh yea? That's because that can was full of re-dips. So you basically just had my mouth in yours.""

""Dude that's so nasty!"" Replied Bob. 

""I told you not to take my dip.""

He was chalk white. I thought he was going to throw up. Maybe that'll teach him to buy his own dip, and stop stealing out of my can.

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

Toni-Cipriani,11,,7,1r6mbw,,30,"This isn't so much a tale as it is something I've been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent 

I work for a small independent corner/liquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the area.

I have worked for retail chains too, namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain.  

Some pros I've been noticing are that working for an independent store:

-Much more laid back on certain things, have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please. Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have ""tabs"" when they are short on money

-Smaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful. 

-I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond, but it's more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers. Don't have to worry about things like returns, etc

-I  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop. 

-I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeks.


A few cons I've picked up on:




-The owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every 2 days pretty much

-No benefits like health coverage or anything

-No holidays off, only 4 people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stone.

-Realistically speaking I probably have alot less job security,  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel I'm well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly. 

My work doesn't have things like ""write ups"" it's what the owner wants at the end of the day. 

-This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop, but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have. I'd probably have to either ignore it or leave, people close to the owner are essentially untouchable I'd imagine.

 Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope. ",Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain?,37,talesFromRetail

Gimick,8,,11,1r0n8k,,28,"I work at an office/warehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving. We are technically a distributor, so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases, but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture, we also answer calls about defective merchandise. 

In the industry I work in, almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we make/distribute. We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise, where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund. Fine. It's no big deal, we usually just replace it. 

I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product. I go through the motions to make sure it's not just some kind of user error, and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem. She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new one.

I ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address. Well, naturally I have to ask about it. It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well. It is odd, but not unheard of, so I let it go.

After I get the information I need to process the replacement order, I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product. At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two. Hmm.

I assume she meant her daughters order, and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order, and that both would arrive on the same day. She corrected me, telling me that is not what she meant.

She then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with. I try to figure out why, which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she bought.

I repeatedly try to get her back on track, as I would rather not dally on the phone all day. Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves two.

Apparently instead of calling when her item broke, she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item. It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement, but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item. That is speculation, of course.

Either way, she felt since she bought a second item (which works perfectly, according to her), I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new, less expensive one. 

I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people, but to me, the math is off. Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her, as she purchased the item through a retailer, we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situation.

Am I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base? Is this sort of compensation common in other industries?

I work at a big-box retail store, specifically in the Electronics and Wireless phones department. And while there are stories galore I can talk about (and I may in the future), there is one I need to tell you all about now. This one customer used to come in on a regular basis and shop, then scream and yell at employees claiming that they are stealing from her and cheating her. Mind you, the police have been called in on a few occasions and have even had to subdue her on at least one occasion for trying to start a fight. This becomes even funnier when you know what she looks like: early 60's and about 5' tall: the small spitfire type. 

Anyways, during the past year she has come in and not started a screaming match with my management team, but her store visits have gotten, in the words of Alice, ""curiouser and curiouser"". The last time she came in I was resetting our new release DVD shelving to make way for the next day's releases with my co-worker ""Josie"". In comes the customer and stands 10 feet away from me and ""Josie"". She calls to us: ""Excuse, please; you help me? Now? Now?"" I look over to her, mutter a few choice words under my breath, and ask ""who, me?"" ""Yes, yes. Come, quickly..."" So I get up, say a little prayer, and come over. 

ME: What can I help you with today?

HER: Can I ask you a question?

ME: Sure! What did you need?

HER: Are you sure I can ask? (Motions over to ""Josie"") Can she hear us?

ME: (Confused) Um, no. She can't hear us. What did you need?

HER: (Leaning in, uncomfortably close) Are you both crazy people?

ME: Uhhhhh..... No?

HER: Are you sure? You sure you no crazy people?

ME: No; I'm not crazy, she's not crazy.

HER: Oh. OK. Here's my question...

And proceeds to ask me the same question about her phone for the next half hour; I answer in every way possible besides making puppets and acting it out, and eventually getting her phone company's tech support on the line to help me out. After she grabbed the phone from my hand and began gabbering on and on to the guy on the phone, she left; not really happy about the answer she got. When I picked the phone back up, the guy on the other end sounded like he needed a cigarette break and told me in no uncertain terms that I was correct in my explanation and that, if she doesn't heed our advice, she may get a disconnection notice very soon because she didn't listen.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Eventually they stopped hiring felons after they hired someone fresh out of county jail and she tried to unionize the store &amp; start riots against the managers.
There were a few winners that stick out in my mind from the 3 years I was  there while in high school &amp; college.
One lady was a dominatrix/ordained minister &amp; she hung up clothes at a thrift store. She always hit on the younger guys...like high school/college kids that worked there and that were customers. She was in her 40s, and looked like she had a lot of bad botox done to her face. She would have days where she would be depressed &amp; one of my friends tried to make her feel better &amp; she yelled in the aisle ""I WAS ONCE RAPED IN FRONT OF MY TWO SONS."" She used to work with part time crew (so basically the college/h.s. kids, some of them being underaged) &amp; she would pick up random stuff in the store &amp; tell the guys how it could be a sex toy. For example she picked up a flyswatter, said it's the Texas Flyswatter, pretended to slap one of the guys in the ass &amp; said ""What's your number?"" She wasn't allowed to work with us after that &amp; eventually got fired.


This one lady was straight up disgusting. She was in her late 20s, early 30s &amp; looked like she was 16. I'm not 100% sure if she was on drugs, but overall she looked pretty cracked out. She always started drama. For instance, one time she wanted other employees fired so she smeared her shit on the bathroom wall &amp; tried to blame it on other employees. Apparently her plumbing stopped working in their apartment so they shit in buckets &amp; poured it on the floor when she &amp; her family got evicted. Her kid was always sick. When she got fired from the thrift store she got hired at the local bakery...



There was a creepy man that was known as the ""shoeman"" because he handled the shoes. He was missing teeth &amp; always hit on all the women that worked there. He always made me uncomfortable. He would be hammered while on the clock half the time. I remember when we added a charity to our store, people from the charity came and had a little party to promote their charity. The shoeman was pretty wasted and shouted stuff at the heads of the charity during their presentation. He eventually got fired &amp; arrested for stealing from the woman who smeared shit on the wall's purse.
There was a lot of drugged out people in general. People coked out &amp; pill poppin like crazy. One lady used to smash a 40 oz on her break in her car &amp; do lines off her steering wheel. Another lady, who worked there for like a week, used to ask the employees if they were drug addicts. She used to be like, ""I love drugs: coke, PCP, oxycotton, you name it."" 


One lady just topped them all. We called her Crazy Cari. She was in her 40s &amp; worked with all the high school//college kids part time. She didn't do shit, I hated her on busy days. But she was pretty batshit insane. She used to come into work fucked up all the time. Our manager lived in the same apartment complex as her dealer I guess. Crazy Cari would look in her windows for her when she was all fucked up. She once came into work and was like ""I took a Xanax bar &amp; I just drank an energy drink to reverse it."" She used to just walk up and down the aisles looking confused, barely cleaning up. We called her ""Peanut"" in the beginning because we found her hiding in the production room of the store eating peanuts. Her first week, she fell asleep in a rocking chair that was on the sales floor towards the end of her shift. I couldn't comprehend why the kept her besides entertainment purposes because she was so crazy. She used to talk to the high school girls about how beautiful ballsacks were and she confided in one of the girls that the shoeman came over to her apartment and basically raped her. One of our supervisors wouldn't schedule her a lot because she would always slack off. Crazy Cari would come in &amp; yell at her saying all this random shit like ""My mom's gonna die &amp; I'm alone."" We met her mom, she was fine. She was never alone when she came to visit, she always had gross looking drugged out men with her. We brought this to the attention of the manager because she was threatening towards to the supervisor &amp; employees. He ignored us. She eventually got fired...for firing a gun at the stuffed animals.

I work in a printing store. It's also a small store so we don't have many staff members. 

There are two people who come in who always create a ruckus, take up a bunch of space while ordering their prints, and generally become an annoyance. When they pick up their prints, they will show us old emails or old print outs of promotions and expect us to give it to them for that price. They have done this to ever single employee in the store as well. 

Today, they came in to order some products. There was one that was on sale a week ago, but the sale ended. After ordering it, (actually submitting the order through so it makes it a hassle to cancel) they came up to me and said that the total was too expensive. Not to ask about the price or anything, just to tell me it was **too expensive** and it was cheaper last month, and to give them the price from last month. When I told them that was not possible since the sale was over, they insisted on showing me the email saying it was discounted. When I pointed out the ""ends on"" date, they insisted that the manager said that they could have the price. 

I have a really great manager who doesn't mind us calling them if we need help on the weekends. So I do, and I explain the situation. They said no, and also that they had to pick up their order today that they had previously ordered. 

I'm not sure where else to add it, but I'll tell the story of the nicknamed ""promotion order"" now. We had a promotion going on for a certain size of product. They ordered a bunch of the wrong size, and then said that they made a mistake. When they ordered it, I had gone up to them a couple times to tell them what the promotion was for, and how to change the sizes to the right one. They dismissed me (rudely, might I add) every single time, telling me they knew what size they were getting. So when it comes time to pick up, they tell me that they picked the wrong size and it was my fault because I should have told them. Then they demanded they get the prioducts for that price because it was smaller than what the promotion was for Sorry bud, doesn't work that way. 

So back to today, I tell them that they need to pick up all their products today. It's been a few weeks. So I ring it through, and again I get a giant hissy fit in my face. They're screaming when there's a bunch of other customers in the store that it's not fair and basically insinuating that it's our fault they can't afford everything. Then they also started yelling at us because they had forgotten something of theirs in the store, we could not find it, so we should reimburse them. (It's not our fault you forgot something *two weeks* ago and now it's gone missing.) After my co-worker calmed them down, they went back to ordering more products.

Then I have to hunt down a key to unlock it for her. Then it all has to be tax-exempted, because it‚Äôs a church. And she has a price match on one of those tiny pill cutters.

She wants to pay with a check. Nobody ever pays with a check anymore. So I have her fill it out and by some miracle, find the correct feed slot. 

READ ERROR. 

READ ERROR.

I call for help-I put the check wrong side up. I apologize.  I hear the customer swear.

I give her the receipt and she stomps off, complaining that I didn‚Äôt double bag her stuff. I‚Äôm behind now, so I practically scream a greeting/apology at the next customer. 

‚ÄúDo you want this in a separate bag?‚Äù I ask, and point to the whole, dripping, chicken.

 No response. Nice. I just do it anyway. 

I finish scanning the items, press ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù and look up at the customer, asking for their payment.

He‚Äôs blind. He has those glasses and a white cane. Holy sh*t.

The previous customer is waiting for her friend in the restrooms, and she walks back by me on her way out the door. 

‚ÄúSometimes you‚Äôve got to appreciate the small things,‚Äù she says by way of apology.

I finish the order and turn off the light. 

TL DR: Rude customer put in her place by blind customer?

ixiduffixi,4,,3,1r5xvj,,24,"So I was reading through another user's lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own. 

In my teenage years, my first job was working for the ""blue vest mafia."" My job description was something along the lines of ""Customer Service Specialist,"" which amounted to cart pusher, cashier, stockman, and basic maintenance. Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader. This tale involves one of those nights. 

When I worked on unloading my shift started at 3 p.m. We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse. The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver, and driven around the building to the warehouse. There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside. The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrance's sidewalk. This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door. This most commonly took place during store hours. (Not all of them are 24hrs.) Any way on to the story.

One day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock. This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour. Then the forktruck didn't return. I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse. When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight. I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off. The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone. I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer. They had apparently been talking for quite some time, because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office. When I asked what happened, my coworker got very, very upset. To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area. 

What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down. The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance. Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it. I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hours.

**BONUS STORY**

Another tale of the blue vest mafia. 

One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink, giggling, while his friend was in the stall also giggling. I took my time using the restroom, waiting them out, which eventually worked. While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something. 

After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies, sinus medication, and dvds. I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras. The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didn't stop until they were well outside. We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids.

ScaldingSoup,5,,5,1rha57,,27,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

SPAZZEH,10,,4,1reybf,,22,"Well, our store/chain was running a promotional for members who had the upgraded membership. When I got to work, I was able to see a line of 15 people waiting outside the front door. By the time we were able to open the front door (30 mins later), a crowd of 50-70 people ran through the front doors. I wasn't able to get to the safety gap fast enough, so instead I had to run from the crowd to a safely open area to avoid being trampled. I honestly haven't ever seen TV's and Electronics being bought left and right like that. EVER. We sold over 50 tvs in just the first hour (we also had to bring about 4-5 pallets of TV's down just so we wouldn't be out of stock on the floor.).

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

dichotomies,9,,29,1r2lgs,,18,"Here‚Äôs a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank (not BoA). It happened several years ago. 


The story starts about a week prior in a dream. I rarely remember my dreams, but this one stuck out to me. I remembered many details, from how things were said, and the feelings expressed. I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream; it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up. 


Fast forward to ‚Äútoday.‚Äù I sit down and help a 20 something customer (‚ÄúJohn‚Äù) who is sorting out his dad‚Äôs accounts. John‚Äôs dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas. A semi plowed into him. As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it. But, moving on. We have paperwork to do. I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department (I faxed it to them). As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son (John) and daughter (‚ÄúSarah‚Äù) beneficiaries (POD = payable on death). This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank. After having the death certificate approved by the legal department, and verifying John‚Äôs ID, I start to talk to John about his dad‚Äôs accounts. I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks, ‚Äúone made out to each of you.‚Äù 


Now, this is before smartphones and he doesn‚Äôt have the number for his sister on his phone. I think it was because she had just moved or something. John had an address book with him and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs in here. Let me take a look.‚Äù


It was at this point that it all clicked into place for me. It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open. I knew, for at least the next minute, exactly what was going to happen. I have never had this sensation before, or after. Normally I get this feeling after something happens (d√©j√† vu). This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyes.


He looks through his address book and can‚Äôt find his sister‚Äôs number. A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things, or where he wrote things down, so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number. I have to bite my lip to not say anything. I KNOW that his sister‚Äôs number is right in his address book. I am so confident that I want to say, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs in there. Look again.‚Äù I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son, bereaving the unexpected death of his father. John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit, then looks again in his address book. He finds it this time. 


I honestly can‚Äôt remember why we needed to call her (this was about 10 years ago), but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterday.


As I told this story you might have been thinking, ‚ÄúBut this sounds trivial and minor, what gives?‚Äù Well, I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough, and I knew it while I was experiencing it. That is kinda freaky. 


I am an agnostic, and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open. Just thought that I‚Äôd share with you guys. Thanks for reading.

So this is more of a question than a tale. It's my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards. 




I work in a corner store in the south. A guy comes in and wants to put 300$ on a Green Dot card. He gives me a handful of 20$'s that reeks of weed. No biggie. I don't care where you get your money. I ring him up. Have a nice day. 




He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesn't work. I try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong. I again try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. And let me just say now that he was very, very ""southern"" so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too. 




I go to lunch and when I get back he's walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because ""I obviously don't have any money since this card screwed me over"". I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store.  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check. I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that I'm glad they'll fix it for him. He walks back to his car and I think ""gee, that's a pretty expensive car for a for a guy who's barely 20"".  But whatever. Lucky guy I guess. But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot. 





Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot. He comes back in and gets another 300$ Green Dot since the other one was bad. I don't understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesn't have money for cigs. But I don't ask questions cuz I'm new to this job and I just do what I'm told. He buys it and leaves. And then sits in the parking lot for another hour. I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes. I think that maybe he's just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I don't want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed. (I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid).  




Well. The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at 150$ a piece. But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they aren't together. I'm just really weirded out because they're acting like they don't know each other. Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour. I don't mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldn't worry about it. 





The guys leave. I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because there's a green dot limit. 




So....what was this guy doing?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

copisreallybad,4,,8,1rhulb,,19,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

tl;dr - guy returns 3 year old can of frozen paint, manager gives him free shit, hambeast from receiving thinks that we can still sell it, paint department head saves the day.  ",i work at a home improvement store that sells paint (among other things),27,talesFromRetail

I work at an artist's market where we sell screen printed baby clothes and T-shirts. When we print our shirts, we buy wholesale of a certain color and print about 50 shirts with the same color ink on that bunch of same colored shirts. Pretty basic concept.

Everyday somebody will ask me if we have the shirt they like in a different color or with different ink.

I don't understand why people ask me this, because if I had that color I would obviously have it out so people can buy it. I never think to ask that whenever I am at a store.

Greenwallets,10,,6,1r52ex,,15,"Hey guys. So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company. Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer, which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space. 

The issues we're experiencing, largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there. They're most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time (benefits, base pay + commission) as the assistant manager for this new employer.  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks, and I've had associates/managers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer. In a tone that makes it feel as though I have ""betrayed"" them in some way. 

I know it's jealousy from the associates, but it's affecting our relationship with the retailer. There's a very distinct ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us. We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isn't buying a cellular device or related accessory. Specifically, there is one associate who has made rude comments about my manager(s) and I in our vicinity, in addition to physically trying to walk through me. I should mention she did this when I worked there as well- she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there. Did I mention she's 28?

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment, and how you went about rectifying the situation. I should say that my manager isn't likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role. She's also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer. She's too much of a sweetheart, I'm a cynical realist when it comes to this store.",(Meta) how do you deal with a toxic work environment?,21,talesFromRetail

Itorres89,3,,8,1r3iy4,,15,"So I'm working for a big box retail store. We just recently got a new-ish store manager. He was originally an assistant store manager but they put him in charge of another store in our city (I say ""put in charge"" because he wasn't put through STORE management training until AFTER that store closed down) and then transferred to our store as our old a$$hat of a manager got himself transferred cross country.

Anyway, this guy comes in, seems nice enough but he's barely been at our store a week and he's already drastically changing things. I've been at that store for about 4 years, he's been with the company about 2. He hasn't directly wronged me yet but he's developing a bit of a rep with the other associates for favoritism. Things are chaos. People don't even know what they'll be working for ~~Black Friday~~ yet. I'm supposed to be on the ""softlines"" side, but I'm working ""hardlines.""

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

TaterSaladDelta,9,,8,1re9xa,,12,"  OK, so this is basically the climax of my time at the tent. The next two stories aren't quite as grand but they are funny. 

  So this was a few years ago now, way back when I first started helping at the tent. We were sitting around, eating some greasy takeout from the chinese place in the shopping complex we were stationed in front of, when we saw him. 

  He came in skipping, he owned the place. His real name was fairly normal so my brother nicknamed him Tyrone. This kid was...interesting. First off he wasn't the best dressed. OK, I understand that not everyone can afford fitting clothes, his shirt was huge, his shorts were well...short, and his flip flops were a few sizes too small. Whatever, I don't judge.

  He was kind of dirty and looked like he needed a good hosing. This was forgivable, kids get dirty, and some don't have access to showers, I get it.

  *Then I saw the hat.*

  It was a flashy, hot pink. Add a layer of sparkly rhinestones. Then the centerpiece, a cutout of Miley Cyrus. This was Hannah Montana era cyrus. *Premium shit.* 

  The hat was ok. If he likes the queen of Disney, more power to him. But HE WAS SINGING SONG AFTER SONG AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS **HOLY SHIT** I mean maybe if his singing was good but no, it was painful. 

  So after watching him wander the tent for a few laps (yes, he went around at least 20 times) I noticed something. He was behaving oddly. Not shifty like he was going to steal something but....like a girl.

  He would do the usual ""Nyugh I'm soo hawt"" walk that girls sometimes do, the floppy hand, the rest all your weight on one leg/hip move, he missed not one nuance of the female behavior. I was astounded. To my narrow 13 year old mind, he was gay. The gay of the gays. Now I'm not so sure but then, I was convinced. 

  My brother and his friend were convinced too but they were so bored being in there constantly for 11 days that anything was cause for immediate judgement.

  So fast forward to checkout, he swaggers up to the table and makes his payment. He smacks his gum and pulls out a Miley Cyrus wallet. I know you shouldn't judge anyone but c'mon, I couldn't help but think ""what-what is he doing with...oh my""(-ley cyrus...heh)

  He then lingered for about an hour and pole danced on our tent supports. Yeah, I'm not really going to explain that one. He didn't do too much after that but he's been coming every year since then (about 3 or 4 years now) and he's lost the girl mannerisms and Miley swag, but he still compulsively lies about stuff.

  Antwon wasn't as crazy, he was just a short, portly little guy with a 70's porn stache that followed Tyrone around on his schwinn bicycle. He rides it to and from the tent every year and I see him all year around, and he's always on that bike. You'd think he would get skinnier, right? I mean he always is riding. Well, no. He just gets bigger. But it's ok, everyone loves Antwon.

  I actually do feel bad for Tyrone because he doesn't have a whole lot. I was actually inspired by him, he left me with a better understanding of the other side of life. I saw the way kids like him have to compromise, they have to use what they have to make ends meet, and they're happy doing it. He had access to a Miley Cyrus hat and sequin-encrusted wallet and damnit he was fabulous. 

  Wherever you are Tyrone, you've helped me see *the best of both worlds.*

BreakfastWithReddit,13,,18,1rcwf1,,12,"This is my first post here and as you can read my flair, I work fast food part-time and I've been working here for the past 4 months. While this story may not be about my boss or any customers, I just want to share with you how my coworker (we'll call here Sarah to protect her identity) has irritated me so much since I started working here.
So here I am, an 18 year-old male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month, I have to work the drive-thru by using the headset to take orders, making drinks, and making desserts, sometimes all at the same time. My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up. Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same time.

Meanwhile, Sarah is working the window, only transacting the money, credit cards, etc. and handing our customers their food. Quite obviously, I have a bigger job than her and as a human, I can make mistakes or be slow at times, but it's only to provide the same, excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset. For example, I might miss the chance to make the earlier customer's drinks while I am taking the previous customer's order. For a few seconds of making the drinks, delivering them, and apologizing for the wait, customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset (they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headset).

Now insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job. If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and they're waiting on me to make their drinks, I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset. While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customer's order. It can be hard at times for me because I really don't want to screw up the drink by letting the soda, tea, or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons, the liquid would spill out of the top. This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently, Sarah hates when I make mistakes like this.

She will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time, but I really want to tell her that maybe I don't want the drink to overflow or maybe that I don't want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I don't want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldn't hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me. It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask him/her again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed tone.

There were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer I'm taking an order from. When this happens, the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation. Sarah would have to ask for a manager's card to change the order at the window and then she would death-stare me as if I stepped on her iPhone. I really can't say what I feel against her because I'm working on the headset which is on 90% of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldn't want to say anything I could regret. It just makes me mad because I'm doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there, doing her window job and yelling at me when I can't finish a drink for a few seconds. She doesn't even help me finish my drinks, which would be nice, but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand, waiting for a cup to snatch. She always takes the cup right out of my hand (even when it's not done) so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her. It makes me so mad that she doesn't even lend a hand and she just stands there, being so ignorant of me while I work 3 jobs and her job only takes 15 seconds.

I'm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same, quality respect everyone else deserves. Before she started bitching at me, I tried to interact with her while we're on breaks, but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her. She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions, so I stopped, seeing that I can't break the wall that is her selfishness.

**This post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah, but here is the part that you've probably been waiting for (I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situation).**

It was 8:30 pm tonight and my shift was going to end at 9:00 pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken. I had to make a quick large-size Diet Dr. Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, wheat bun, and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich, which had me pressing a lot of buttons. At this point, it seemed that Sarah had enough of my ""dawdling"" and she finally decided to help me finish the drink, which was still fizzing at the top. I wanted to make sure the customer didn't get cheated for an under-filled large drink and I didn't want it to spill at the same time, but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr. Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker, she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform. She quickly looked away and went back to her post, acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage. I wanted to shout profanities, kick and scream at her, but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car, in complete shock of what happened. My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom. I was shaking in rage and the cold, wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up. My shift ended when I exited the restroom. I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home, still smelling of Dr. Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheel.

TL;DR Sarah, my coworker, has some kind of a bad grudge against me and I don't know why. After repeatedly telling me to hurry up with the drinks I was making, she finally decided to help me for the first time to finish a large Diet Dr. Pepper and she spilled the entire drink on me and she did not take responsibility for it.",My coworker is a terrible person,30,talesFromRetail
Endrealis,3,,4,1rged9,,13,"I think it's okay to post here. I work at a recycling center which is a bit different than retail but I deal with the same stuff. 

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,3,1rigon,,20,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,3,1rie8h,,20,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

peskymuggles,0,,1,1rimmj,,15,"I had a short-lived retail career at a popular Canadian coffee chain.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go. I had to stand there awkwardly while begging with my eyes to be saved by my coworkers, but they certainly weren't going to put an end to their amusement any earlier than necessary.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,2,1riony,,14,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that‚ÄîI don't put up with that sort of BS‚Äîthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it‚Äîwith an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three ‚Äì Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before ‚Äì I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above ‚Äì watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring ‚Äì the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often ‚Äì the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition ‚Äì he was going to steal!  ‚ÄúOh shit here we go, ‚Äù I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies ‚Äì a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

‚ÄúNo way...is he really going to...‚Äù I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out ‚ÄúWoop woop woop woop!‚Äù loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

RetailQueen,8,,12,1reqkf,,0,"So tonight we had our annual holiday kick-off meeting and instead of getting me excited for holiday and all of the great things that come with it in retail, it made me want to come home and kill myself. 
Honestly, I LOVE working retail an I LOVE My job, but I honestly think this year my boss just hired the first people who came into the store and were looking for a job. I have never ever in my 6 years of working retail seen more incompetent employees in my whole life. 
First off, I'm the one in charge of training most of them, and by the way, I'm still pretty new at this job. I've only been there for about 5 months, but I guess because I'm able to catch on so quickly, and I have commen sense and know how to do things, I have to be punished by putting up with a million questions, and even more blank stares. 
Anyway, I thought I'd share some of the questions that were asked at tonight's meeting, an the responses I was giving silently in my head as I just sat there with my hea in my hands. So here you go. 
-""what we get for free though?""-first of all, learn how to speak proper English. Secondly, YOU are a seasonal employee, if you want something free, you have to earn it....shocking I know, considering by the way you're talking you've probably never had to do that for anything before. 
-""so, do we get here early or...""-hon, it's Black Friday, but no..I think you should continue the streak you have going on and show up 30 minutes late with some ridiculous excuse. P.S. I REALLY hope you don't come in after me , because if I have to wait for you to get here before I can leave my 9 hr shift I can't be responsible for what might happen to you. 
-""what do we do if a customer tells is that the price of something should be different than what it is?""-contrary to popular belief, the REGISTER is always right, not the customer. 
-""if we are supposed to work before we open, how do we get inside the store?""-I don't know, but you may want to try the door? Just a suggestion. Now that comment I actually did say out loud, and I cracked up after I said it, but just got a ton of blank stares..I guess no one else thinks I'm funny, and she proceeded to ask ""but what if the customers run us over when we open the door?"" -we work at a specialty clothing store. It's not like we are selling cheap TVs or anything anyone actually wants. No customers are going to act THAT crazy for a free tote bag.

lvroye01,6,,15,1redbg,,0,"So, I go into my local National Chain grocery store, where everybody knows me, and knows I like my bourbon.

The house brand is decent enough, and cheap enough to buy regularly without feeling like I have to take out a loan.

The store has house brands of scotch and Canadian as well, and they all have similar label designs, but with different label colors, mine is red. This detail is important. They also come in two sizes, Small (750ml), and Large (1.75L).

It is well known to all, that I only buy the Small bottle, because, well... ""The big one gets me in trouble..."".

One of the younger cashiers was helping out bagging groceries, and asked if I wanted ""my usual"". I said ""Yes please"", and off she went to the locked cabinet to retrieve it.

""Lvroye01 we only have the Large bourbon in today, we're out of the small"", says she.

""That's ok, my dear, scotch or even canadian will do."" says me.

""I'm not sure I know what those are..."" plaintively says she.

Older guy cashier doing the checkout says, ""The one on the bottom shelf with the purple label.""

Her: ""I still can't find it.""

Me: ""Ok, I'll come look""

OGC: ""Never mind, I'll get it"", and goes and retrieves my evening's golden elixir.

Well they ended up on having half, so they went and would bring one item at a time back to my register to ring up. Customers started leaving my line until one stayed. C kept running back and forth until C had met the amount. For some reason C had 4 dollars left and though 2 packs of hotdogs hamburger and bacon was worth four dollars, but beside that, I processed their charge slip and they had 1$ left over. Well they wanted to use EBT to pay that and the total went back up from a dollar to beyond the hundreds.

metamaxwell,386,,383,1r14xk,,1115,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

I don‚Äôt speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish).

I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

I walked up them smiling and said, ‚ÄúBastardo barato, get out.‚Äù

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

Not_A_CEO,180,,223,1rdpxf,,905,"Here's a relatively short tale today, folks.

I've posted here a few times before, and it should bear mentioning that I'm a bank teller and have been for 5+ years.  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a Teller.

I had gone through the mandatory 30-day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors, and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank.  I was technically under the 90 day Probationary stage, but for all intents and purposes I was a full-fledged employee.  Two weeks go by, and I'm steadily getting more and more comfortable.  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes, until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pants.

A customer walks in, hands me his $800 payroll check, and says he'd like to deposit it into his account.  *All right, no problem, here's your receipt, have a nice day.*  He leaves, and that's that.  Or so I thought.  About 10 minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says, ""Hey, Not_A_CEO, did you help this guy a few minutes ago?""

When I acknowledge that I did, in fact, help him with this deposit, my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guy's account and to tell him if I noticed anything ""off.""  So I did...and immediately noticed something wrong.  There's a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current day--I can see if he's been to the grocery store, a gas station, or if he's made any deposits.  Sitting in the Deposit section is...wait for it...a deposit made 10 minutes ago for the nice little sum of $100,000,000.  With my teller signature on it.

Read that sentence above again for me, would you?

**I deposited one hundred million dollars into this guy's account when it only should have been $800 dollars.**

Noticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket, and the words *Ohshitohshitohshit* start to fly about in my mind.  I'm currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me.  He affectionately calls me an idiot, and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount (which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that point).

Turns out, I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section, which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited.  Management thought it was hilarious, and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix, but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on me.

Yesterday was one of days when the technicians go around disconnecting anyone who owes over three months of bills, and I had the joy of being one of the reconnections desks dealing with the hundreds of pissed off people that had been cut off. There were a lot of idiots among them, but one guy really stood out. He came up to my window, told me his power was shut off and that he couldn't find the bills to bring with him.

Me: No problem, do you have your meter number?

Him: No.

Me: Ok then, what's your address?

Him: Two blocks from the San Miguel church on route 2, the road with the petrol station.

Me: I need to know the name of the road and the house number.

Him: Well most people call it *random nickname related to the petrol station*.

Me: But what does the city call it?

Him: It's 'Sargeant something'.

Me: Yeah, I can't do anything unless I have the bill, the meter number or the address. Could you go and call someone at the house, have them tell you the meter number and then re-join the queue?

He wasn't pleased about having to queue all over again, but went off to call whoever. Eventually he works his way back down the line, reappears at my window and reads the number off his phone:

Him: It's 1754 and the last number is either 2 or 3.

Me: What?

Him: She says the wheel for the last number is turned halfway between 2 and 3.

Me: That's not the meter number. That's the number that tells you how much electricity you've used. The meter number is nine digits and it's on the grey sticker underneath where it says ""meter number"".

I got an evil-glare from him as he went off to find out the actual number and queue for a third time. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him on his final visit to the windows, but my colleague did. He managed to get the correct number and pay what he owed, but got angry when she told him his power would be back ""within 24 hours"". He snapped at her that he had eight chickens in the fridge that were all going to go bad if he wasn't reconnected immediately, and that he's going to write a formal complaint to the company about both of us and to demand some kind of recompense for the chickens.

AAEmmerson,76,,100,1r7jes,,646,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about ¬£4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

TL:DR Man wastes lots of grilled sandwiches, starts cussing us out, we get him thrown of his flight for aggressive behavior. All for a bacon sandwich.

today after she is done with her shopping, she comes up to my register. she has about 10 pairs of shoe laces, a pair of pants and asks me to get some of the stuff she put on hold. the stuff she put on hold the day prior was not properly put away and went back on the sales floor. she proceeds to have an absolute fit and starts speaking under her breath in another language. 

the next thing she does is whip out her cell phone, which i mind you did not ring (she always pretends to talk on her phone as on an official call) and she answers, ""This is Dr. So-and-So WHAT DO YOU WANT? NO. I TOLD YOU ALREADY. IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST, YOU'RE NOT GETTING SURGERY.""

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,566,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

diinomunster,71,,107,1rcku1,,391,"Hello my lovelies. I had a wonderful 4p-8a shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas station/C-Store. (I'm a softy who just can't say no). This offense happened around 2am. 

Now my gas station is in a really dumb place. We're in the main Highway of our city which is why we're a 24/7 store, but we're in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I don't see much traffic between midnight and four am. That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us. (Somewhere because there's a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart, a pizza Hut, a burger restaurant, a funeral home [yeah idk either], and then the bar is somewhere in that mess). 

So anyway between 130 &amp; 230 I get a nice hour of drunks. Our local police force is always really nice. They know that it's either me (5'3"" 115lbs female) or J (scrawny, but seriously awesome, little white guy) working alone. I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic. The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store. (I seriously give these guys so much free coffee). 

The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had, fresh out of the Academy. Super nice guy. Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss (we get them fresh every day so they aren't dried out if they were bagged) and thanked them when they said they'd be keeping an eye out for me. Around 150ish they had nabbed a drunk driver (yay team!) and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street. 

Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout (I'm on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit). The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store. When you walk in there's the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right, coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall. You have to walk around to your right, following the counters, to leave through the exit door. This is so you can't sneak out behind us and steal something. 

Queue 2am. I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy who's browsing our snack food quietly. In comes this super drunk middle aged black male. He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall (it's about 4.5 feet high). He will be Drunk Guy (DG). 

DG: Hey! How much for a cab to Menomininity? (I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us). 

Me: I'm not sure. We can call a cab and ask. Do you have a certain cab company you like to use? 

DG: just look some numbers up for me on the Internet. 

Me: I don't have the Internet here. I have a phone book though you can borrow. 

Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for. 

DG: NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK! 

Yeah... Okay? He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms. On his way he took out the fruit stand, the magazine rack, and the little employee break table in the hallway. 

Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom. ""That black guy grabbed me by the jacket, pulled me out of the stall, then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me."" 

Uhh.. What? 

The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit (despite me telling him he didn't have to because I have to throw it all away anyway) insists he'll stay until this guy leaves. 

Me: Yeah I don't have the time for this. I'm just calling the police. 

I get on the phone with none emergency, explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in. Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer. 

DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic.. And then he sees the officer. 

DG: AW THE FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCH!

the officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didn't fight. I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense. College kid dipped out at some point (I think he was underaged). A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as I'm talking to RideAlong for my statement. Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole. His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar. 

Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at 130 like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks can't hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster. They also haven't been letting the drunk patrons use their phone. For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone. Yeah. Screw them. 

DG got hauled off, I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up. The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation. I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders. 

I thankfully had last night and tonight off so I'll see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better. 

Well it's bed time. Sorry for the sleepy rambling. Good night TFR.

notanangel_25,44,,60,1rehs5,,387,"Hi TFR!  My first post as I've recently started at a big box electronics retailer for the holidays.  I'm no stranger to retail though as this will be my 3rd Black Friday, one year at a department store and the other at a toy store that went out of business.

Just a quick story about a customer from yesterday.  My department is right near the DVDs and we don't have any dedicated staff manning the DVD section so obviously if someone asks for help finding something whoever would just help them.  Anyway, a woman asks for help looking for a DVD.  We'll call her Clueless Woman (CW).

*CW:  Hi I'm looking for a DVD.*

*Me:  Sure what's the name of it?*

*CW: The Counselor.*

*Me: Let's go.  It sounds familiar, how long ago did it come out?*

We get to the DVD section and I begin looking for the movie.

*CW: Oh the end of last month.*

I stop looking and turn to her, 

*""You mean it's still in theaters?*

*CW: Yea, probably, so do you have it in stock?*

*Me: Um, typically movies are in theaters for a few months, maybe 3 months or so.  So the earliest you could possibly see a DVD for a movie that came out a month ago would be February or March.*

*CW:  Could you just check in the back?*

*I directed her over to a computer where I searched the item and showed her it didn't exist yet.  She proceeds to ask me about a TV show which is in it's first season on TV right now.*

*CW: So I also want the DVD for this show called Betrayal on ABC.*  

*Me: Sure.*  

Since I'm at the computer, I look to see if we have it.

*Me:  I'm sorry nothing's coming up. How many seasons does it have so far?*

*CW:  Um, I think 1.*

I end up googling it and find out it's currently on TV.

*Me:  Well the show is currently being aired on TV so there would be no DVDs available until the show is done.*  

*CW:  When will that be?*

*Me:  Well it depends if their season goes a full season or a half season.  Again you're talking the earliest March-ish and more likely the Summer or Fall.*

*CW:  Oh ok.  Can I watch it online?*

*Me: Sure you can watch it on ABC.com, or Hulu.com*

*CW:  But I don't have a computer.*

*Me: Well depending on your tv provider, you can maybe watch it free ondemand.  Or if you can access the internet through your TV or other device...*

*CW: How would I do that?*

*Me: Do you have wifi at home?*

*CW: So that means my TV can just connect?!*

*Me: Um, about how old is your TV?*

*CW:  I've had that old TV for years.  It might be as old as you, haha.*

Me:  Then no, you can't connect to the internet unless you have a another device like a gaming console or dvd player.*

*CW:  So... maybe I should just buy a tablet so I can watch it right?*

*Me:  Umm, that's an option...if that's what you want...*

*CW:  And I'll be able to watch the Counselor on there too right?*

*Me:* ****facepalm****  *Ma'am the movie is still in theaters, no DVD is going to come out until next year.  Even then it will take awhile before you'd be able to watch it online.*

*CW:  It's fine.  So tell me about the Nexus iPads.*

*Me:...*

I go through the whole spiel of showing her the different tablets and then she stops me mid-sentence and asks the price of the tablet I was telling her about even though it was right there in front of it.

*Me:  Well this tablet is actually on sale right now for $359.*

*CW:  What!?  That's too much money just to watch this movie.*  

Then she just walks out of the store.","""I'm sorry, what you're looking for doesn't exist yet""",447,talesFromRetail
calador,41,,87,1rdykp,,377,"In 2002, I worked for a national discount department store that had filed for bankruptcy. I was the Upfront Supervisor and worked the Customer Service desk. The company decided to close stores in waves. My store was in wave two. The closing did the usual ""Store Closing! X0% off! Everything Must Go!"" signs everywhere. In smaller print under this was the caveat ""All sales final. No exchanges or returns."" This was printed on the receipt and an employee stood at the door highlighting this line and repeating it verbally before thanking them for their business. 

We were about two months into the 3 month closing sale when this 30-something man who we will call DC comes in wearing nice clothes that obviously came from one of the high-end malls within a 20 minute drive of our store.

DC was carrying a box for an RC car. He drops it on the counter in front of me and asks for a refund. I apologize and tell him that I can't give him a refund as we were closing and all sales were final. I mentioned that the manufacturer's warranty was still valid and he could contact them for repair or replacement. He started getting upset. For five minutes or so, he proceeded to verbally harangue me and said that the reason our store was closing was ""poor customer service."" I tried in vain to calm him down as he got louder and more vulgar. Finally, I asked him to either quiet down or leave. He spoke right over me, telling me where to shove this broken RC car. I snapped. 

&gt;Me: Sir, I have repeatedly asked you to calm down. Unfortunately, all sales are final. We are closing. We have signs on all the support poles and every aisle in the store saying this. Your receipt says this. There is no excuse for you to come in here and harass me like this. Now, shut up or get the hell out of my store before I call security and the police to escort you in handcuffs for trespassing. 

&gt;DC: You can't talk to me like that! I am a Customer! The customer is always right! Where is your manager. I want to talk to them about this.

&gt;Me: Sir, I have waited 6 long years to say this to one of you pretentious pricks. Shut up! You are not always right. In this case, you are definitely wrong. I have told you several times that I can do NOTHING for you. Sure, I can get my manager here. They will tell you the same thing I have been trying to get past your perfectly styled thick hair. 

*I turn and point at the Hardlines Assistant Manager. She is biting her lips to keep from laughing out loud. I can hear the laughter in her voice as she tells her customer all sales are final and thanks for the business.*

&gt;In fact, she is standing right behind me at the register, ringing customers up and telling them exactly what I have been telling you. WE. ARE. CLOSING. So, what are they gonna do? FIRE ME?!? The store closes in a month. I and everyone here is losing their jobs already. Now. GET. THE. HELL. OUT. OF. MY. STORE!

*DC immitates a fish gasping for water for a moment before turning bright red.*

&gt;DC: You have not heard the last of this. I am calling your corporate office to complain.

*He leaves in a huff, forgetting his RC car. HLM, the manager I mentioned bursts into laughter. Through her teary hiccups, she turns and looks at me.*

&gt;HLM: How long has that been bottled up?

&gt;Me: 6 long years.

&gt;HLM: You hid it well. Glad you got it off your chest?

&gt;Me: Felt good.

At this point, DC comes back in, glares at me, and snatches his RC car off the counter. I merely smile and 
tell him to have a nice day and thanks for the business.

&gt;DC: F*** you, a******!

&gt;Me: Sorry, wouldn't want to dislodge that stick you have shoved up your backside. Bye!

Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

jessajuhanabi,30,,92,1rhnqp,,395,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

Jasonresno,8,,72,1r8zpa,,310,"After 5 years of slaving away at a job in retail (working my way up to management) while I studied and completed school I finally got to put my two week notice in. Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

So it's my last day of work and I've been relaxing and laughing with everybody. The phone rings.

Me (M), Customer (C).

M: Hello, this is XXXX. How can I help you?

C: Yeah. I see this product online. It's a XXX. Do you have one.

-It's not something we carry, exactly. I do have alternatives.

M: No, I'm sorry sir. We don't carry that line of products. I do have a---

C: You don't? What?

M: No, sir, we don't work with that company--

C: Seriously? You don't?

M: No, but I do have an alternative and --

C: Listen, kid, I've been buying from you guys for years. And every year you have less and less in your store. Why are you even open if you don't have what I want?

-I'm taken aback and instantly angry. I've gotten to the point where I don't react well to rude customers on the phone.

M: Due to a number of economic reasons we've focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves. It helps small companies like us stay competitive.

C: Really. Really? So you're telling me you just sell garbage?

-I pause in disbelief and just wait. The man is silent too.

M: Is there anything else I can help you with?

-Instantly angry he responds.

C: Apparently not since all you sell is trash. Really can you even

-And then I'm pretty much seeing red and I interrupt him. Sarcasm so thick I almost choked on it.

M: Yep. You're right sir. All we sell at my store is garbage. Nothing useful, just trash. Thanks for calling and please don't call back.

And then I hung up. Went over to my manager, explained what happened, and that was that. My boss didn't care. I'm done there. Feels good.","""So you guys pretty much only sell garbage now, right?"" or how I happily chewed out a customer on my last day of work.",382,talesFromRetail
Tufty89,32,,59,1rdse5,,289,"*This is a story from long, long ago, that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit. I thought you all might enjoy it.*

This happened a while ago, but it just popped into my head, so I'm gonna do my best to remember it.

I used to work nights on the checkout of a 24 hour supermarket. Now, in this particular store, there were certain things that you couldn't do on the checkout without a manager's key and a code, generally, anything that would change the total by more than ¬£2, including voiding items, would require you to call a manager.

Since we worked nights, they gave the key and the code to 2 women who worked on the cigarette kiosk, because they had worked there for a long time, there was always at least one of them working and they didn't want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake. All worked fine normally.

Until the day that neither of these women were in. Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area? Did they buggery.

There were 3 of us working that night, and the other 2 were quite new on the department. We did our best, but I was the first to go down. A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided. I put a call out for the on duty manager, then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes. The line wasn't very long, because it was getting quite late. There was a little grumbling, but everyone seemed fairly understanding.

5 minutes pass. I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY. I advise everyone to start going through the other 2 tills. I am starting to get worried, but we still have 2 tills running, so it's not the end of the world. The lines get longer.

Then, one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice. It happens, the scanners sometimes just glitch. The item cost more than ¬£2, and bam, 2 checkouts are locked down. I direct people through the lone surviving till. The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done. I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly. No answer. I call again. Nothing. I put another call out over the speakers. Apologise to all customers.

Then it happens. The last till goes down. Another double scan. The line is 15 people deep. And this is at midnight, when it's odd to have more than 1 customer at a time. I try to call the manager again. Nada. I call a team leader, explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager, any manager. I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain what's going on. I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness. Some fo them have been waiting for 20 minutes. I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isn't anything I could do. I wish there was something, anything I could do. We can't open any other tills. They are all shut down, and even if I had the key to turn them on, all of our log in's are locked into these tills.

Finally, someone saunters to the tills. They aren't a manager. They had been sent down by the on duty manager, because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator. I'm getting frantic. I send her back to find the manager.

Time passes. People have been waiting for over half an hour now, and you can imagine what that looks like. Thankfully, none of the customers are directing their anger at us, but they are all very, very angry.

Eventually, the manager turns up. All good right? Nope.

He takes one look at the scene. And walks away. The customer's see my face. Now they know what the manager looks like.

There is more of the same. Frantic phone calls, announcements over the speakers. Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later, the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd. The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me, it seems my pleas for forgiveness worked

The manager is barely listening to the poor people. He keeps interrupting them, trying to push blame off of himself. This was the first he had heard of the situation. Luckily, all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him. The manager eventually rolls his eyes, and wanders off to the office to pick up the keys.

A full 45 minutes after the last till went down, we finally got the code and unlocked the tills. Did the manager apologise to the customers? Nope. Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait? Nope. Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that? Take a guess.

As I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them. It wasn't much, but I would accept any coupon they had, even if they weren't for our store. I would ""accidentally"" mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off. If something wouldn't scan, I'd just pretend I hadn't noticed and give it to them. I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble, but I just didn't care at this point. When we cleared the line, I sent the other 2 girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it. When they were gone and I was sure I was alone, I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering. ",Cashier's Nightmare,348,talesFromRetail
blackaurora,20,,57,1r5trc,,292,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

genericname11,28,,45,1r72se,,279,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I‚Äôd much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being ‚Äúbacking‚Äù). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That‚Äôs why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it‚Äôs a land yacht. It‚Äôs being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it‚Äôs a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she‚Äôs going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

‚ÄúHey, you!‚Äù She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don‚Äôt register that she‚Äôs talking to me.

‚ÄúHey, cart guy!‚Äù She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

‚ÄúDo you ned help unloading?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNo. I want to know why you dented my car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working on the other side of the lot. I haven‚Äôt been in this area for a while.‚Äù

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. ‚ÄúYou left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?‚Äù

Ugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.‚Äù

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

‚ÄúYou have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe says you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? I‚Äôm not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. Be careful. I don‚Äôt want this happening again.‚Äù

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.‚Äù

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it‚Äôs bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

‚ÄúYou just totaled a $60,000 car!‚Äù

Now, I did not handle this well.

‚ÄúYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.‚Äù

Second rule of retail: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù It should not be, but it is.

‚ÄúI want to talk to a manager right now!‚Äù

Yuppie-Husband parks his ‚Äútotaled‚Äù car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: ‚ÄúThis kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?‚Äù

Side note: ‚ÄúTotaled‚Äù is short for ‚Äútotal loss‚Äù This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

‚ÄúLets discuss it in my office.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was ‚Äúmy turn.‚Äù

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don‚Äôt have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband‚Äôs fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

themonkeyone,39,,52,1r7frc,,260,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

Legionofclowns,54,,69,1rcc3t,,255,"First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones I've been reading on here. It's long so be forewarned. 

So it's 2006 and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis. I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt, working in the DVD/CD/Video Games area and had become one of the goto guys. The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday; we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everything.....hopefully. The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo, for this was the year of the Wii. 

Now before this i had worked with the public. Had worked at the movie theater, fast food, etc. but this was my first real retail job. I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the news.

Day comes and of course I'm there at open. I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see? A line that stretches from the door, goes around the store, comes back to the front doors, and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store. I think ""no big deal we got this."" We start handing out the tickets, before opening, for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the 30 Wiis we managed to have. And within 5 minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didn't get what and the standard bickering. Not worried, we have a cop outside keeping order. 

So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working, customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown. NOPE! 

Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of ""THEY HAVE EM!"" and ""I HAD IT FIRST BITCH!""  Going into ""oh shit"" mode I briskly jog (flat out run) to the bay and witness about 20 soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway, pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way, and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way. I mean seriously, how many times do you get to see a middle-class housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter?  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees. 

At this point I have to make a decision....do I (A.) Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or (B. ) Stop a possible murder. I go with B. and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP. I get into the bay and WHOOMP, I'm out. Don't remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor. Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system. 

At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying. When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me, but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC-10 at anything not wearing a uniform. The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure I'm alright (SPOILER: I didn't die) More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name (I'm humorous most of the time so I said Garfield, that's how they knew I was ok). I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash (still have the scar) I'm good, in fact I'm ready to go back to work. 

Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras.  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away. I've never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my 7th (although I'm with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazon.com wasn't a competitor, damn restructuring).

tl;dr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that I'm Edward James Olmos on a jetski.

So anyway, I am new at my work, and I am a casual at a Jeweler. This was my first job so I put up with most stuff I didn't really like as I didn't want to cock it up. I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise. For about another month, Karen the Boss, would walk around quoting the bible, telling us in private how god is present when we work and how he is the one making us an income (I never saw him working once in the store) and how we wouldn't have jobs without him...Mostly the usual Bible-Thumper stuff. This was all until I finally blew up, in front of customers...She questioned me why I never wear a Cross or St Christopher medallion and how as it was ""part"" of the dress code, I could be fired for not wearing it. I turned to her and told her my ""view"" on everything she said, she started yelling, threatening to fire me I ended up resigning on the spot and I walked out.

LIVES_IN_CANADA,108,,72,1rbn62,,243,"So I used to work for a large department store in the front-end (cash and customer service mainly). At our location we had 24 cash registers, 10 of which were express (10 items or less) and the other 14 were regular belts. We also had 6 self-checkout machines that were watched over by 1 cashier at a time. This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them. 

Now I don't remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was, but I do remember that it was very busy. We had every single register open and we still had lines of 3-6 people at each register. 

When I'm watching the self-checkouts I'm watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the 48-pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned. I also have to help people out when they have coupons as 95% of the time the machine doesn't recognize them, as well as any and all questions about their purchases/prices/payment methods. So basically I'm busy running around the whole time.

So this day, while I'm watching the self-checkouts, two women who were next in the seemingly never-ending line come to one of the machines nearest to me. One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women (I found out it was the pregnant women's mother). Nothing note worthy happens with them until they're at their last item. It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart. The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness (I think she said cancer). 

Now they choose to come to a self-checkout machine. A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out. They didn't think to wait in one of the 24 other lines where you'd have a dedicated cashier who'd be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you. No, they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watch/help 6 customers simultaneously to lift and scan their item(s). 

So all that went through my head, but what came out of my mouth was ""Sure, no problem!"" and I started walking towards them (they were ~6 feet away from me). I take not more than 2 steps before the daughter says ""Oh it's alright mom, I've got this"" and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself. The mom notices that I didn't match Usain Bolt's world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me, ""What awful service you have, forcing a pregnant woman to lift &lt;item name&gt; by herself.""

I just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if they'd like more hands on service that going to one of the non-self-checkout registers would probably be better. The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on me:

""I guess some people's mothers just didn't raise them right.""

What!?! I don't know what she expected me to do, maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item? I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me, so I ignored her. It's been years since that's occurred and it's still the experience from retail that I remember best.

They would steal VISA gift cards, use manager numbers to override the difference on the register so it balanced, and they also stole booze, pizza, and many other things.  This supposedly went on for a couple months, and the three of them had their own little operation.  They ended up stealing $48,000 worth of gift cards.  They are all being charged with felony theft and one of them is facing ten years as he has a long rap sheet and is being charged as an adult.

groundciv,28,,49,1r4jqn,,233,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

If you've read my previous posts on here, I try to show how much fun I have with the people I worked with as we have plenty of horror stories on this sub-reddit. I've worked with a fantastic group of people,  Black Friday was no different. 

I woke up at 2am, getting ready to start my twelve hour split shift. I was to work from 3am to 11am then come back and work 6pm to closing. A pretty long day to say the least. I grabbed a couple of five hour energies, and jumped into my gaming department. Today was some of the holiday paid workers' first day, so they were mainly there to direct people around the store. This is the story of one of those fellas. We'll call him G. 

I began talking with my group, showing them what we wanted to sell, reminding them of the deals to promote etc. While I did this, the group of people came in. 

The way we did it, was we had a route for all customers to follow no matter what. People were to follow this route until they got to the department of their choosing. They were to grab what they wanted, then move back into the line as the route ended at the registers. It was a very organized system to say the least. While the people were being herded through the lines, I began to hear screaming. 

This wasn't a AHHHH I'M IN TROUBLE kind of screaming this was a YEAHH WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!!! kind of screaming. My customers as if they were queued by a director all looked towards the isle, as did I. It was G. He was standing there holding the festive balloons cheering on our customers. 

**G:** OH you got THAT AWESOME LOW PRICED WII?? CONGRATS MAN WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!

You have to realize, this is a high ceiling open area store, and everybody in the store can hear him. 

**G:** BBBBLLLLACCCCKKKK OOOOPPSSS!!!! WOOOO HOOO!!! YOU GOT IT BRO! All I gotta say man is ZOMBIES!!! KILL THE ZOMBIES MAN!!!! 

I began to realize he was cheering our customers on, and just having a good old time. As he did this, other holiday people who also just started on Black Friday began to shout and cheer the customers on. I guess they thought this guy who started it all was somebody who had worked there for a while, and they thought it was normal. 

Basically, I thought it to be fantastic. I had one of the radios on me, and knowing that none of the new guys had radios, I began to talk about it. 

**Me:** You guys hear that? 

**Manager:** You mean the likely sound of epic tickling?

**Me:** Your neighbors must complain a lot if your wife sounds like a male screaming when you tickle her. 

**Manager:** Yeah you'd be surprised. Tell the new guys to put a cork in it. 

**Me:** Well, the customers kind of like it. 

**Manager:** They like being tickled eh? 

**Me:** ...

**Me:** Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.

**Manager:** Well who am I to stop them then?

**Me:** Yeah seriously, you're not God. 

It got to the point where most of the new people (and some of the regular employees) began to do this, all because of G. 

I don't work there anymore, but recently I visited the store to see some old friends. G is still there, and he's a supervisor now. I think the man deserves it, as long as he doesn't tickle our customers.

arsci991,56,,35,1ren2b,,217,"All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories, one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe. It's kind of a long one, but hopefully you all enjoy it!

A little background: I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items, including gun safes. This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year. We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see, with the largest (at the time) being an Canon Armory 80-gun safe. This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock. Our store only ever had 2 of them, they never had an official SKU#(we had to ring them under the generic ""merchandise"" SKU), we had them for over a year, and after we sold out we never saw them again. Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer, but they all ship with the same combination: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes, or by just guessing. It was no secret, and we encourage people to take a good look.

It was the evening, and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day. Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down. I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by, and he looked PISSED. And not just ""end of black friday"" pissed but ""someone done fucked up"" pissed, so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe. Literally ear to the door, asking if it was doing alright. Maybe not to the safe, but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe. Uh Oh. Things start running through my head...why didn't he just unlock it? HOW did a person get locked in it? Then he pulls me aside.

Assistant Manager: ""We have a situation.""

Me: ""A situation?""

AM: ""Yes, a kid just locked his brother in the 80-gun.""

Me: ""Soo why don't we unlock it?""

AM: ""It won't unlock. I think the battery died, but I replaced it and it's still not working.""

Me: ""How did he end up locked in it?""

AM: ""His brother apparently. He's over hiding in the feed racks last I saw. Not sure where the parents are, they haven't made an appearance yet.""

I went over and tried it myself, and sure as crap...it's locked. And this kid is FREAKING out, for obvious reasons. We tried a couple other batteries with no luck, and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other 80-gun, with no luck. The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs. 

We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little, and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup. Assistant Manager called the police, while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safe.

After about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out, we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a 5 minute lockout on the keypad...if the battery dies or is removed, you can't touch it for 5 minutes after putting the battery back in. So after 5 long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions, the safe OPENED. And this 15 year old kid, I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe, straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears. 

The police and fire department left pretty quick after that, but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us. Complaining about precautions, safety, how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently. Eventually we stopped her,

AM: ""Ma'am, your kid walked up to the safe, entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe. Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did, the battery died. At this point the brother closed and locked the door. And it's our fault for not taking enough precautions?""

Eventually the woman and her kids left. No policies changed, except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do. Gives us all a good chuckle. Every couple months she calls, and identifies her self as ""the person whose kid got locked in the safe."" Usually she's prying to know if we've changed our policies (we haven't) then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of (which she doesn't get). Oddly enough, its been another year and we've had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes!

SenorPierre,25,,46,1r0aps,,197,"what's up, Tales From Retail. I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,46,1rh8hc,,201,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

prickelypear,23,,27,1rf2t9,,187,"I've lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can remember.

I used to work in a big name retail store in a college town, we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously, and they were generally pretty laid back customers. But of course we got older customers as well.

One night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line. It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come. One of items was a basket, it looked like wicker but I don't remember what it was exactly. Either way when I rang it up it came up full price, ~$30-$40, and the woman stopped me.

**Woman:** That's supposed to be on sale, why is it ringing up full price?

**Me:** I'm not sure, I'll get one of the girls from that department to come up and she'll know what's going on.

While I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle (which this store doesn't have, we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much) and how this is so aggravating. Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the ""Clearance aisle"" and it's ringing up full price and she knows it wasn't placed there by another customer because there were many of them there. The girl from hard lines informs the woman we don't have a Clearance Aisle, but she knows where the baskets are and she will go look.

While we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up. Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others. The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale, the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one, it's full price and walks off. 

**Woman:** (to me) Well he needs the basket for his clothes.

**Me:** Okay (and I start to place it in the bagging area)

**Woman:** No! I'm not paying that price for it. I want it for the Clearance price! You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price. 

I don't remember what she was saying the ""Clearance price"" was, but it was far below the actual price. Usually if its less than $5-$6 we were told just give it to them, and even sometimes if it's $10 on something worth at least $35. But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be $15.

**Me:** Ma'am we don't have a Clearance aisle, the basket is full price and I don't have a way to lower it in my system.

**Woman:** That's bullshit, if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you *can* adjust the price!

**Me:** This store *doesn't have* a Clearance Aisle. We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isn't one of them.

**Woman:** No. That basket was on the Clearance Aisle. Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale. That one is too. I'm getting that basket but I am *not* buying ~$30-$40 for it. Where are the managers? This is bullshit I'm not dealing with you anymore.

So, with the woman's son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes, I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up. I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time; manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer, customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things, manager gives them what they want, and customer leaves smug. Not this manager, she always was my favorite. She gets to my till, listens to the, of course now calm and smiling woman, explain why she wanted the manager. 

**Woman:** So see? the basket was on the Clearance Aisle, but it rings up full price. If it's not on Clearance then it shouldn't have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there, and I need it, I expect to get it for the Clearance price.

**Manager:** (Smiling at her) We don't have a Clearance Aisle. That basket is in the home section with the other baskets. We have baskets on sale in that aisle, they have tags marking them. But this one isn't on sale. If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get one.

**Woman:** (smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes) NO! I will **NOT** go pick out another basket because of your mistakes!!! *I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance price!*

**Manager:** (still calm and smiling) Well, seeing as we still don't have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price. We aren't lowering it. If you want the basket it's ~$30-$40. Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase, you can pay for your other items and leave.

**Woman:** (screaming at this point) I'm never coming back here again, but I'm not done with this yet! This is ridiculous! I'm writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers! I will make sure you both lose your jobs! You can keep this shit, I'm not buying **ANY** of it!!

And with that she stormed off and out the door, leaving her son to mutter ""I'm so sorry..."" and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day. Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman. Nothing was going to happen. And nothing did. So much for not being done with it yet, we didn't hear a thing about about her after that. Her son did frequent the store though.

I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering.

Technically I'm not supposed to allow that, but she was actually buying a worse deal than she could otherwise get.

She hands me another coupon offering $15 off a purchase of $45 or more. Two red flags. First, we can't stack two kinds of coupons together. We can stack the same coupon in some circumstances, but different types we usually can't. Second, the coupon she gave me expired over a month ago.

Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

TennisAndBeer,4,,37,1r63y6,,168,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues. 

When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous, technically she's in another department, but she's been there like 20 years so I'm sure she could have me fired.

meguriau,19,,26,1r5sy8,,170,"Hi TFR, I‚Äôm back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It‚Äôs been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn‚Äôt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That‚Äôs preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs the most I can do for you at this point in time. We‚Äôll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN‚ÄôT DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I‚Äôm terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you‚Äôd left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN‚ÄôT CALL. 

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry to hear of your husband‚Äôs ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let‚Äôs just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don‚Äôt need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that‚Äôs retail!

xVarekai,86,,35,1r3e2x,,162,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

I guess nothing should surprise me anymore.","But they're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?",183,talesFromRetail

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.


I felt like a champion.


I left the door propped open so the bathroom would air out.

spotty82,18,,28,1r43bb,,147,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

Foliagus,31,,31,1r761t,,145,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.


Thanks for listening, TFR, you guys keep me sane.

**TL;DR:  I single-handidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air, before selling $9000 dollars of merchandise at 200% margin.**  ","Price-Matching, a mean lady, and a loss prevention incident. All in one night. T_T",176,talesFromRetail
MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,,19,1rep4z,,145,"A little backstory: I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school. I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes, however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy people...to be quite honest, I really enjoyed my time at this store...All my managers were great, it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool. I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked with...I guess it was kind of a utopian retail job.  

Now, a little more background about my particular job responsibilities...I was the stock room manager, I was the person that met the truck at the back door at 5am every tuesday, thursday, and saturday.  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipment....I knew how many boxes were coming, I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment.  In a nutshell, I knew the stock room backwards and forwards, knew what we had back there and what we didn't have because I unpacked it, organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers. There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor, and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they needed.

This particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times.  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me.  A little about our return policy...With a receipt and tags on the clothes, there was no time frame for returns.  You can buy something, put it in a closet for ten years, decide you don't want it and bring it back.  No problem.  If you don't have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes, you can always return them....things stay in the system basically indefinitely...but if you don't have the receipt, we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get.  If it says 50 bucks on the tag but comes up .25 cents, you get .25 cents back.  who knows what reduction stickers you've peeled off the tag.  So all this being said, here is my actual story...and I only remember this because in almost a year, this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this job.

Nice lady (NL) comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counter.

NL: Hi, MrDoctorSmartyPants!  How are you?  I haven't seen you the last few times I've been in here!

Me:  It has been a while, I'm doing pretty good...do you want to return these pants?  Do you have your receipt?

NL: I sure don't, but I've never taken the tags off of these as you can see, so I can still return them right?

Me: Yep you sure can, but, unfortunately if you don't have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as, and I'm sure you bought these a while back because I've never seen these in this store. (It should be noted the tag said $65 bucks for these particular pants)

NL:  Ok, that is fine, I've dealt with that before...but the tag says $65 dollars, and just because I don't have my receipt doesn't mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchase.

Me: I know you come here all the time, but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants, we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never there...and to be honest with you, in the time that I've worked here (since the store opened) I have never seen these pants, did you purchase them at another location?

NL:  Yes, but that doesn't matter because I paid $65 for them like a year and a half ago, and I've never worn them...but lets just return them and see what I can get back for them.

Me: ok, lets see...(at this point I scan the item and it comes up, no shit, at $2.45) Ok, it says $2.45.

NL: WHAT? That's robbery! That CAN'T be right.

Me: I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you, I explained our policy and you said you understood.  I've returned things without a receipt for you before....if I could give you more, I would...but I can't and I don't have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads.  

NL: Well this is absolutely unacceptable.  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost me....I know the policy but this is a little different...i paid a lot for these pants...this should be an exception!  I want to see a manager!

Me: Ma'am, I am the stock manager, I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants before...I'm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you, but I can't.  Honestly, this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy exists.

NL: Can't you just go look to make sure?  

Me: Sure, I'll do that for you.  (at this point i go in the back and out the back door for 10 minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back)  Nope.  We don't have any.  what the computer shows is the best I can do.

NL: NO! I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER! LESLIE! WHERE IS SHE?

Me: She isn't here today, ma'am...I'm the only manager in the store.

NL:  Well call her!

Me: I don't have her home number and I'm not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue.  I'm not making you return the pants, I'm not forcing you to take this money....you can keep the pants.

NL:  This is so stupid...I can't believe you're treating me like this! I come in here all the time! You should make exceptions!  Just give me my money and I'll be on my way...I don't want these stupid pants.

Me: Ok, Ma'am...here you go $2.45.  I'm really sorry for your inconvenience, have a nice day.

NL:  Yeah, you ruined this nice day! Wait until I talk to your manager!

I actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about something....the lady walked up and said hello, was cordial, and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior.  Sorry if this is so long, it wasn't even that bad...it just stuck out in my mind.

TL;DR: Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance, thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine.","Woman understands store return policy, refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance.",164,talesFromRetail
prettehkitteh,24,,30,1rcsdq,,140,"Wall of Text coming! 'tis the season, and I'm feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they don't need. I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier, so I never really experienced Black Friday - except one year, when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side. I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning. For some reason, the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at 5am. I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout, and we had special areas where the really popular/discounted toys were set up the day before, so I pretty much had no idea where anything was.

We didn't get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon, but people were lined up, and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early. I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside. I was immediately flooded with shouted questions:

""WHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOS?!""
""WHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SON!!""
""I NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTION?!""

I did my best to stutter answers out as people didn't even stop moving for me to answer. I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos (TMEs from now on) were because everyone wanted one. I could not believe how many people wanted one. I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive, and after the initial rush for the first two hours, people started being a little more polite, though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on. That was when crazy beard came in.

CB was a grungy ex-confederate-looking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face. He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded, ""I need a TME."" 

Me: ""Of course sir, if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right, they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle, you can't miss them.""

CB: ""Are you sure there are any left?""

Me: ""I haven't been back there in a little while, so unfortunately I don't know, I'm sorry.""

He waved a hand at me and scurried off. I thought that was the end of it. A minute later, he scurried back, visibly a lot more agitated.

CB: ""There were no TMEs!""

Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we did have some this mor--""

CB: ""How could you not have any TMEs?! You must have more in the back, I need one!""

I knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before - there was no backstock. I tried to explain this to CB as he started shaking.

CB: ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEs!""

Me: (fishing for anything to get this guy off my back) ""I-I'm sorry sir, there's not much I can do. If you had gotten here earlier--"" (big mistake)

CB: ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN I GET HERE, YOU'RE A FUCKING TOY STORE, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES?! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER!""

Those magic words. I was shaking now (I don't handle anger very well) and was relieved to get some help. I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom. CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his world-ending problem, but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder. We waited. I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers, so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CB.

Five minutes passed. I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom, trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers. CB wasn't amused, so I just kept standing there, shuffling my feet. I couldn't leave the guy, so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing. Another five minutes passed.

CB: ""What the fuck is taking him so long?""

Me: ""I don't know, I'm so sorry, I can go look for a manager if you want.""

CB: ""You're staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up, I know a cop out when I hear one.""

Me: ""I'm not trying to abandon you sir, I want to help--""

CB: ""You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HEAR ME?""

I was on the verge of crying at this point. I picked up the phone for a third time, trembling, trying to take a breath so I didn't start crying over the intercom - when the lead manager Tim finally showed up, out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly. CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim, who was 6'3"", built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long, braided black beard. Tim, who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees, asked ME what the problem was, which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitless.

Me: ""We're out of TMEs, and he really would like one.""

CB: ""That's RIGHT. I have a problem with the fact that--""

Tim: ""Just a moment, sir. Prettehkitteh, thank you, you can go back to the front.""

I scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didn't have TMEs, we didn't have TMEs. I watched as CB's anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little, to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tim's best gentle giant voice. Within two minutes, Tim smiled and pointed out the door. CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out. 

Tim came over to me, gave me a big hug, and told me to go take a breather in the back room. The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively, and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand.

Techsupportvictim,9,,46,1ragwd,,137,"Another tale (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1raduq/yesterday_i_was_fussed_at_for_not_accepting_an/) reminded me of this jem

When I was working big box ish books and more, I would get folks demanding we 'override' coupons all the time. And I was the manager. Old coupons, coupons they were clearly trying to double up etc. Thing was we had no override. It was all off bar codes and your reward card. Once something was 'past its sell by' forget it.

I had one day where we had this 'bounce back' redeeming. It was right after holidays and it was a 50% off the REGULAR price of one hardcover book. Art books excluded (being near a high end area we had some crazy expensive titles we basically sold at cost). 

All day folks are trying to stack it on NYT titles, use it on movies so on and so on. I'm down to my last hour and I'm just tired of it. I've already kicked out four folks for calling lawsuit (price company policy we stop all transactions at that point), with four 'I'm going to get you fired' rants. We have to document in detail all customer issues so I had paperwork on all four of them and the other yelling customers. Thankfully for every yelling customer there were several that just shrugged it off as their failure to read.

So I'm in the back, not actually the floor manager that hour, helping the stock room guys pull up their sold today lists to see what needs to go on the restock carts. A call comes back that our FM is with a customer and there's a guy yelling he wants the manager. Sure I'll come out. 

Guy wants to use the coupon on an art book. He's been told no, they are excluded. He's yelling that the cashier can and will take it etc. I cut in and introduce myself as the manager. He goes through his rant again. I explain that it's all programmed into our software and no we can't. He gives that manual override line. With some swear words tossed in. And some 'if that stupid cashier' comments

I'm done. I really want to hulk out on the guy. But I don't. I'm not sure how I kept my cool but I did. The rest of the convo goes something like: 

Me: so vacation or do you have a home here too

Him: excuse me?

Me: I said are you on vacation or do you keep a home here as well as (city our home office is in)

Him: I live here, why the bleeping bleep would I live there

Me: because the only way you can say what our system can and can't do is if you helped right it and those staff all work at the home office. 

Me (rubbing it in) and as a member of the home office you are fully aware that all employee purchases must be rung up by a manager and employees are not allowed to avail themselves of a reward card or the coupons issued in that program. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to report these violations and your harassment of my staff to HR. 

Me: (still rolling with it) if you would like to purchase this book I will ring you up for the employee discount of 10% for art department titles. What was your employee number? 

At which point he walked out without saying a word. And no I didn't think he was an employee I just said it to shut him up and make him hopefully see what a fool he was acting by telling us how our stuff runs. 

Never saw him again, never heard anything about him calling and complaining. Although our camera system has audio and our home office can and does remotely capture all footage to keep us honest. My district manager apparently saw that particular moment and was quite amused.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

‚ÄúHey, are you unmined?‚Äù

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She‚Äôs my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and ‚Äúyeah‚Äù is all I can manage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I‚Äôve known since elementary school.
‚ÄúYou working all day today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBummer. We‚Äôre having a pool party. You could have come.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I‚Äôm here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I‚Äôm totally scared of talking to girls.

‚ÄúI wish I could. I hope you‚Äôre having a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe we can do something next week.‚Äù Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

‚ÄúTotally. You have a pen?‚Äù

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I‚Äôm both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy‚Äôs Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

‚ÄúCall me. We‚Äôll set something up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, thanks!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you later!‚Äù She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it‚Äôs all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I‚Äôm feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I‚Äôm so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom‚Äôs stash (don‚Äôt do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she‚Äôs just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bummed. This went by took quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has,‚Äù I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR ‚Ä¶ next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I‚Äôd give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it‚Äôs indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I‚Äôll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","‚ÄùBag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2‚Äù or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",198,talesFromRetail
littlewoolie,8,,29,1r6hc9,,131,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,160,talesFromRetail
aturquoiseseashell,12,,24,1rg9do,,128,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch‚Ä¶""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am‚Ä¶"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise. Definitely one of my more memorable encounters.",You all are acting VERY suspicious!,152,talesFromRetail

You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever. This pair of kids walk in, one looks 15, the other maybe 11, and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone. Well, manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM. I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security. Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream!!  He stops her, calls her mom, who comes in SCREAMING at her (in perfect english) and makes her spit out those earrings. We only got 3 out of 4 back. She can keep the last one.

AAEmmerson,23,,21,1ra3qv,,113,"You all seemed to really like my [Bacon sandwich](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r7jes/thrown_out_of_the_airport_all_for_a_bacon_sandwich/) post so much. I thought I'd tell another story from the airport coffee shop.

This one is more asshole manager than customer.

In our little unit there was very few places to actually store things, so most of our stuff was stored in the bowels of the airport. To get it up into the behind security bit of the airport was a real pain.

We had store guys who'd pack a cage of goods, like the big tall ones you'd see in a supermarket, but then we had to take them into a separate room, with airport security, and unpack all the boxes onto a big scanner, and then repack the cage. Often single handedly running back and forth to either end.

It's a royal pain in the butt, and even worse that 99% of the security guards shrugged and said not my job if something was about to fall off or break. I don't blame them, was just a pain. 

Well one day to do this job, when I start unpacking the cage I notice that there's a puddle of milk underneath. (For the record our milk came in boxes, with a huge plastic bladder inside), so obviously it was leaking, which in itself was not hugely unusual, you'd just grab the mop in there and clean it up. 

So I put them on the belt and send them through, when finally they get to the other side I lift them off, as  i do so, the bottom of the boxes opens, and about 40litres of milk gushes out, all over me, and the floor. I get absolutely soaked. 

I have to keep packing the trolley though, because some of the stuff is frozen and you have to do it in quick time. Except the second box of milk does pretty much the same again, as soon as it touches the cage, it explodes over the floor. 

At this point, i'd been working since 4am, it was 1 pm, i'd had no breakfast, a non stop morning, and was tired and emotional and somewhat covered in 80 litres of milk,

Under threat of death from security, I was told I had to clear it all up, because yeah milk smells. So I traipsed the cage upstairs and to my manager (a different supervisor to Bacon sandwich man) who's just finishing off his break (after an hour working).

I ask him for an extra pair of hands to get the whole thing cleared up because quite frankly it was going to take me for ever. He stands up, and laughs in my face, and walks off shouting ""get a mop bucket and do it yourself"" - It really did take all my powers of self control not to rugby tackle him and punch his head in, but I'm honestly close to rage tears with being so tired drenched. 

I gather my thoughts and go do the job, as unpleasant and as long as it took me, when I get back, and ask for my meal voucher for my break, he tells me I used it all up cleaning up the milk, It's only when I stand up face to face with him (i'm at least 6'3 to his 5'7) and remind him of my legal rights to a break that he backs down.

Needless to say I refused to ever work with him again, and he quickly got transferred to another shop in the airport. That was the worst day of my retail life I think. ",Why I nearly cried over spilled milk,134,talesFromRetail
rumplesplitskin,25,,15,1re4w8,,114,"We had a power cut at the station the other night, thankfully the only customers in the shop were just in buying a few grocery items. Nobody was on the forecourt getting fuel at the time. The only power we had was the emergency battery back up that powers the lights, nothing else no tills, pumps or computer. Even the main door had to be physically pulled open to let people out, it was obvious to anyone with a IQ over that of a cabbage that we were not open for business.

Those customers that were in at the time understood that because of the outage we could not process and credit/debit cards and worse still we could not open the tills to give change. It was a pain in the arse but we managed to give change by breaking in to the staff tea kitty so we got by without having to refuse any sales.

Then the last in the line a 18ish old guy decided that he needed petrol. This following is how that conversation went..

ME : Ok, your total comes to ¬£2.56. Due to the power cut we can't open the tills so if you have close to the correct amount in cash that would be a help.

PP(petrol pr*ck) I only have some pound coins is that ok ?

ME : Yeah, that's fine. We'll just call the total ¬£2.50 and i hand him a 50p coin back.

PP : Thanks, i'll hand in the 6p next time ok ?

ME : Naw, that's ok. Don't worry about it.

PP : Thanks, bye.

Just as my cashier is pulling the door open for him he stops and turns back to me.

PP : Oh i think i better get some petrol for the morning.

ME : Sorry, but we have no way to sell you fuel. Everything including the tills is out so i can't take payments.

In hindsight i should have worded this differently but it was late and i was just wanted him out of the shop so we could close early and get on with documenting tonight's outage for the next shift in the morning.

PP : Then i'll just leave you the cash and you can ring it up when the power comes back on.

ME : Sorry but i can't do that.

PP : (cuts me off) But i NEED petrol, you'll just have to figure something out.

He then storms out to the pumps where he's parked and lifts the nozzle expecting the petrol to flow. I'm looking at my cashier asking him did that really just happen ? After a good ten seconds or so with the guy waiting out there he waves his arms to get my attention and shouts at me to ""turn the fucking pump on!""

I grab the padlocks that we use to lock the pumps overnight with and head out to let this idiot know that he's not getting petrol from us tonight. As i'm walking over to him he's still standing there with the nozzle in his car looking at me like i'm the idiot.

ME : We have a power cut. We have no power to turn the pumps on.

PP : Don't lie to me, your lights are on. you have power, you just want to get home don't you ?

ME : Yes i do want to get home but i still can't give you any petrol without electricity to power the pumps. Those are emergency battery lights.

PP : I NEED petrol, what are you going to do ? i'm not leaving until i get my petrol.

ME : (really pissed off now) Well what i'm going to do i lock these pumps, close the shutters and then go home.

PP : WHAT ? You can't talk to me like that i'm a customer.

ME : No, you're a f**king idiot. now leave before i call the police to have you removed.

Normally i would never talk this way to any of our customers but this guy's attitude and pure dumbness just hit a nerve with me.

PP : Fuck you, you fat munt.

ME : Yeah ok, just leave.

PP : I want to talk to your manager, you're getting fired!

ME : I am the manager and i'm telling you to leave the premises before i call the police.

He drops the nozzle on the ground and looks at me as if to say pick that up bitch!

ME : Really ? What are you a child in a man's body ? Grow up.

PP : F**k you.

He gets into his car and drives off but not before leaving a parting shot of calling me a fat cow. Ok, i was a little taken back by this as i'm a 6.2"" hairy arsed dude with three day old stubble but still a cow ? that really hurt :)

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it, he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldn't figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me.  I ignored him and finished the drink.  As I handed it back, he looked at it, told me anybody could make a martini, and slapped 36 cent on the counter.  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached, turned back around and said ""I think I tipped you to fn much.  I can make my own gd martini next time.  Enjoy your minimum wage.""  Okay.  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing I'd said the entire time was ""What would you like to drink?""  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness, but I brushed it off; just another night at the bar right?

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking."" 



Label that with a big NOPE.JPG and send it off to the printers!

tl;dr: Guy wanted me to hire him as assistant. His quality wasn't quite up to par what I was looking for so I said no. He continues to harass me in a negger-way of trying to force-guilt me into hiring him. Didn't work.",Negging Happens In Businesses Too?,130,talesFromRetail

Speaking of churches, I can't stand the church goers who preach to me EVERY WEEK how, ""Oh, why are you working TODAY? It's SUNDAY! The day of rest! You shouldn't have to work today!"" I just hate that. I want to scream, ""because people like you come in to buy crap!""

Mystic-Spiral,23,,29,1rb12d,,96,"This is a story of a horrible client, a weak manager, and a poor associate (me) caught amidst it all. 

It was a dark night in late spring. The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms. I love my job and my customers at this store (this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location) are generally exceptionally awesome. Even the ‚Äúbad ones‚Äù aren‚Äôt really THAT bad and only minor annoyances. Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD (manager on duty) and I were cleaning up around the store. Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being.   

For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine; I know, somehow, that this is going to be bad. 

DB: ‚ÄúI bought this dress the other day (whips out cotton dress) and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back. Can I exchange it?‚Äù

Me: (Hoping this is easier than I first thought) ‚ÄúOf course, let‚Äôs see if we still have another in the same size!‚Äù(Extra small petite)

We did not. 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry; it doesn‚Äôt look like we have another in the same color and size. We can exchange it for a different color, or I can refund you back your money for it, no problem!‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo, I want to wear THIS one!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI can look it up and see if another store has it if you want. We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there. We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer, but if there is a low inventory, there‚Äôs no guarantee you will get t unfortunately. The inventory is about 24 hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shown.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo. That is unacceptable. I want this one! Can‚Äôt you just sew a new button on it?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt have spare buttons, but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesn‚Äôt look off balance if you like.‚Äù (Mind you the button is TINY. About half the size of a dime. It‚Äôs really not that big of an issue.)

Now, this where things start to go downhill. 

DB: ‚ÄúWhat will you do with the dress if I return it?‚Äù  
Honesty, to me,  is the best policy, but had I known how this was going to go down, I probably would have just lied to this person.

Me: ‚ÄúMost likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped out.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúThen rip a button off another dress and sew it to this one!‚Äù

I am VERY taken aback by this.  She wants me‚Ä¶.to destroy‚Ä¶. No way! Just. No. 

Me: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, I cannot destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúWHAT?! You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it, what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent out?!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWell, that dress is now YOURS since you bought it. You can do with it what you will, and if you return it, then it becomes the property of the company again,  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor. The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúI RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS! YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANT!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI am not going to destroy company property. You can return the dress or I can find one at another store. Those are your options. I am not risking my job by destroying company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúTHAT IS BULL SHIT! YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! I RAN A BUSINESS! I KNOW! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAlright, MOD (who has been listening the whole time) this client would like to speak with you.‚Äù

The MOD comes over and I walk away, continue to tidy up the store and do my job. Then I see the MOD take the client‚Äôs dress‚Ä¶. And the dress on the floor‚Ä¶. I'm thinking that she CAN'T POSSIBLY be doing what I think...Yes, the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DB‚Äôs dress. 

Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on. During the entire time DB won‚Äôt stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy, etc etc etc.  She then turns to me again and tells me ‚ÄúLosing your job over making a customer happy? That is SUCH bullshit! I don‚Äôt know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPY.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond, it will be nasty. 
DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes over.

MOD: ‚ÄúMystic-Spiral, I‚Äôm sorry that I went over your head and did that. I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didn‚Äôt want a scene.‚Äù 

I REALLY loved that MOD, she was like another mom to me, but I absolutely could not respond to her. I don‚Äôt think I said a word for the rest of the evening. The whole thing boils my blood even now. 

So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave, you can get someone to destroy company property just so you don‚Äôt have to fork over a few cents for a replacement button at a fabric store.

Sapphires13,19,,19,1r8o2i,,96,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""   
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""   
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""   
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""   
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""   
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""   

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""   
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""   
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""    
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""    
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""   
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]    
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""    
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""   
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""    
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",115,talesFromRetail

Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

**TL;DR - Caught a guy from my HS stealing; asked me if we got him good, showed him his theft video. Year later same dude busted robbing a bank.**

KroipyBill,11,,41,1rhynu,,124,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

thompsontoons_art,16,,15,1r9l9k,,98,"Customer walks up to me just as I'm about to go on my late afternoon lunch break. She says she's there to pick up an order for [X person name: We'll call her Fuddle Duddle], and it should be a couple of bedskirts. She received a call that the order was in. Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse. I go to our holds area to find the order...

...there's no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me. I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer. 

""Ma'am, you said your name is Fuddle Duddle? I don't see any orders out back with that name attached.""

""Well, no. My name is Sue. Fuddle is my friend; I'm in the area, so she asked me to pick up her order for her.""

The next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up. Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few large-ish purchases. Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure she'd paid for the order being shipped to the store, and it just needed to be picked up. I look through our log book listing paid for pick-up orders, and there was no listing of Fuddle's name in the book. I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for; if this was the case, our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after 48hrs. Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts. I tried looking up Ms. Duddle's customer information in our register and through our catalog system, and I found no purchase records at all. 

""Well, that can't be right,"" Sue said, ""We were here in the store. We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff. We were here for hours. You must have a record."" I informed her that their purchases would be in our records, but they wouldn't be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them. Since their names didn't come up in our profile search, I figured they'd opted out of having a profile created. 

Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information. Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle. I inquire what style bedskirt it was that she'd ordered for pick up, and she said she couldn't really describe it. (She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store, but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasn't available in store at the time.) Supposedly it was a plain tailored style, and she had a receipt for the item at home... but she wasn't at home that very moment, so she couldn't give me the information on the receipt. She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt, but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order... which she said is, ""...a queen sized dust ruffle in white... or maybe it was two twins."" She couldn't even remember what she ordered. I described a couple of the styles to her, and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely. I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone else's name, and she said no... but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up. So... we had a third person involved in this order. I took down Fuddle's phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce, who was originally called and notified about the order, and I told her we'd give her a call once we sort the issue out.

Sue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddle's order (Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine, which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go). Sue looks at me saying, ""So, if you eventually find this bedskirt, you'll have to mail it to us for free, right? I don't want to drive another 60 miles to come pick it up, and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow it's not."" I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them. Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leave.

Meanwhile, my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddle's original purchase... which has a queen sized bedskirt on it. ""She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store, and they left with her."" What could she have possibly ordered? We went back to the holds area. There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased... under Fuddle's neighbor Pierce's name and contact phone number... and it was unpaid for. I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadn't pulled out of the parking lot yet. They were gone. My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store. We're just hoping things will work out so we don't have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information. The neighbor does get a hold of Sue, she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friend.

**TL:** Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend. Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we can't track down the order that's supposed to be in store. The actual order wasn't a bedskirt, it wasn't paid for, and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer.

GrimGuy,29,,19,1r0zg2,,93,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

Fixer_,14,,19,1r8gem,,92,"**Background:**I work at a popular electronics/appliance store as a Computer &amp; Tablets Sales Consultant. I love my job. However, we get our fair share of nasty customers! 

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

At this point i offer to go get my supervisor, and the man accepts. I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown. At this point I don't interact with the customer again. Apparently, my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said. He (Being the awesome supervisor he is) refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price, saying ""Sir, it's mid November, we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on display.

According to my Sup, the man said nothing but ""I'll be back."" and walked out of the store. 

I'm not sure when he will be back, but I hope he isn't as big of an asshole next time!","""I'll be back!""",111,talesFromRetail
kemmer,37,,23,1rbkuk,,92,"Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino. I've worked at several other retail jobs since then, and the casino job is easily the worst I've ever had. The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money, and they took out that anger and frustration on us. Some stories...

**Orientation:**

Everyone that was starting work in the casino that week, no matter the job or department, took part in the same orientation. It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms, but it ended in a tour of the whole property. We saw the high roller suites, the ballrooms, all the restaurants, etc. While touring the steakhouse (the most expensive restaurant), the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available. He pulled out a bottle of one (I don't remember what it was now, probably Cristal or something like that), and told us how lucky we were to see it up close, because *none of us would ever be able to afford it*. It's been 7 years since I had that job, and the memory of that STILL pisses me off. I was 17 years old, that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make. Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers, there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting. It's been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu. Just for my own satisfication, you know? I should have known then this job was gonna suck.

**Counting:**

I'm not gonna front, I'm pretty bad at math. I'm fairly intellegent otherwise, graduated college with a 3.85 GPA, but I've just never been able to wrap my head around numbers. One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink. The order was something like $12.08. He handed me $13, I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him 92 cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter. I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now. It honesly couldn't have been more than 3 seconds that I hesitated, but in that time he started screaming, literally screaming, at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been. But he couldn't stop there, oh no, he had to *call his wife over* so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were. ""Can you believe it?! How can they hire people this dumb?!"" I had figured out his change in the meantime, handed it to him, turned around and sobbed over the chili. The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgust.

**Suicide:**

My most memorable day working at the casino, and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever. This place was essentially like Disneyland, in that there was a whole underground world for the employees. We had our own stores, our own bank, our own cafeteria, etc. To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli, we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing. The parking garage was right outside the deli doors. One day I was walking back to work after my break, when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage. I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground, mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids. I couldn't tell what was going on, but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli. Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage. They had already removed the body, but I got to see the remnants. The image of that will forever stick in my brain.

Those are my ""best"" stories, but that doesn't even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car, the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company, or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families (neither knew of the other). I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time. Those cookies were damn good.

TL;DR: Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth.

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

I tell her

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

I know it's not in back, it's not got a home and it's not even being carried at our stores. I look anyways and it's not there. I go back to her and explain that it's not in back and not carried at this store. I know what's coming up next, she sighs and tells me ""is there a manager around I can talk too?""

I tell her the Team Leader has gone home, and I'll have to call for a Manager to come and that would take a while since they are in a meeting. She tells me ""well, I just want an explanation from a manager. I guess I won't get this movie, but, I won't leave until I have a better explanation then 'we don't have it'. I know you do have it because the ad I read it and they wouldn't lie"".

I reluctantly call a manager. About 30 mins afterwards Ted the Store Manager comes around. I hate Ted and so does everyone else. Ted is arrogant and unreasonable and runs the store with an iron fist. He comes up to me, and says a flat ""What do you want?"" I explain the issue and then the lady asks why it's not in stock.

Ted looks at her, and then looks at the PC and then looks at me. 

""I'm sorry ma'am we do not carry this movie at all. Perhaps i could find you another movie. There is no other reason. We can not order X we do not even carry the movie.""

""Would another X carry it or was it just this store that's slow?""

""no. If it's not on our database that means we do not carry it""

Luca20,38,,24,1ragja,,87,"I work at a large retail store that sells mostly hardware and wood products.  I work in the lumber area with only male coworkers.  This means that most of my coworkers pretty much whip their junk out if a woman customer comes in. 
Last Saturday(we get lots of clueless DIYers on the weekend) a lady came in needing some molding cut to length.  This lady was so hot that I wanted to avoid looking like I'm showing her special treatment (most guys are guilty of this).. 
She was in her late 20's(I'm 21).  She was about 6'0"" had gorgeous blond hair, extremely dark brown eyes, and the ass was fat.  The only problem was she had these Gary Busey eyes.  She was clearly not normal.  She somehow seemed like the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" type.  The kind that will laugh manically at everything with eyes *really* wide open.  I did everything I could to just stay professional.
Eventually she finds the molding she wants and asks me to rip it........meaning to cut it lengthwise.  It's called ""quarter round"" you might have some in the room your sitting in right now http://www.paramount-floors.com/i/Quarter_Round_White_Oak_1.jpg this means to cut that piece into a 45 degree prism. ""You've got to be shitting me"" I thought.  ""Surely she's just trying to be funny, or fuck with me"".  She just stared back with her crazy Gary Busey eyes.  After 5 seconds of silence, I look up chuckling and say ""you know I really can't do that, right?""  She stands right up against me, chest now pressed on the back of my arm, ""gosh, this piece of molding, ripped, would be perfect for my project..""
""This bitch is crazy"" I thought"".  Cutting a piece of wood that tiny by hand will look ridiculous, no matter how hard I try. After quite some time of telling her that it will look like crap, she still insists.  So I get a Drimmel  http://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Cordless-8300-01-Dremel-Multi-Max-12V-Oscillating-Tool.jpg and get to it, very, very slowly. 
It takes me about 40 minutes to rip the (2) 10.5 foot pieces of molding, and it still looks like it was cut by a drunken sailor.  I give them to her with a smile and a ""no problem"".  She thanks me and talks with me for about 10 minutes.  This lady is talking like she's known me for years, and it's making me a little uncomfortable.  She's hot, but a serious nutcase.. She isn't *just* being friendly and I'm not sure what she's getting at.
When she leaves, I see her pick up my card, and wink.  
I get a picture message from an unknown number that night.  It reads ""heyyy Luca20, that quarter round worked out really well!""  With a picture of her, showing a*lot* more chest, splintery jagged molding in the background.

ExcerptMusic,18,,13,1rahbf,,87," I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues. Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it. However, there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults.

 Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phone.

Keep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes. I am being as nice as possible on the outside.

I had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone. I knew it wasn't going to be fun to figure out because he had on the ""fuck you"" face and looked to be in the ""ignorant with technology"" age range. He presented me with 3 problems

1. My alarm doesn't alert me in the morning and I need it for work.

2. The outside keys don't lock so the phone turns the speaker on.

3. The battery runs out when I unplug it at night.

He then followed by ""I bought this phone 30 days ago and want to return it"" and ""I've been with this company for 10 years""

 Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the ""I've been shopping here for X amount of years""... This company doesn't care about you personally.. they just don't. This isn't some mom &amp; pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business. This is a multi-BILLION dollar company. They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those 10 years, because I guarantee this isn't your first time complaining. 

 So you bought the phone 30 days ago? Sorry you can't return it. There is a 14 day return policy on phones company wide. This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors (which doesn't happen). We could also get the manufacturer to replace it (if there is actually a problem with it). There was no problem with the phone so there is 100% nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone. So I check it out and explain to him what is going on.

 The alarm.. First off, his alarm was off. He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesn't work. I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdays(I did this for him). He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off 5 minutes after it was supposed to. I tested the alarm feature about 15 times. No issues. If it happened every time like he said, I would have seen it at least once. Even after telling him that the alarm was off, he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically. No. It wasn't. Next issue.

 The outside keys wouldn't lock. Ok. This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys. He also has a horizontal belt carrier. He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him, he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didn't do that. I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling. You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call. After talking more with him, I figured out why his old phone didn't have that issue. He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone. Next issue.

 The battery runs out at night. This one is just stupid... He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night, he unplugs it and leaves it open. The phone also has the screen timeout disabled. So at night, he unplugs the phone at 100%, leaves it open fully lit, and goes to bed. Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead. He must sleep with the lights on or something, I don't know. I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in (even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years). A problem with battery capacity in 2 years isn't going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because ""the phone dies at night"".

 Now that i've fixed his issues, he says that he will try it out but he doesn't expect it to work because it was the phone. 

 Sorry guy, it wasn't the phone. It was user error through and through. Don't blame technology for your mishaps. Technology isn't some black magic. 90% of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read. If the alarm says ""OFF"" then the alarm is off. It's that simple. 

 As much as I hate these people, I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues. It's almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door. I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it. Seriously, those are the best customers ever..

TL;DR- User error accounts for most errors.

LossPreventionSucks,24,,21,1rfcsa,,85,"This is my first time posting here, but I'll just warn you this can get a bit winded.  I've yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy, as my manager mentioned I should ""keep quiet"" about the whole ordeal.


Now... I work for a popular gaming store chain.  I'm sure you can guess which one.  I've heard the horror stories, however I've had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention Manager.

To start the day off, I had to open.  I went in about 15 minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch.  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in.  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didn't go over hours and he was totally fine with that.  Anyway... 2 minutes after walking through the door, a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling ""I'M HERE! LET ME IN!""  I ignore them for the first 5 minutes (I mean, gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and it's almost 2 hours before open).  I walk up to them and inform them we open at 10.  The man quickly snaps ""Bullshit! We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release!"".  So I texted my manager and, sure enough, he said ""Absolutely not.  If they're picking a system up, let them in, though.""  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with ""No, I want to return this stuff"" holding up at least $400 worth of XBox games and a system.  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down.  He finally agreed and left only to call every 2 minutes or so and ask if we were open, yet... For the next hour and a half.  Now, because this guy was so persistent, I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didn't have to wait for the 20 minute timer to go up.  I figured he'd come back right away.  That was my first mistake.  He never did come back and, due to us being so busy and me being the only one there, I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bit.


On to the second half... I was there alone all morning.  I had several people asking for systems, which require me to go through a locked door, through a hallway, and into another locked door to get to.  I have to do this for each system whether or not 3-4 people in line are waiting for a system.  This gives 5-10 minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store.  So what did I do?  I propped the first door open.  Mistake number two.


After a bit, my part-timer came in.  45 minutes after opening (I repeat, we were open for 45 whole minutes, at this point... 30 of which I had spent alone with nearly 30 customers in the store picking up systems)... In walks our Loss Prevention guy.  I didn't know he was Loss Prevention, though... No... He instantly walks in, starts yelling at my part-timer about the door, and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there.  Still no introduction, the following commenced:

FatLossPreventionMan:  ""Why the hell is the back door open?""

Me:  ""Can I help you?""

FatLP:  ""IS YOUR SAFE OPEN?  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING"" (remember, there's multiple people in the store at this point, several in line)

Me: *oh fuck*  ... stutter... stutter...""Yeah, there was an incident this morning where I had a return, but he never showed up.  I also needed to add change to the register""

FatLP: ""You can't do this.  Are you the manager?""

Me: ""No, may I ask who you are?""

FatLP: *beaming* ""I'm Dave.  I'm here to audit and help with customers"".

Me:  ""Okay.  Yeah, I messed up.  It's been a hectic morning.""

After this exchange, he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store.  Mind you... I'm not the manager.  I'm not even assistant manager.  I'm a store worker who gets paid 50 cents more than minimum wage with manager duties.  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs 7 feet in the air, saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them (I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how).  He then answered phones with just ""Hi, this is Dave"".  No greeting, nothing... Just... Dave.  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didn't know the answer... These people then called back so they could complain to me.


At this point, he had yelled at my coworker and I, loomed over us, and degraded us so badly that I was near tears.  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how ""pathetic"" this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing.  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I.  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on, giving no personal space.  The customer asks ""Are you okay?"" and Dave butts in ""She's fine... Do you want the GPG?"".  I said nothing... I was beaten and I couldn't do anything.  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about 90 different things that I had done that was a terminable offense.  I was afraid if I said anything more, that I would be done... And I need this job.  


Anyway... There's a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share (mostly from corporate), but this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.


TL;DR:  Shitty customers banging on the door.  I screw up.

I'm a rather short (5'3""), and slim girl, so I definitely do not give off a ""strong"" vibe (I am much more so than most people think though, that type of job definitely can keep you in shape).

 Most of the time, it's older customers who seem almost worried for me, as in a ""are you sure that's not too heavy for you?"" when I'm clearing off a table. Yes, I can, otherwise I would not be carrying all of this, that would be silly. I appreciate the concern, but no need to make comments.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

One of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while I'm lifting it, and says ""You shouldn't do that! You're a girl! You're not nearly strong enough to do that!""

We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.

UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""

BuffHipster,5,,13,1r556k,,72,"Was suggested to cross post here from [this AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r2b9l/whats_the_most_insulting_thing_you_ever_said_to). My buddy destroyed an asshole customer with a solid one-sentence send off. Enjoy!

&gt;Not me, but my friend. He was at work, and apparently some asshole customer was berating a new employee, like new as in fresh out of training. This customer was a repeat offender to this type of stuff, people who work retail know the type. My buddy, having worked there for a year or two, comes up and tells the new employee, ""Go, I'll take care of this."" Before the customer can tear into him, he said in a quiet voice, ""Your business is not worth your bullshit and the world would be a better place without you.""

&gt;Customer left speechless.

So bonus post-story stuff, I guess... so far, my buddy hasn't gotten in trouble for it, which he totally could as he is not a manager. As for context, the customer was using profanity and being blatantly unreasonable. This poor new employee literally walked out of the training room to go the bathroom, and customer asked him a question, and then proceeded to ""How could you not know where this is? What fucking use are you? *BLAH BLAH BLAH SO MAD*.""

abbeyinreallife,13,,18,1r1eap,,70,"I work in your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store, and I've had the job for around 2 months. For a majority of the time, I've been the designated punching bag (aka ""guest services"") in the store. I run the phones, announcements, returns, special orders, cashiering, complaints, etc. in my little box. 

Today was a surprisingly slow day, but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out. We had a line of maybe 6 or 7 parties, and I was checking people out along with 2 other cashiers. Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns. Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

*She went and grabbed one of our reusable bags*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

ME: ""..kay. Your total is [total]."" *she pays me in cash*

I had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change, but I restrained myself!

HER: ""That cashier is so nasty."" *leaves*

After closing, I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people ""oh you don't mind do you?"" as she pushed past, yelled at the cashier for ""blinding her"" with the red scanner light, and tried to get her to give her a discount without a coupon.

Needless to say, we were not sad to see her go.

Maloth_Warblade,6,,19,1rhx0y,,91,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,14,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

HeloRising,16,,15,1ra3ti,,64,"Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it, I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one I'd forgotten.

This was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day. Alas, the day was not to remain so. A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves. She smiled and I greeted her, asked her if she was looking for anything in particular, she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that. 

About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried. 

(Note the punctuation in her statement is very. very. deliberate.)

""Umm...I'm trying to decide on one of these It's for my daughter she's graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldn't have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I don't know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe that's a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe they'd go well in her new place but I don't know for sure what it looks like because it's all the way out past the freeway and--""

This goes on for quite some time. I'm overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything she's saying because it's coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesn't seem to want to slow down. I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned. After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesn't intend to stop. Like ever. 

At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security. This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stay-at-home moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasn't unheard of and it was starting to look like she'd either taken too much or too little of something strong.

By now she'd begun almost a full-blown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast. Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly. Also she'd stopped focusing on me, she was no longer looking directly at me anymore. She had this kind of ""thousand yard stare"" going on. 

Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting. Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point, spewing molten crazy on everything around her.

Just before the ten minute mark, she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out. We were watching a grown human being have a full-blown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shop...and we hadn't the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it. She'd gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice, unreasonably hot coworker told the security guard:

""A customer is having a nervous breakdown, what's the policy on that?"" 

It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression you'd expect on people's faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP; profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascination.

Eventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to just...staring off into space with her mouth slightly open. We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact, who I assume was her husband. He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store. He didn't explain what was going on, just thanked us for calling him and left with her. I never did see her again after that.

Part of me is amazed I'd forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it.

I usually just clean up/ring up the occasional customer. More often than not I'm just hanging out. This year we were pretty busy and the tent was packed. It was a few nights before the fourth of July and we were going nuts trying to keep up.

  That's when I saw him. **Bubby**. He looked like a normal guy, late 50's, hispanic, balding slightly. But he was far from normal. He wandered in with his oversized flannel and adidas slip-ons and started scanning the big assortments. Like $200 big. He had a different handler every night, most likely family, that would translate for him. 

  He decided he wanted the biggest thing there and was waiting in line. I was on bag duty and as I handed out bags I would occasionally glance up at each customer. I would catch a glimpse of him every time, one spot closer, ready to seal my doom. He'd do this disturbing thing with his mouth, sort of like [this](http://youtu.be/AFbYU1xpR9Q?t=6s) and stare me down. I knew I was in his sights. I was marked. He had me targeted and I wasn't getting away. 

  The line was going slowly and he didn't like that. He would crane his head up to look at me and point to his assortment, he would snap at me and motion to ""come here"". He didn't speak english but he would say ""bubby bubby bubby"". I could hear him over the roar of the other customers, beckoning for me to assist him. I just tried to ignore it and let him get bored of trying to summon me. Then he was next. 

  *Oh Shit*

  Until that moment I didn't know his translators couldn't translate for shit. He slams the assortment down and points to it like an expectant toddler. He then said something in English.

""Free for me?""

  **damnit**

  Like most customers that don't speak English, he had seen the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE banner with (selected items only) in small print and wanted his free fireworks. We tried to explain to him that he needs to buy a product marked for the deal but he wasn't having it. His eyes narrowed and his weird lip thing intensified. He pointed to the assortment again and his translator tried to help. I don't know what she said but he went into a rage so glorious I almost laughed right at him. 

  He started yelling ""**BUBBY BUBBY BUBBY, FREE FOR ME**"" and I thought he was about to chew his own lips off. Eventually he calmed down and overpaid by about $20 for the assortment but he came back numerous times, piss drunk, and bought huge amounts of fireworks and every time he would pull *me* aside and spout ""bubby, bubby, bubby"" at me. Then demand his free fireworks.

So, we're a clothing store and I usually don't have too many interesting stories to tell but this one from tonight was quite interesting.

So the first guy waves me towards him. He has a necklace in his hand and asked me if the symbol on it is a satanic symbol. I'm quite confused and just mutter ""uhhh, no"". He then tells me that ""Oh nonono, I'm no satanist, just askin', don't think that!""

amylondon,21,,11,1rdnjq,,67,"Hi all, I no longer work in a betting shop, having left a couple of months ago due to the unpleasant environment, but I do have some stories from my time there. For the Americans, a betting shop would be called a sportsbook over there, and here they're generally known for containing the... not so nice members of society.

Anyway, here's one story I can remember, and I apologise, I'm not a very talented writer.

So I'm working with my colleague at around 9pm (we shut at 10). The shop is empty which is a rare and pleasant surprise. A man walks in and asks for money to be loaded onto one of the gaming machines. These are machines where you can play virtual roulette, slots etc. and the customers can put their money in themselves or we can do it from behind the counter if they're paying by card. Now, due to strict gambling laws and company policy, if they pay by card their winnings have to be returned to them back onto their card. This is to prevent fraud. 

The man comes up to the counter and quite rudely says he wants ¬£50 on the machine. I take his card and inform him before processing the transaction that any winnings will be put back onto the card he paid with. He does not like this at all, raising his voice to me saying it‚Äôs his money and he wants it back in cash. I say that‚Äôs not possible as its policy. He grumbles for a bit but accepts and plays his game. Two minutes later he kicks the machine and I notice he‚Äôs lost his ¬£50. He comes back up to the counter and wants ¬£100 to be put on this time, I again inform him all winnings are to go back onto the card (I have to for every transaction). He loses it. He starts screaming and shouting at me that I never told him that before. I tell him I did and he previously argued with me about it, and my colleague was next to me at the time and also heard it. He goes on a rant about how I now need to pay him his LOST money back and he wants a refund. He gave me the ‚Äòultimatum‚Äô of refunding his ¬£50 or letting him pay by card and get his winnings back in cash. What the fuck? You want me to give you back money you gambled away and lost? He was shouting at me saying I stole his money, he‚Äôs kicking things and he‚Äôs just generally losing his shit. I had to call the police as he refused to leave, and they escorted him out. They laughed when I told them what happened.

Best part? He was wearing his branded work uniform which is a fairly upmarket supermarket, and I had his full name from his card. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs still been kicking off since I left.

BlueLily54,19,,13,1r5col,,65,"I don't know if anyone remembers my post from a few weeks ago, but [here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p4ejt/so_im_quitting_my_retail_job_today_ive_had_enough/)

I put in my two weeks notice at the big box pet retail store not long after I accepted a job as a teller at a local bank. I just wanted to share something that happened yesterday that was pretty much one of the most ridiculous things I've been asked. Not dramatic, just ridiculous.

So this older woman walks in the door and up to my register. She holds out her hand and says, ""Can you tell me what kind of treat this is?"" She's holding a single treat. No bag, no nothing. Just the treat. Coincidentally I had bought the same kind for my dog before, so I showed her exactly where they were. I made my way back to the register. 

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws). Thankfully I'm out of this place in 24 hours, tomorrow is my last day and I'm only doing pricing stuff before we open. ","Friday is my last day.

biohzrd451,15,,13,1r61h1,,64,"Hello there first time poster long time reader. This is going back to the summer of 2001 when I was pulling a stint in a Mom and Pop pizza joint in a small town.

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box. I mean the dude threw a full on temper tantrum and slung his boxes across the counter making a huge mess.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

Over the past year and a half, I had many things happened, that I still cringe to this day. But far worst was yesterday. It was a typical afternoon, and a little old woman comes up to my register holding a very squirming puppy and some dog food. W is for woman, M is for me:

W- Can I put the puppy on the belt for just a moment while I get my wallet out and pay?

M- Yea sure, I'll turn off the belt. 


Now at this moment, the cute puppy poops and pees all over my belt. Like diarrhea bad. 

M-Ma'am, it seems like your dog has had an accident on my belt. Right there is a 'oops station"" where you can find some paper towels and baggies. 

W- ITS NOT MY JOB TO CLEAN UP AFTER MY DOG! ITS YOUR JOB. YOU GET PAID FOR IT!

M- Ma'am, you are responsible for your own animal, as I am responsible for my own. 

W- NO! NO! ITS NOT MY JOB, I DON'T WANT THIS FOOD, I'M LEAVING.

shadowmanwkp,12,,18,1r1q8g,,63,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around ‚Ç¨2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.

It's a great deal for people who are there all the time and also need/want dishes. But it's caused me so many headaches thanks to dumb customers...

**""I shouldn't have to pay $200 for a plate!""**

No, you shouldn't. You can buy the plate for $6 right now if you want, or you can buy the groceries you normally buy every week and get it for free in like 2 weeks.

**""So if I don't take the stickers, I'm basically paying for the plates for the people who do!""**

...What? How does that even...No, you're paying for your groceries. Exactly the same as if we did not have this promotion going at all.

**""I'll never get anything out of it!""**

You just spent $250. I would hand you 25 stamps, enough to get a free plate right here, right now. But even after I explain that, you still refuse because you can't get a full set all at once from these stamps alone. Even though with how much you spend here weekly, you'd get a full set in a month.

Whenever a family buying groceries complains that it's not worth it because they'll never earn anything, I love to point out my situation:

""Ma'am, my fiance and I are two college students working at this grocery store. We spend maybe $60 a week here at most.

This wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if my job doesn‚Äôt require me entering the back to get stuff to stock the front every 30-40 minutes.    

So Tuesday, trying to be a good employee and do my job, I knock to be let in to grab more stuff to do and this guy makes eye contact with me then waves his hand at me all ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and keeps working at his desk.  I‚Äôm fine if he ignore me cause some of the back room workers do but they pretend not to hear at least but him, oh him made eye contact to let me know that he were refusing to let me in.     

Dear Asshole, 
On Tuesday, you made me cry and feel like shit.  

Because You, with the cushy job, getting paid $20-$30 an hour for essentially doing nothing but put tracking slips on books, decided to refuse to let me, who gets paid minimum wage, to get my work done. Work, that without us doing, you will have to be demoted to doing.  

You made my time increase while being tested because I couldn‚Äôt enter.   

You decided to make a big deal after someone else lets me in by ranting loudly about why he has to let people in.

People who has nicely asked their supervisor for a key and then nicely asked for a follow up less than a week ago but have yet to get one.    

People who appreciatively say thank you to every single person who has opened the door for me in the past.    

People who KNOW they might be inconveniencing you so they don‚Äôt rush you with several knocks.  Just one then patiently wait.    

People who tried within their power to get one but can‚Äôt because of lack of seniority.  So fine, be a jerk to me.  But don‚Äôt bitch at me for something I can‚Äôt do because if it‚Äôs that big of a deal for you to walk 5 steps to be recognized by the automatic door that will open for me if you just wave your arm or pink then don‚Äôt.  Be like the other guys who pretend not to hear me knock, at least they don‚Äôt make me feel like shit and we can pretend to be pleasant around each other because one day, one day when you forget your key, I will remember this moment.  

And today, **oh today.**  My supervisor told us to go eat the stupid sandwiches if we'd like within the next few minutes (when she told us, it was 4:40-50) so at 4:59, there was half a minute left before our shifts were over at 5 and we grabbed a sandwich.  Well, my fellow lowly coworker grab one first and walk off and then I grabbed one, hesitant as I'm a picky eater and the *second* I bit into it, you go **NOW THEY'RE EATING WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING** as you storm off.

trinidadnomad,21,,15,1r9s8q,,60,"I used to work for an electronic store and throughout the years things got kooky and crazy but this incident was one of the funniest we have ever had.

Ok so a couple of years back we started selling Hex bugs and for a while the sales were slow until one day I noticed our hex bug stock was low. I was so happy we were selling them so I decided to check our inventory on them to see how many had been sold that day. I looked and noticed we had sold 3.....but there was 7 missing from the display. I frantically started to search for them but found nothing and at that point told the manager and we decided to start paying attention more to them. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I notice we had some people come in and I noticed a girl went and stopped by the hex bugs for a second then took off. I was curious and decided to check our stock. Sure enough we were short one hex bug. I reported it and we started to keep an eye out on the hex bugs. 

A couple days passed and my coworker spots a girl come in and go to the hex bugs then leave. He calls me and we check the inventory again and sure enough we were missing two more hex bugs. At this point I started wondering why they were disappearing and I started thinking constantly about it. In fact it became a mild obsession and I started looking at all the angles and it was starting to drive me mad. A couple of days later I had enough of it. I grabbed a hex bug and took it out to play with it and didn't see the big deal about it. Here is what it looks like

A simple enough toys it has a vibration motor that makes it run around and that is all it does.....I didn't see anything interesting about it and turned it off then put it back in its test tube packaging. At that point the light in my head turned on and it went ""DING""  Holy crap in a hat Eureka! I took it out of the packaging and turned it on then put it back in the packaging and everything made sense. We had girls coming into our store and stealing the hex bugs because they were cheap vibrators!!!!! I presented my find with my evidence to my coworkers about my theory and everyone confirmed the hex bugs tend to disappear when ever girls would come into the store. Unanimously all of us agreed and decided to put the hex bugs in our view at all times to see if my theory check out to be true.

Later that day we had a girl come in and came up to the hex bugs next to the register. One of my coworkers asked her if she needed help and she darted out of the store. We were amazed and in awe of what had been happening in our little store. We presented my findings to the store manager and she made sure we kept the hex bugs on the counter at all times. She didn't want to ""contribute to deviant behavior"".

unidentifiableblarg,12,,12,1rhfwt,,62,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

So the other night I went to go see the new Hunger Games movie. It was Friday night and it was absolutely packed in the theater. Everyone was behaving themselves and seemed pretty excited about the movie.

Well, before the movie started, a group in the aisle next to me was taking a few pictures with flash. I thought it was mildly irritating, but, the movie hadn't started at that point so whatever.


Queue 15 minutes into the movie. Suddenly, out of the darkness, a really annoying camera flash. Like, the ones that do a few flash blips then a big FLASH. Everyone in that radius violently swivels their head towards him. Nobody says anything. Maybe he wouldn't do it again.


About 10 minutes later. ANOTHER flash. Seriously dude? Do those pictures even come out well? We live in 2013, you know what you are doing it completely fucking rude. I've seen people texting, talking, and even taking phone calls during a movie. Nothing topped that dude.


Well, he did it one more time. I'm not sure if anyone near him tried to say anything, but at that point I was pissed and needed to go get some popcorn anyways. I went to guest services and told them about the camera dude. I just wanted them to tell the dude to knock it off.


The guest service guys were SO AWESOME. They were really apologetic (not their fault!) and they gave me a free movie pass. I honestly didn't care about getting the free pass, but it seemed like they appreciated me saying something in advance. One of the employees goes into the theater and is watching in the back. Of course, Camera flash dude never took another picture for the rest of the movie. At this point, I was almost disappointed that he didn't take another picture. What if the movie employees thought I just conned my way into getting a free movie ticket? And the guy who followed me back into the theater was totally eating dinner. I felt bad about that. Hopefully karma bites that hunger-games-camera-douche in the ass.

KDR3989,9,,11,1ra3wz,,55,"I'm reasonably new to this subreddit (and reddit in general) but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here. I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories. This one in particular is inspired by /u/unmined most recent story.

Quick back story: I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school. After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chain

Our story begins on my first day of work. Which happened to coincide with my birthday . . . 

I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go. At this point I've just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens. After all, spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isn't exactly a dream come true. He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker (lets call him B)as to make sure I don't screw it up. At the time the department wasn't terribly large (at least not as big as it is now) so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall. As far as I was concerned the department didn't exist past the DVD racks, and B and myself were the only employees in the department. As soon as I'm starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what I'm doing I hear a female voice behind me, ""So this is the new guy, huh?""

I turn to see where the words are coming from and I'm completely blind-sided by what stands before me. She is the girl I've been searching my entire life for and I didn't even know it. She stands eye level with me (about 5'7"" if it matters) with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades. Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I can't look in to them for too long in fear I'll never find my way back out. I can smell a faint sweetness when she's near, almost like vanilla, which I find out later is from her body wash. In short, she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever want.

B finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only 2 seconds, ""Yea, his name's . . . what's your name again?""

In that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember, ""It's . . . umm . . . KDR3989!""

She cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle, ""That's an interesting name, where you named after [Insert Actor]""

Around the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work, ""Honestly, I'm not sure. I never thought enough to ask.""

""Heh, well I guess I'll see you around then!""

I wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner. I can still smell vanilla and she's all I can think about for the rest of my shift.

We continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation, except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases. Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasn't a very pleasant person to be around, and the word ""bitch"" was used a few times. It wasn't until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time together.

Our manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink. It was essentially a 5 foot tall, 10 foot wide section of madness. She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days. I find out the day she starts working on it that I'm the one that gets to help from our manager. As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers, ""I know this isn't gonna be a fun project and she isn't always the most friendly person but at least she isn't bad to look at!"" I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of this project.

During this time we talk . . . a lot. About everything from interests and hobbies, to our coworkers, where we grew up and everything in between. As it would happen most of our interests coincide. She reads comics as well, she's into computers (albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker), and we actually grew up only 15 miles from each other but in different school districts.

After that week of work I had decided, she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends. Eventually she stopped inviting the friends. And from there things ran their course. 

This story took place over 4 years ago. I'm very happy to say that I haven't changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her, and she hasn't either. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, retail is awful. The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid, and the pay is never enough to make up for it. We're on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee, but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life forever.

Stachahof,5,,13,1r0j3k,,50,"This is my first time posting here but I've been lurking for quite a while.  I work in a used media store that's privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part, I love it.  I get great discounts, I have plenty of regular customers who I like, and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no big-bad corporate to answer to.

Then there are the drawbacks.  Threats and cursing from customers who don't like their cash/trade offers and just overall rude people.  We also cater to low-income people because our prices are so low (the majority of our stock costs no more than $2.50) and while I don't want to generalize, a lot of them aren't the most desirable type of person.

This particular story happened about a month ago.  The couple in question is fairly regular, though I haven't seen much of them since this happened, but I've never liked them much.  They're usually pretty loud and dismissive.  

This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadn't worked.  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie.  No problem, my co-worker scanned their receipt and credited them $2.67 and they went to shopping.  

When they were finished, they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out.  As I took them, the man kept one and told me he didn't have to pay for that one because he'd brought another back.  We'll call him Dumb Fuck.

Me: No problem sir, I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer system.
DF: But I don't have to pay for it.
Me: You won't, sir.  I just need to scan it.

Reluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies.  I apply their discount and their total ends up being $10.68 for five movies.  The man pays and I think it's finished when he turns to his wife and says to her, not to me, ""She charged me for that movie.""

Immediately I'm irritated that he's talking about me as though I'm not there, but I bite my tongue and explain to him that he'd only paid for four movies.  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that I've over-charged him.  I pick up his movies, which I haven't bagged yet, and stack them on top of each other, adding the cost of them as I go.

""$2.67, $5.34, $8.01, $10.68, $13.35.""  Then I took off the top movie, the one he'd gotten for free, and set it aside.  ""$10.68.  You only paid for four movies, sir."" I smile.

DF: I can't believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refund.

I really have to fight back my anger at this point.

Me: Would you like me to go through the math again for you, sir?

A miracle, he finally addresses me.

DF: I don't need anyone to do math for me, I'm real good at math.

He complains for a couple more minutes, but eventually he takes his movies and leaves, still convinced that he overpaid for them.  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my co-worker to please watch the floor for a minute.  He couldn't stop laughing.","""She charged me!""",63,talesFromRetail

Sigillite,22,,20,1r4dqa,,50,"**Warning, language**

Posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qxrkh/so_long_and_thanks_for_well_nothing/) a couple of days ago about the lovely way the shitty co-owner of the restaurant I used to work at let me know that she was letting me go. but just not scheduling me! lovely. quick recap: I changed my availability for one shift, restaurant doesnt schedule me anymore, condescending owner wont return my calls. 

I called in today, two weeks after the fact, hoping to finally talk to her. Sure enough, she was there. I wish I had written it down so I could give you a more accurate transcript, but honestly, though most of it I was at a loss for words. FYI it is a small restaurant, with 2 bartenders and 2-3 servers on at one time taking 6-7 tables each. 

**Steph:** Thank you for holding this is Stephanie how can I help you?

**Me:** Hi Stephanie this is Dan

**S:** Hi Dan how's it going

**Me:** *thinking, seriously?* I was calling in to see why I wasnt scheduled the past two weeks, and why noone called me to tell me what was going on.

**S:** I wanted to talk to you about that, you see when you changed your availability we couldnt find any other shifts for you. You will have to switch with somebody to work three shifts a week.

**M:** What are you talking about, I opened up my availability when I said I couldnt work thursdays anymore. I am only trying to work three shifts a week, but I can do Monday through Friday nights, Friday and Saturday morning. How can you not find anything?

*At this point I'm not giving a fuck if I keep this job or not, I want this snide mother f-er to explain herself*

**S:** But people already have those shifts, I cant just switch them for you. Most of the other people are full time, so we do set schedules.

*We go back and forth for a while, with me trying to figure out A) Why she cant just schedule me, and move shifts around so that they can get coverage Sundays where they need it and have me fill the gap and B) Why it took her so long to tell me this*

**S:** So youre going to need to have somebody give up a shift so that you can get three a week.

**M:** Can you give me the numbers of the people that work those nights?

**S:** I can't do that, Maryland law won't let us

*BULL. SHIT. Every restaurant I've ever worked at has the numbers posted by the schedule*

**M:** Can you tell me who is working those days, or who is available Sundays?

**S:** No

**M:** So basically, what youre saying is that I have to drive all the way up there *20 minute drive* to talk to the two servers that are on, because I cant switch with a bartender, and talk to them while they're working to see if they would be able to switch with me? Hoping that they're actually available and amenable to working Sundays, and is actually able to discuss it and think about it during a shift.

**S:** Right

**M:**.......ok. *Fuck it* I also wanted to tell you that not trying to get in touch with me about this, neither calling me nor emailing me or even returning a phone call is extremely unprofessional. I've never had a boss do this, especially since you acted like nothing had happened when **I** called **YOU** just now.

**S:** Well the last time you worked I wanted to talk to you about it but you just ran out.

M: Because I was done, we just cash out to the bartender we dont need to talk to you guys. I left because I was finished, I didnt know you wanted to talk to me, why didnt you let me know before I left so that I would stay?

**S:** I was working on a catering order

**M:** Okay, so what, you expected me to just hang around on a saturday, past the time when I was scheduled to be done, when I had plans later that night, on the off chance that you may want to talk to me?? Come on....

**S:**.....Well I am really busy right now so you'll need to come up here and talk to me about this.

**M:** Ok fine, but again, not reaching out or even returning my calls was extremely unprofessional.

*while Im hanging up on her* 
**S:** Ok. Bye


I dont remember being hired as a manager, so no, I dont think that I am going to take care of the scheduling for you. If it was impossible to find one shift that you could change, out of five different days and 10-12 different people, than you just cant do your job. Sorry. There are so many awful business practices at that place they are only saved by the high quality of the wait staff, that she treats like shit, and their awesome food which the other owner is solely responsible for.

Anyways, cut to the present and I've managed to avoid PricklePants for about three weeks. 
He finally manages to come in during my shift. He says the cigarettes he wants, I ring him up, then this conversation happens:

PP: You're the bitch who charged me $5 for cigarettes aren't you?

Me: Well you got these cigarettes and the sign says $4.65 so yes. 

PP: (yelling at this point) You're gonna fucking argue with me?! You're arguing with ME?!

Me: I'm just telling you what the sign says

PP: No! This is what I smoke!! (Holds up an entirely different pack of cigarettes)


He then proceeded to call me a stupid bitch, a liar, and storm out of the store like a man child. 

I'm not allowed to ring him up anymore so the next time he came in I called someone up to the front to ring him up, and without saying a word he again stormed out of the store like a child.

We still had two groups of people sitting in the booths in the back of the restaurant (fast-food chicken joint). One of the tables, a few teenage girls, get up and leave. The other table was an older couple.

As all the employees from the back come up front to see what's going on, we hear the old man screaming ""TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON!"" We tell him the power's out, but he just keeps yelling about how he can't see. Now I know he was older and probably didn't have the best eyesight, but it wasn't that dark. With all the emergency lights, it was slightly less lit than in normal conditions. His wife keeps telling him the power's out, but he keeps walking towards us and yells ""Why don't you just kick us out instead of turning the lights off?!"" I looked at him, and loudly and firmly said ""THE POWER IS OUT."" He turned in a huff and walked out the door.

*Rinse and repeat*

**Second story, same day**

**Oh no it's your fault**

We have different depots that deal with different areas of the country, sometimes sales teams in H/O can change the default depot to something that might have it in stock, problem here is its on the other side of the country and you know can't travel through time and space - Every sales person knows (and it even tells the during the order process) to tell the customer delivery may be a few days later than their confirmation email since we have to get authorisation from a manager to ship it.

We get a call from H/O

Ho: Yeah err I have a customer on the line who was told he was getting delivery today and it hasn't arrived
me: Oh ok what's the details if you please

I check the order and nope, no one said nothing about delivery from our end

H/O: ""Well the customer is expecting it""
(I'm expecting to win the powerball but lookey here)

What's worse is the sales guy just kept saying the same thing, like literally ""Hes expecting it today"" no resolution, no ideas to the point I had to ask ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO""

He says he'll deal with it... 20 mins later we get a call, the customer called. I enter the details to see a note has been put on by our H/O that they told the customer to call us...Yeah thanks for that ass-socks now I get to explain the same thing all over again.

I explain to the customer he needed to wait for the auth from a manager before we could ship it out, he asked if he could cancel his order, I said unfortunately not.

Then. Karma. Came.

He paused and said ""Can I cancel it with them and take it with you?""

Usually we would say no, but I said ""Well if we were to do the order for you we wouldn't need the authorisation"" he replied with ""I demand you do it""

""Anything to keep the customer happy sir"" &lt;- at this point there was no suckyness from his part, he knew that there was a game that needed to be played and he knew that if this was brought to the big wigs he can say he demanded it and I just did what the customer wanted.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is boxes; Shall we begin?**

I‚Äôve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery service.

My job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego. Occasionally, a box would show up that did not belong in my area. Sometimes, it‚Äôs because of a mistake farther down the line, or it could be a bad address (street does not belong in ZIP code), or it could be a major fuck-up caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me, when it did not.

This is about a major fuck up.

At the beginning of the shift, the unloaders (people who emptied out the massive silver trailers) and the ‚Äúpresorters‚Äù (people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts - one of which went to me), were under the impression that a large mail-order company was now in my area. It was not. But that didn‚Äôt stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my way.

When I would get a misrouted box, I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet (if it was small enough). If it was too large, or if the belt near my feel got backed up, the box had to go to one of six guys in my area. This pissed them off when it happened, because they had to touch something that did not belong to them. (technical note: this company is absolutely insane with logistics; they preach the art of touching something a few times as possible).

I did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible. So as the crap came in, I rotated the victim. Everyone except Badass-Ponytail was understanding.

Badass-Ponytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him. Over the course of the first two hours, I got called: asshole, faggot, fucker, mother fucker, pussy, pansy, goddamn piece of shit, mongoloid (surprised at this one, since it required knowing what it meant), blind, inbred, etc). Loudly.

The environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter. It was a dirty, shitty environment, and there was absolutely no decorum. This may have changed over the years, but in this era, there was zero censorship.

Permissive or not, personal or not, I had enough. It wasn't my fault, and there was zero I could do about it. So, I gave everyone else a break and started sending 100% of the misrouted load to Badass-Ponytail. I mean, if I‚Äôm going to get abused, I might as well give him a reason.

Box after box went to him. He very quickly got backed up, since he couldn‚Äôt handle is regular workload on top of the crap. His anger started boil. He was getting truly and sincerely angry. The verbal assault gained volume, and he started calling out for a supervisor. A supervisor did arrive, and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap. So he told Badass-Ponytail to stop being a baby.

At the hour three mark, he exploded. He began throwing boxes at me from about 15 feet away. I shut my belt down, turned around and played wide receiver. He threw, I caught, then stuck the box back on his belt. After a couple minutes of this, I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna die motherfucker!‚Äù

Badass-Ponytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me. He is both larger and stronger than I am, and I knew that if there was any actual violence, I would likely get thrashed. So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shield.

He charged into me, and I thrust the box into his chest, causing him to lose balance. Instead if hitting me, he had to right himself, or he‚Äôd fall about three feet onto a steel grate.

After stumbling, his mind cleared. ‚ÄúOne more fucking misroute and I‚Äôm going to kill you after work.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you, you retarded piece of shit. You‚Äôre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth. As for after work, just try. I‚Äôll fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytail.‚Äù

Now, I said a lot of stuff working here. It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality. I mean, if I saw him waiting for me, I‚Äôd run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back. I hate fighting, and had managed to avoid it since middle school.

But it worked, and he backed down. ‚ÄúLook, hand the stuff out fairly and we‚Äôll be cool. But you keep fucking with me and we‚Äôll have a problem.‚Äù

I punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute, but went back to being ‚Äúfair‚Äù again. No asses were kicked that day.

I sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise. Looking back, I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was. Everywhere else I‚Äôve working in life, both of us would have been fired on the spot. And we would *deserve* it.

PepperAnn90,5,,11,1r4g87,,45,"I am a sales leader in a boutique-style, Swedish-inspired children's clothing store. The area is pretty affluent and educated, so we don't get very many people who have lost all common sense. This is a short story of someone who might have.

I was the sole person on the floor with about 6 customers in my store. I was deep in the process of a return when a lady asked if she could hold something at the register. Being such a small store, I said yes, as we can generally keep track of whose pile of stuff is whose and check them out when they're done shopping.

A few minutes later, I've finished the return and processed a few other transactions when I realize the lady has left the store, and left her items on the cash wrap. No name, no phone number, nothing. Just left. Okay...well, I can hold this for a bit and see if she comes back, I suppose.

Three hours later, she hasn't returned and we sell her items. I warn my relief manager (RM) that this lady might come back in, but I'm not sure. Two hours after that, I leave for the day.

The next day, I come in for my closing shift. RM from the day before had opened, and filled me in on what happened after I left:

Lady comes back and says she has items held for her. Nobody can find them, because we don't have them anymore. The lady got pissy and said, ""Well, the girl with the short reddish-brown hair said she would hold them for me."" (I am the ONLY person who works in my store who matches that description.) Essentially, RM told her that we didn't have any more in stock in the right size, so they could order it or she could wait until another came in. Lady decides against the dress, but RM does so much ass-kissing that she still makes a $600 sale.

I'm trying to figure out how she thought I could hold the items for her with no name, no phone number, and no time she would be back for them. Hell, I've been to department stores that require a credit card number for a hold. SOMETHING. Like, I can't just hold it for ""Short Blonde Lady with Baby in a Sling"". That's a physical description of about 30% of our customers. Ugh.

thelittleblueones,4,,13,1rahas,,44,"A quick one from back in my days as a cashier at a large grocery chain. I was 15 years old and wasn't too invested in the company, it was just a job to put a few dollars in my pocket. That said, I was fairly decent at the customer service aspect and only ever had one complaint. 

A mom and a young child, maybe 5 or 6, came through my lane just to buy the kid a tube of M&amp;MS minis. The kid put the candy and a coupon for a free tube on the belt. I thought it was cute that she was being a big girl and doing the transaction herself. I scanned the candy and the coupon, but the ""free"" coupon didn't take off sales tax, which came to a whopping two cents. When I asked the mom for the two pennies, you'd have thought I'd thrown acid in her face by the look she gave me. The slammed the pennies down, grabbed her kid, and left without another word. 

A few minutes later my supervisor (who spoke English as a second language) came over and asked ""why you no be nice to customer? You be nice to customer!"" I asked what I'd done, and she said the woman had complained about me asking her to pay the two cents. I asked if she would have preferred my drawer be short the two cents.

I meant to go get some reading done this evening, but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and I'm car-less at the moment, so I decided to tell you about a recent story.

I just got done with my Bachelor's this summer. I know, I should have escaped the abyss that is retail, but I'm stuck at home, saving up money to move to the D.C. area at the moment, while also filling out grad school applications, as well as working on big job applications. I'm in a stupid spot and I need money, so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a three-minute walk from home. Score.

For the most part the job is fine, no real horrible people to be found. The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping, so it's fine with me if they like being pricks. They just spent $6 on a f*cking drink. 

Anywho. Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness. I was working the drive-thru window, which, at night, meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot. During a rush there's two of us, as people's drinks go from normal to downright stupid-complicated. But, alas, there's always a button for it.

A nice, shiney $40k+ car pulls up, my last customer in a long line rush. She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chit-chat. Now, for some background, I have the worst baby face. I mean, it's great that I look young, but depending on the person my 28 years looks like 20. I don't wear make-up, drink, or smoke, so I am lacking any pre-wrinkles and I'm chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks. It's fine though, as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly. For this conversation I'll use BAC for the lady, and Me as me.

BAC: ""Oh, are you still in school right now?""

Me: ""Actually I just finished, I'm working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feet.""

BAC: ""Oh, what did you major in?""

Me: ""East-Asian studies."" *chuckles* ""It's kind of useless around here.""

BAC: ""Would you say that you could talk about your major confidently?""

Me: *at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college, or needs a strangely specific tutor* ""Oh, yeah, I can talk for days about culture, history, politics, language, etc for days.""

BAC: ""Have you ever read the bible?""


Me: *shitshitshitshit, here it comes* ""...Well, a bit when I was younger.""

BAC: *with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes* ""When I was in college, my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes, one where God existed and one where he doesn't. Sure, if you're in the box where he isn't there, fine, but what if you're in the other one? Is it really that harmful to believe?""


Now, at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers, and had tuned out the conversation, as she told me afterwards. I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me, but alas, I was trapped.


Me: *remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view, but deciding not to argue at work* ""Well, as a kid my dad let me try out every religion, and I've built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them. If I had to subscribe to anything--""

BAC: ""Some people are really fake, you know? They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area."" *suddenly angry* ""I know a lot of fake people, and they aren't people you should call friends.""

Me: *the fuk?*

This was the most annoying part...

BAC: *suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching* ""What are you going to do after you're done with school?""

Me: ""I dunno, work for the government?""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Take care of my parents and family.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Travel or work abroad.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""I've thought about adopting.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Live my life happily?""

BAC: ""What about after life?""

Me: ""There's nothing.""

BAC: *legitimately surprised* ""And you're okay with that?""

Me: ""Well, yeah, we're not immortal. You live to the best of your ability until you die.""

BAC: *changing tactics* ""When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson, really friendly, but it was fake. People are fake. Then I read the bible. There's something there, if you read it you'll understand.""

Me: ""Maybe one day I'll read it, but it's not--""

BAC: ""Well, you know, everyone has problems, right?""

Me: ""Of course.""

BAC: *surprised for some reason that I've agreed with her* ""Well, how do you deal with problems?""

Me: ""Sometimes slowly, sometimes not at all. I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people. You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again. Some people can't cope and need medications, but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their own.""

BAC: ""My husband used to be addicted to money, sex, and drugs.""


This is about where my patience absolutely ended, my face started to crack a grin. I'm not an arrogant person, but I write, I read, I study constantly. I'm an intelligent person, and I wasn't going to allow her to outwit or -speak me, but I was also trying to be unfailingly polite.


Me: *corners of my mouth twitching* ""Oh yeah?""

BAC: *conspiratorially* ""He used to be the biggest drug dealer in [my home town].""

Me: *holding in my amusement, badly* ""Really!""

BAC: ""Now he's the best husband, utterly faithful, and he read the bible. He's spiritual now, that's proof. You have to--""

And then, like God himself saying ""Jesus lady, shut up"" the drive-thru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel, I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian, and turned away from the window. As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions. My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened. I was a little mortified. I mean, here was this lady with a car worth more than my four-year education, lecturing a girl (lol) who she thought was in the middle of college (~20), working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a, what she thought, excellent education. If she only worked retail, than dear drug-dealing hubby must have paid for that, right? At what point did she have the right to say that I wasn't spiritual? I'm very spiritual, and I have my own views of spirituality. At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs, money, and sex? Not only that, did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the non-religious simply because I told her I was educated? 


Plus she didn't tip that poor drive-thru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool. Seriously.

Toni-Cipriani,3,,12,1rdgs7,,45,"Just a short and small story. I work in a small independent corner/liquor store. Anyways in the later hours of my very slow evening a man enters the store and since I was walking past the area where the door is I just said ""Hey what's up man? How are you?"" To no response and him practically looking through me.

Ahh well,  it happens so I go on about my business and about 4 minutes later after he finishes picking out some beer he steps over to the front counter. The look on his face when he noticed I stepped up behind the cash register (And the fact that I was the only person working in the store that night)  was pretty priceless, he turned a bit red and made sure to try and act somewhat chummy with me.

Him: Oh.... I'm sorry... I totally disregarded you.

Me (mentally) Yeah you sorta did...

What I actually said: Oh no worries man, what can I get you?

Metroidzoid,4,,5,1refmp,,45,"So while it is [this woman's](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qvkqw/i_am_counting_the_days_until_she_leaves/) second-to-last day, I don't have to work with her on the same shift, so I was counting the hours until we no longer shared the same time clock. 

She made those minutes crawl by at an exhausting rate.

But I did two things that, in any normal circumstances, I might not be proud of.  But today, I regret nothing.  The first was near the end of the shift.  Because I needed to count one of the tills, I was vacuuming the front carpets, a task normally done while other cashiers counted cash.  So I started the task about 30 min. early, giving myself time to stop for customers coming up to the register, and for load-outs as well.

She's on her phone.  Again.  She's the damn primary cashier and she's just sitting there!  ON THE GODDAMN PHONE!  I stop what I'm doing, ring up the customer quickly, then bypass every carpet I had started on the far side of the counter, and just started vacuuming all around the gift-wrap table.  Last Day Woman was surprisingly resilient, and managed to keep a conversation the entire time while her voice was elevated enough that I think the loading dock heard it.

The second petty act was while all three off us were on the register.  Well, me and pleasant co-worker started, had the line pretty much under control, but Last Day addressed her own concerns first and dragged over a customer she had been helping (but who wasn't waiting in line) over to the third register.  I warned her that the til had been acting up since Friday, and did not except plastic.  ""Oh, no it's fine.  I've been running transactions all day""

""But those were cash, you can't us-""

""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING""

I left her to it.  In the mean time, the line grew longer.  And longer.  About the same time I hear a voice behind me saying ""I don't know why it's not working"", and then a tap on my shoulder as LD wants me to get off my register so she can ring up her friend.  I could not help but smirk slightly as I told her that I was ringing up people who were already in line, and she would have to wait.

Please for the love of everything don't let this woman extend her 'two-ish weeks'.  What gods have I slighted to die in such company?","I am a petty, petty man, and I hold no regrets",50,talesFromRetail
Sasparillafizz,22,,33,1r3ozm,,45,"Not a great story, but was so ""Your joking, right?"" I felt I could post it so others could share in my bafflement.

Got a phone call earlier today at (Insert specialty gaming store here.) 

Our phone call customer, we'll use PG for Phone guy, called regarding his Xbox1 reserve.

Now, for the pre-orders for the console, we took a down payment as a deposit for the console to make sure you are actually going to pick it up. Otherwise everyone and their grandma would try to 'reserve' on of the new consoles and only a fraction of them would have the money/time/etc to pick it up at launch. These deposits are of course fully refundable if you change your mind. Or if you go buy it from a competitor, ebay, etc. 

Reserved items are held for 48 hours, we will absolutely guarantee it remain in stock that long for you if you preorder. We aren't going to hold it a week, a month, or longer; sitting around collecting dust and shooing away customers who want to purchase the item you can't be bothered to pick up because you put down a 20% deposit months ago. This is ESPECIALLY true with systems and collectors sets, which we hold VERY FIRMLY to the 48 hour rule.

Onto the story!

PG: ""I had a question about the Xbox 1 I had reserved.""

Sasparilla: ""Go ahead?""

PG: ""Well see, I have a bit of a family emergency, and won't be able to pick up the Xbox until tuesday and-""

At this point I cut him off, having done this conversation so. many. times. this day alone; let alone the last week. ""Regretfully sir, the consoles can only be held till 6pm on Saturday. If you don't pick it up Saturday night, it will go on sale on sunday to the first buyer.""

PG is PISSED. ""What do you mean you'll sell it? I paid for it!""

Sasparilla: ""You placed a deposit on the item in question to have it set aside for you. If you do not pick it up within the hold period, we cannot guarantee we will have it in stock when you come to pick it up.""

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!""

Sasparilla: ""How so?""

PG: ""Your supposed to hold it 48 hours! It comes out friday.""

Ah, I see the problem. Not the original problem addressed, but the bone he is currently chewing on. ""We are starting the pre-ring process at 6PM on Thursday. The consoles will be paid for and purchased, but they won't be handed over the counter until midnight. Its to preven-"" 

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!"" 

Ah. A street savvy lawyer here. Sasparilla: ""We can, and are, Sir. We can ring up the products early, the steet date only prevents us from handing the product to customers early to get an advantage over competitors. No matter where you go, you will not get your hands on a Xbox one before midnight. But we can make the purchase any time we please.

PG: ""You can't do that!""

Sasparilla: ""We can, and are sir. Microsoft has never had a problem with us doing this for any of their products in the past. Since the items are being sold at 6PM Thurs, you have 48 hours to pick it up."" 

PG: ""Well I cant get there till Tues."" 

Sasparilla: ""Then your console will be sold on Saturday after six. You ca-""

PG: ""You can't do that! We had a CONTRACT.""

Note to any armchair lawyers, we do not. A deposit is not a purchase of the product, merely that he has offered the payment ahead of the time of exchange. The terms of this are clearly spelled out, and his offer is refundable at any time if an agreement (payment at price at time of purchase) is not made.  

Sasparilla: ""Sir, our terms are very clearly explained. If you do not show up for your purchase it will be sold. There is very high demand for the Xbox 1, we cannot hold it for you till Tues. At best, I can hold it to the end of saturday night.""

PG: ""You said you have to hold it 48 hours!""

Sasparilla: ""We are. From opening Friday, to closing saturday."" 

PG: ""Thats not 48 hours!""

...

Your kidding right? Your killing me here.

Sasparilla: ""From open to close Friday. And open to close saturday. Each day is 24 hours apart. This adds up to 48 hours. We can hold your console till then.""

PG: ""Well I can't make it till tues!""

Sasparilla (silently) /to f-ing bad?/

Sasparilla: ""Do you have someone who could pick it up for you?""

PG: ""I dunno, my friend could."" 

Sasparilla: ""If you pay for the console in full and provide him with the receipt, he can come in before Sat and pick up your console for you. I'll even make a note on the account that another person will pick it up for you with the receipt.""

PG: ""Fine. You better have my damn console for me. I gotta go visit my aunt in the hospital! I shouldn't be punished for this!""

Sasparilla: ""As long as your here before saturday at closing.""

verynotberry,14,,8,1r0rm7,,42,"I've been out of retail for several years, but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia.  I worked in a store in a smaller town, where you aren't always slammed and get to know your customers.  There was one family I'll always remember with fondness.  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it. I looked forward to their visits. These were truly kind, wonderful people.

However, there were also the jerks.  The guy I'm going to tell you about is one of those.  Now, normally when someone would be a jerk to me, I would tend to write it off.  It's not personal, I'm not verynotberry, I'm the cashier.  If it happened every time they came in to the store, that was another story.  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers.  Talked down to us, treated us like idiots, the lot.  But one day, one glorious day, I got my petty revenge.

He came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases.  While counting the change, I noticed a Canadian penny.  This store was in the U.S.  So . . . not legal tender.  I tell coin man, CM, for short that I can't accept his penny.

CM:  What?  Why not?

Me:  Well, it's not legal tender.  

CM:  Why not? 

Me:  Well, this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada, so I cannot accept this.

&lt;bear in mind, I'm smiling and as friendly as I could possibly be&gt;

CM:  What?  That's bull----.  Just take the d--n penny!   (Truly, he was a gifted debater.)

Me:  Well, sir, I would, but outside the boundaries of Canada, this is not legal tender, so I cannot accept this.

CM:  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE!  

&lt;Because I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins, don't you?&gt;

Me:  Sir, if that is true, I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them, but as it stands, I will need an American penny.

(It's important to note that throughout this entire process, he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars' worth of coins.)

CM:  Oh Jesus.  Fine.

He throws a penny on the counter.  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest, kindest, most customer-friendly smile.

Me:  Thank you so much, sir.  Please have a nice day.

Now, if this had been any of our other customers, I would have taken the penny no questions asked because, hey, the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly, so it's easy to miss.  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny, but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel small.

It felt amazing!

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,9,1rhw8z,,58,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Mystic-Spiral,3,,9,1rfdiq,,43,"Greetings fellow retail workers, happy Thanksgiving! 

While we all wait for Thursday/Friday this week I think it would be good for us all to focus on the positive. We have all had them, the customers that make us laugh, smile, or say the inappropriate thing that we ourselves were thinking but couldn't say out loud. 

One of my favorite stories takes place on a Sunday. I'm not sure what it is, but Sundays are awful. No matter where I have worked Sunday has brought out the mean demanding, and crazy customers.

This Sunday was no different. I was working open to close and everyone was as pissy and demanding as possible. I was exhausted and flying on autopilot when a middle aged woman approached my counter to pay for a few items. 

The items she had chosen were final sale pieces. Even though these items say final say in red on the tag I will always remind customers that these pieces can not be returned or exchanged (which of course people try to do at least once a week).  

So I greet this fabulous lady and begin to ring up her selection. I launch into my usual spiel.
""Now these are final sale pieces which means they can't come back or be exchanged.""

Cue the customer throwing her arms up towards the heavens and proclaiming in a loud voice ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T BRING BACK THIS FIVE DOLLER SHIRT? WHATEVER WILL I DO?! OH NO, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL LIVE WITH KNOWING I CAN NOT RETURN THIS!""

I'll admit, at first I thought she was serious and was bracing myself for the onslaught, because that had been my whole day up til that point. 

Then a beautiful thing happened. She put her arms down, smiled at me, winked and said ""I think I will survive paying five dollars for a shirt and not being able to return it.""

I blinked as I processed what had just happened and then I just lost it. I laughed so hard! I rang her up and while still giggling informed her that she had just made my day and won my coveted favorite customer if the day award. She laughed. I laughed. My Sunday got a little better.

A is fairly new - I think she started in September? She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now. Most of the time.

Part of the form is to explain how many points need to be added/deducted, and why, so I asked out loud how many points would get you $50 off. I could have figured it out in my head, but hey, ~~this was a teaching moment~~ I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldn't have to. Turns out, she didn't know how many points it takes to get a certificate. Okay... this is kind of Rewards 101. I ask a few more questions to see what she *does* know. Turns out, she also doesn't know details about how points are earned. This is really basic stuff. Any customer could ask her these questions at any time. So I give her a quick rundown, and then toss an easy one her way.

""How many dollars do you have to spend to get 1500 points?"" She doesn't know. I'm getting frustrated, so I grab some paper and write it down, thinking that'll help her see how simple it is. 10 points per dollar, how many dollars for 1500 points? All you have to do is divide 1500 by 10, but A can't do it. She's starting to get a blank look, and I realize I need to back off; I believe she has the capability to solve this question, but she's shutting down. I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know, and let her go.

A few minutes later, it's time for A's fifteen, so I look around to see where she's gone to. I don't see her on the floor. I'm starting to get a bad feeling. I ask her friend, C, if she knows where A is, and C says she's in the bathroom. Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature. I started worrying that I had been too harsh, and that A was now crying in the bathroom. I'd never made an associate cry before. I watch for A to come back out onto the floor, and the longer I wait, the worse I'm feeling. Finally I see her come out, and she looks composed. I wait a minute to give her some space - I don't want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out - and then head over to see if she's okay and tell her to go on her fifteen. She says she's already gone, so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down. Fair enough, though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break. She mentions that she felt too much pressure, and then says that B, the main cashier, had laughed at her. This is kind of unsurprising, B is one of our biggest troublemakers. I have plenty of other stories to tell about B, but I'll save them for another night.

malnormalish,19,,7,1r9oo9,,40,"So I work at an art craft store and we sell these crazily popular rubber band bracelet looms  along with rubber band refill packs. They come in a multitude of colors but we usually only have 3-4 colors at a time. Every day I have people coming up asking if we have any other colors, which is a valid question. I tell them that no, what we have out is all that there is, and then half of the time they ask, ""Are you sure?""  No, I'm not sure, I'm just pulling that out of my ass...


When I tell them yes, I'm definitely sure, I've seen more people than I would have guessed throw tantrums. I've gotten people asking if I could just double check in the back (No, nothing in the back) and even had a couple people offer me extra cash on the side if I could give them a certain color, trying to bribe me. I don't understand what they want me to do, it's not like I can magically summon the rubber bands out of thin air.


It's absolutely crazy how these people act trying to get these looms. Seriously, we have sold 230 of them in one night. That same night, for the last loom available, I taped a note on it saying ""I'm the LAST one"" and about ten minutes later saw two ladies walk up to it at the same time. It was like a showdown in a movie. They glared at each other before one lady just quickly grabbed it and walked away. The other lady then complained to me about how we should have had more of them, to check when they'll be in (we don't know), yadda yadda.


A couple annoying things to note about this product is that we have moved the display for it from about the middle of the store to quite literally the frontmost center of the store, standing there right as the customers walk in. These customers have to walk past the display directly to my counter where they ask me where the product is. I usually just point and they follow my dead-eyed stare to the display behind them. Then the customer will walk over, pluck one from the shelf, ignoring the neon-colored, bolded signs printed on 8x12 pieces of foamboard stating that no coupons are to be accepted on the looms. The customer then promptly whips out a coupon. When I then tell them I cannot use said coupon, most of them are annoyed but okay, while others tell me it's bullshit and storm out threatening to never come back to the store again,  saying that ""The coupon is the only reason I came!"". 



Of course all of you know that people do not read and refuse to even attempt to observe their surroundings, blaming poor cashiers for problems out of their control, so my tale should not come as a surprise. 


So to end this rant I just wanted to ask what products sold at your place of work give you the most frustration. This loom kit has been probably the worst to deal with for me. I see people get insanely angry about these things-- it's sort of funny but also very horribly frustrating.

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching cause' they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left. The other sales person still got the sale etc, but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her, still want my 2500 back though.",Is that stealing?,44,talesFromRetail
Lightfairy,4,,7,1r445p,,34,"Been posting a few stories. You can find them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=author%3ALightfairy&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Many many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier. This supermarket was in a large shopping centre. Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was 33 years ago. Wow! Time has flown! 

This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt. Bomb threats had been made to various stores. We, the staff, thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work. The alarm would go off, we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time, we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again. 

We were having a bomb scare every couple of days. All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened. 

Then, in the space of nine days three stores were bombed. The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve. The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest. 

Cue this story. Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert. A lady comes up to my check out. Two carts of frozen goods. Chickens, 4 litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine. I start putting the order through. Keep in mind this was back in the dim, dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from. No scanners back then. I was slaving away, making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off. 

By this time we all knew the drill precisely. Pull the cash draw, throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately. We did not muck around any more! So, with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit, I pull the draw and prepare to exit. 

'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?' I hear screamed at me. My customer with all the frozen goods. 

I turn to her and say 'Would you please exit the store immediately. It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent events.'

She is having none of it. 'What about all my food. Only part of it is rung up and I need it. You have to finish my order. It will only take 5 or 10 minutes.'

With thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say, 'Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta here!!'

Thankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time. I jump on the train and head 1. 5 hours west. Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home (it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked) as they were having a bomb scare as well!! Total of two bomb scares in one day for me!

I heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store. As for that ladies '5 or 10 minutes'? They received only a 10 minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve. They managed to evacuate over 2000 people before it went off. No one got hurt. They have never charged anyone over the event. I left the job shortly after. This kind of ruined my taste for working check out. 

TL;DR Ice cream and bombs don't go together. Just ask my customer.

BraveSouls,10,,10,1rfyes,,35,"**Some background:** I work for a privately owned consignment shop. For those that don't know, it's a second-hand shop (though we also sell new items), but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them. We take the items in and once they sell, we get a commission off the sale, and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month. We sell both in store and on eBay.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  

This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter. She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it. I smile thinking that's very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter. The greater majority of our big furniture is right in the middle of the store when she walks in so she looks around while I go back to my laptop to continue working on an eBay listing.  
[](/spacer)      
[](/spacer)  
She asked me random questions here and there about the different items then finds her way to the back where we have a large screen TV for sale. She calls my attention and the conversation went something like this:

**Old Lady:** How much for the TV?

**Me:** $30

**OL:** Okay I'll probably take it. Does it come with a remote?  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)

My boss, who was processing item drop offs, overheard and said there wasn't one with the TV but we had a separate remote next to it. It was one of those big button universal remotes that likes to think bigger is better (Note: I know why they're really that size). At this point she told me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it. I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her I'd be right back and to feel free to look around more.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
I noted the brand of the TV (can't remember what it was) and went to my laptop with the remote. I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didn't have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV. I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it. I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better. The whole process took about 20 minutes, including the other questions she had about stuff in the store. She was very grateful and purchased the TV, remote, and a wall plaque.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The next trick was getting the TV into her car. This wasn't a flat screen. It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie. It was also very heavy. So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car. Silly him doesn't have a dolly so I'm looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements. I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little. I'm worried it won't fit but he is unfazed. He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space. Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV. He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didn't want to come back inside.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
**OL:** So now what?

**Me:** I'll just get your name and number and we'll put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it up.

**OL:** Okay, but what about my money?

**Me:** Huh? (Thinking *'uh oh'*)

**OL:** Can I get my money back? I don't know if I'll have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get home.

**Me:** Well, we certainly will hold the TV for you until you're ready to pick it up since you've already paid for it. We won't be able to hold it for your otherwise. (It's worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV. But as it was only $30 and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items, he doesn't allow deposits for items anymore.)

**OL:** I know, but I'm worried about getting it out of my car. Can I just get my money back?

**Me:** *'Oh boy.'* I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The shop has a no returns policy. My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if it'll work or not but he's otherwise firm against returns. This is due to the nature of the business. Someone pays for a consigned item, we send a sale check out to the consignor, then that person decides to try to return it afterward isn't exactly good for business. Either way, I couldn't give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story. He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant, yet still nice about it, so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote. She didn't ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldn't have anyway. She thanks us and leaves.   
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation. At the very least we didn't have to move the TV. It's still sitting in the shop looking for a home. Poor thing.

So I go to my gallery and...huh? There's a video in my download file? That's weird, because I have never downloaded a video in my life on my phone (I probably wouldn't even know how to do so). I click it and...BAM! A whopping 17 minutes of gay porn. Wow, okay, so THAT'S something my adolescent eyes didn't want to see. I immediately start trying to think of where and HOW this video could have gotten downloaded on my phone when...wait, this video was uploaded last Saturday at 4:40 pm? That's weird, I worked an 11-7 shift last Saturday, which I remember pretty clearly because it took up my entire afternoon. So the next step is to go check my internet history and..wow, how WEIRD. The only internet history I have is from two separate dates, 11/22 (from last night when I was trying to look up something for a friend), and 11/19, when I was looking up someone's address because I needed it for my National Guard papers. I've used the internet a lot in the past six months I have my phone, and I've never deleted my internet history before, so...huh. It seems to me like somebody went on the internet, found a gay porn, downloaded it on my phone, and deleted my internet history so I wouldn't find out. Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed. I like to think I'm a well liked employee, especially by the managers, but I know some people don't like me because I'm 17 and receiving training to become a manager, even though I've only worked there for six months while other people have been there for years without a promotion. The video source seems like it comes from the internet rather than a text message, and even then, I would never download a multimedia file from someone I don't know, and I haven't received any texts like that, ever. So yeah. I'm probably going to talk to the store manager about possible sexual harassment even though it's going to be hard to find out who did it, and I'm probably only going to take about $5 with me to work at all times because if someone is going to go into my purse and download porn onto my phone, who knows what else they might do?

Takeabyte,8,,8,1r3uuj,,34,"The former VP of a computer company's retail division had a lot of policies that were intended to improve the customer experience. He was a strong believer that we sales people could deter thieves simply by talking to them and that having security measures like empty boxes of software, door alarms, and fake products were nothing but an annoyance to customers and would ruin the vibe.

Shout out to /r/JealousyGrey and his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r24y4/they_do_know_theyre_fake_right/) that reminded me of this gem...

The worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves. I worked in a much smaller store than most, the shelves were only about 20 feet away from the door. At any given time, there would be $50,000 to $100,000 worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had. Everything ranging from the full version of design software, productivity software, portable hard drives, headphones, etc. Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe. Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard. Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate (like a grocery store) so we were required to put products where they told us to put them. For example, when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space, we'd have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display. It was madness. Over the years though, they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took over..

The worst for us was a video editing program. It cost $1,299 and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets, but it also made it way easier to grab and run with. Anyway, a box of that would go missing *every week!* It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell! We'd look over, notice it was missing, ask everyone working, usually only 5 or 6 of us including one technician and one manager (it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once) anyway, we'd ask everyone if they sold it, and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it. We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf instead.

So, life goes on and time passes. The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again. Meanwhile, a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up. One time, I was playing billiards in their garage and there's this one guy who was there because he was a [kleptomaniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store... I couldn't believe it. I was playing pool with the guy that stole about $20,000 worth of software. He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair. People almost got fired for that shit! It was crazy. I wanted to punch the guy in the face!

Oh well, he did go to jail for a couple years and [I whooped his butt at pool](http://i.imgur.com/QqHzZ.gif). He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things. Looking back at it now, it obviously didn't effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gear.

**TL;DR**: Someone stole a *lot* of software from the store. I met him years later and beat him... at playing pool.

I have *soooo* many other stories from working that store for so long, I'll tell you guys some more later. For now I'll just wish you a safe holiday season, stay strong, and eat a breakfast.

meguriau,19,,14,1refgz,,33,"Hi TFR! Today's [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens. I was really happy with myself but don't have any coworkers to share the moment with! Here goes (: 

 **Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

The weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day, overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain. As a store specialising in hats, this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers. On quiet days like these, I typically wind up 'gardening': this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but, rather, a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave. It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first. Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be, flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike. As a completionist, the process invokes feelings of frustration, rage and self-pity. 

After this ordeal, I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break. This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance, is quite elevated so that people can't peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need be.

One bite into a delicious banana muffin (baked by my mother), the sensor by the door went off. I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water, emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple, poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares. Let's call the man DHS for designer hat snob. DHS and wife, it so seemed, had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option. Pet peeve #1. Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation. He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointment.

**HB:** EXCUSE ME. YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATS.

The brand does stock men's hats. In fact, there is a display window showcasing the more popular men's styles which he had clearly missed. In some ways, it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately. Unfortunately, this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly **male** models wearing similar hats in the backdrop, some of them topless for good measure. Pet peeve #2.

**M:** We do stock men's hats. They're just up the back, near the counter and to your right.

This appeared to pique his interest. Without so much a thank you, DHS and wife scuttled over to the men's section. Pet peeve #3. I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing inside.

DHS rams the nearest ivory-white $325 panama hat on his head.

**DHS:** It's too small.

**M:** The men's panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yo-

**DHS:** -grunt-

I continued to give him the best smile I could muster. Pet peeve #4.

DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips out.

**DHS:** Ridiculous! This is more expensive than a Borsalino! (For those of you that are unaware, Borsalino is a Italian-made designer hat brand)

He stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount. To be completely honest, I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry (but of course, I wasn't going to let my ignorance be known). Knowing I wouldn't get a sale from him anyway, I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile. Without anything to argue against, the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance. 

I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin. it tasted like victory. I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face. 

Later during the day, I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats. My findings were interesting. For his statement to be true, there were two possiblities.

1. Yes, the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats. However, the hat he was referring to was a papier hat (‚Ç¨154 or about AUD $230), basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm. The panama hats Borsalino sold were in the ‚Ç¨280+ range (~AUD $420+)

2. Currency conversion means nothing to him and, therefore ‚Ç¨280 = AUD $280.

DrChiefChef,10,,9,1r31cw,,34,"This tale (also my first) comes from a land of happiness and joy, right? no? okay I lied it comes from the place where Dreams go to Die. 

Ever since I was younger I always wanted to work at this theme park here in Florida, I mean I always thought it would be so cool, so when the acceptance into working for this company came I jumped on it. I've been here since May and when I thought I would be working in a kitchen or something related to my major of Culinary Arts, I was wrong. 

I currently work at one of those Popcorn and Ice cream wagons you typically see in theme parks and normally I can get through a day just because I love the people I work WITH. This is not the case of last Monday.

(technically this is retail related cause I do sell some merchandise things)

Mondays shift was from 5:45pm to 12:15am so overall not too bad. I was put at a cart that most wagons close With or Around Park closing time so I was pretty confident that I wasn't closing anything (Closing is a bitch to do when you have closed 90 percent of every week that you work, especially popcorn wagons) I get in and see my name on the closing list as closing Popcorn 1, at this point my heart sinks because that means I wont be getting out of here till at least 1am. 

The day goes by alright, until about 10:00pm (wagon closes at 10:30 for some weird reason when park is open till 12)
Here are a few minor things that just built up

* People decided that it was okay to throw money at me when paying for something
* When I ask how someones day is at least say okay or good don't ignore that I asked and just start with your order, believe it or not I do care how your day is going
* A guy came up and cut my line during the middle of a transaction with another guest and asks what happens if he dropped his frozen lemonade, well normally we would just give him a new one but since I had a hunch he was straight up lying to me I asked some questions; such as Where he dropped it (he wasn't too sure where they were) and how long ago he bought it and where (like 20 minutes ago and from this cart but not from me; huh thats funny I've been here the WHOLE DAY no break for me yet) and he said he ""thinks that their were three that dropped on the ground"" I told him without the carton or lid or some proof I could not just replace 3 free lemonades. 

(Note: I didn't even call the managers because I knew that they would just give in and give him the 3 free, I really didn't care at that point though)

And the grand prize of my shitty night ended at 10 minutes before closing. This lady comes up too my wagon and wants to buy two 12 dollar popcorn souvenir buckets so I go and grab them and start to fill them while she fishes out her card (more efficient this way, not practical I know) 

So I come back after filling these buckets and she's trying to pay with this feature that the theme park has for resort guests that is on their wrists. well it wasn't accepting her pin so I asked for her back-up which is an actual card that  they are given at check in and told to keep with them at all times because they are still beta testing the wristbands. she is all annoyed because apparently our 3 button wasn't working to enter her pin with (funny been working all day lady!) and so her husband decides he's just going to pay cash and I tell him the total. 

In the middle of me saying your total is 24 dollars the woman interrupts with ""you do have bags for these right?"" (No we don't we are a popcorn stand, we do provide handles for you to carry them with and they have lids) I tell her ""no unfortunately we don't but if you turn around and go to them they do""(literally its maybe 5 steps away there is a cart that sells merchandise stuff that has bags)  In the middle of that statement the crazy old bitch says ""are you fucking kidding me"" I just stare at her at this point she keeps rambling on about how ""fucking pissed she is that I don't have any fucking bags"" and that since I don't have any bags she will not be buying them, knocks one of them on the ground and walks away.

JeebusClyste,19,,14,1r9uxu,,29,"   A little background: I work on a golf course at a nice country club in my area. We have some stellar employees and some who can be a pain in the rear. This story is about the latter. 
   So to start things off, it's important to know that 95% of the employees on the golf course dip (if unfamiliar, it's like chewing tobacco, but you don't chew it, you just let it sit in your lip.) I've never had a problem with giving a dip to a friend if they've run dry, but one employee NEVER has his own supply, and it's quite annoying to feed his addiction. To make matters worse, he has gotten to where he just takes pinches from my can of Copenhagen without asking me (I don't keep my can in my pocket because it can get uncomfortable at times). If you're a dipper, you know what a pain that can be.
   After multiple attempts of telling him to cut that out, he still continues his thievery. So I devised a simple, yet effective plan. I brought two cans of dip to work: one empty and one full of sweet tobacco. Whenever I would finish a dip, I'd put it in the empty can instead of throwing it in the trash. Eventually, the empty can filled up with nice, already used dip. So I left it out where the employee (I'll call him Bob) could see it. 
   I noticed Bob had a nice fat dip in his lip. I checked, and sure enough, the can filled with my saliva tainted dip was about half empty. He'd been using it. Marvelous. 
I asked him how his dip was. 

""It tastes different man, it's less bold than it usually is.""

To which I replied: ""oh yea? That's because that can was full of re-dips. So you basically just had my mouth in yours.""

""Dude that's so nasty!"" Replied Bob. 

""I told you not to take my dip.""

He was chalk white. I thought he was going to throw up. Maybe that'll teach him to buy his own dip, and stop stealing out of my can.

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

Toni-Cipriani,11,,7,1r6mbw,,30,"This isn't so much a tale as it is something I've been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent 

I work for a small independent corner/liquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the area.

I have worked for retail chains too, namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain.  

Some pros I've been noticing are that working for an independent store:

-Much more laid back on certain things, have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please. Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have ""tabs"" when they are short on money

-Smaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful. 

-I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond, but it's more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers. Don't have to worry about things like returns, etc

-I  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop. 

-I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeks.


A few cons I've picked up on:




-The owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every 2 days pretty much

-No benefits like health coverage or anything

-No holidays off, only 4 people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stone.

-Realistically speaking I probably have alot less job security,  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel I'm well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly. 

My work doesn't have things like ""write ups"" it's what the owner wants at the end of the day. 

-This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop, but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have. I'd probably have to either ignore it or leave, people close to the owner are essentially untouchable I'd imagine.

 Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope. ",Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain?,37,talesFromRetail

Gimick,8,,11,1r0n8k,,28,"I work at an office/warehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving. We are technically a distributor, so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases, but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture, we also answer calls about defective merchandise. 

In the industry I work in, almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we make/distribute. We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise, where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund. Fine. It's no big deal, we usually just replace it. 

I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product. I go through the motions to make sure it's not just some kind of user error, and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem. She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new one.

I ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address. Well, naturally I have to ask about it. It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well. It is odd, but not unheard of, so I let it go.

After I get the information I need to process the replacement order, I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product. At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two. Hmm.

I assume she meant her daughters order, and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order, and that both would arrive on the same day. She corrected me, telling me that is not what she meant.

She then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with. I try to figure out why, which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she bought.

I repeatedly try to get her back on track, as I would rather not dally on the phone all day. Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves two.

Apparently instead of calling when her item broke, she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item. It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement, but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item. That is speculation, of course.

Either way, she felt since she bought a second item (which works perfectly, according to her), I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new, less expensive one. 

I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people, but to me, the math is off. Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her, as she purchased the item through a retailer, we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situation.

Am I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base? Is this sort of compensation common in other industries?

I work at a big-box retail store, specifically in the Electronics and Wireless phones department. And while there are stories galore I can talk about (and I may in the future), there is one I need to tell you all about now. This one customer used to come in on a regular basis and shop, then scream and yell at employees claiming that they are stealing from her and cheating her. Mind you, the police have been called in on a few occasions and have even had to subdue her on at least one occasion for trying to start a fight. This becomes even funnier when you know what she looks like: early 60's and about 5' tall: the small spitfire type. 

Anyways, during the past year she has come in and not started a screaming match with my management team, but her store visits have gotten, in the words of Alice, ""curiouser and curiouser"". The last time she came in I was resetting our new release DVD shelving to make way for the next day's releases with my co-worker ""Josie"". In comes the customer and stands 10 feet away from me and ""Josie"". She calls to us: ""Excuse, please; you help me? Now? Now?"" I look over to her, mutter a few choice words under my breath, and ask ""who, me?"" ""Yes, yes. Come, quickly..."" So I get up, say a little prayer, and come over. 

ME: What can I help you with today?

HER: Can I ask you a question?

ME: Sure! What did you need?

HER: Are you sure I can ask? (Motions over to ""Josie"") Can she hear us?

ME: (Confused) Um, no. She can't hear us. What did you need?

ME: Uhhhhh..... No?

HER: Are you sure? You sure you no crazy people?

ME: No; I'm not crazy, she's not crazy.

HER: Oh. OK. Here's my question...

And proceeds to ask me the same question about her phone for the next half hour; I answer in every way possible besides making puppets and acting it out, and eventually getting her phone company's tech support on the line to help me out. After she grabbed the phone from my hand and began gabbering on and on to the guy on the phone, she left; not really happy about the answer she got. When I picked the phone back up, the guy on the other end sounded like he needed a cigarette break and told me in no uncertain terms that I was correct in my explanation and that, if she doesn't heed our advice, she may get a disconnection notice very soon because she didn't listen.

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Eventually they stopped hiring felons after they hired someone fresh out of county jail and she tried to unionize the store &amp; start riots against the managers.
There were a few winners that stick out in my mind from the 3 years I was  there while in high school &amp; college.
One lady was a dominatrix/ordained minister &amp; she hung up clothes at a thrift store. She always hit on the younger guys...like high school/college kids that worked there and that were customers. She was in her 40s, and looked like she had a lot of bad botox done to her face. She would have days where she would be depressed &amp; one of my friends tried to make her feel better &amp; she yelled in the aisle ""I WAS ONCE RAPED IN FRONT OF MY TWO SONS."" She used to work with part time crew (so basically the college/h.s. kids, some of them being underaged) &amp; she would pick up random stuff in the store &amp; tell the guys how it could be a sex toy. For example she picked up a flyswatter, said it's the Texas Flyswatter, pretended to slap one of the guys in the ass &amp; said ""What's your number?"" She wasn't allowed to work with us after that &amp; eventually got fired.


This one lady was straight up disgusting. She was in her late 20s, early 30s &amp; looked like she was 16. I'm not 100% sure if she was on drugs, but overall she looked pretty cracked out. She always started drama. For instance, one time she wanted other employees fired so she smeared her shit on the bathroom wall &amp; tried to blame it on other employees. Apparently her plumbing stopped working in their apartment so they shit in buckets &amp; poured it on the floor when she &amp; her family got evicted. Her kid was always sick. When she got fired from the thrift store she got hired at the local bakery...



There was a creepy man that was known as the ""shoeman"" because he handled the shoes. He was missing teeth &amp; always hit on all the women that worked there. He always made me uncomfortable. He would be hammered while on the clock half the time. I remember when we added a charity to our store, people from the charity came and had a little party to promote their charity. The shoeman was pretty wasted and shouted stuff at the heads of the charity during their presentation. He eventually got fired &amp; arrested for stealing from the woman who smeared shit on the wall's purse.
There was a lot of drugged out people in general. People coked out &amp; pill poppin like crazy. One lady used to smash a 40 oz on her break in her car &amp; do lines off her steering wheel. Another lady, who worked there for like a week, used to ask the employees if they were drug addicts. She used to be like, ""I love drugs: coke, PCP, oxycotton, you name it."" 


One lady just topped them all. We called her Crazy Cari. She was in her 40s &amp; worked with all the high school//college kids part time. She didn't do shit, I hated her on busy days. But she was pretty batshit insane. She used to come into work fucked up all the time. Our manager lived in the same apartment complex as her dealer I guess. Crazy Cari would look in her windows for her when she was all fucked up. She once came into work and was like ""I took a Xanax bar &amp; I just drank an energy drink to reverse it."" She used to just walk up and down the aisles looking confused, barely cleaning up. We called her ""Peanut"" in the beginning because we found her hiding in the production room of the store eating peanuts. Her first week, she fell asleep in a rocking chair that was on the sales floor towards the end of her shift. I couldn't comprehend why the kept her besides entertainment purposes because she was so crazy. She used to talk to the high school girls about how beautiful ballsacks were and she confided in one of the girls that the shoeman came over to her apartment and basically raped her. One of our supervisors wouldn't schedule her a lot because she would always slack off. Crazy Cari would come in &amp; yell at her saying all this random shit like ""My mom's gonna die &amp; I'm alone."" We met her mom, she was fine. She was never alone when she came to visit, she always had gross looking drugged out men with her. We brought this to the attention of the manager because she was threatening towards to the supervisor &amp; employees. He ignored us. She eventually got fired...for firing a gun at the stuffed animals.

believeinsherlock,5,,4,1re3dl,,26,"So I guess I just need to get a bit off my chest and also because I thought I'd share what I have to deal almost every week. Sorry if this is worded weird, I'm not the best story teller. 

I work in a printing store. It's also a small store so we don't have many staff members. 

There are two people who come in who always create a ruckus, take up a bunch of space while ordering their prints, and generally become an annoyance. When they pick up their prints, they will show us old emails or old print outs of promotions and expect us to give it to them for that price. They have done this to ever single employee in the store as well. 

Today, they came in to order some products. There was one that was on sale a week ago, but the sale ended. After ordering it, (actually submitting the order through so it makes it a hassle to cancel) they came up to me and said that the total was too expensive. Not to ask about the price or anything, just to tell me it was **too expensive** and it was cheaper last month, and to give them the price from last month. When I told them that was not possible since the sale was over, they insisted on showing me the email saying it was discounted. When I pointed out the ""ends on"" date, they insisted that the manager said that they could have the price. 

I have a really great manager who doesn't mind us calling them if we need help on the weekends. So I do, and I explain the situation. They said no, and also that they had to pick up their order today that they had previously ordered. 

I'm not sure where else to add it, but I'll tell the story of the nicknamed ""promotion order"" now. We had a promotion going on for a certain size of product. They ordered a bunch of the wrong size, and then said that they made a mistake. When they ordered it, I had gone up to them a couple times to tell them what the promotion was for, and how to change the sizes to the right one. They dismissed me (rudely, might I add) every single time, telling me they knew what size they were getting. So when it comes time to pick up, they tell me that they picked the wrong size and it was my fault because I should have told them. Then they demanded they get the prioducts for that price because it was smaller than what the promotion was for Sorry bud, doesn't work that way. 

So back to today, I tell them that they need to pick up all their products today. It's been a few weeks. So I ring it through, and again I get a giant hissy fit in my face. They're screaming when there's a bunch of other customers in the store that it's not fair and basically insinuating that it's our fault they can't afford everything. Then they also started yelling at us because they had forgotten something of theirs in the store, we could not find it, so we should reimburse them. (It's not our fault you forgot something *two weeks* ago and now it's gone missing.) After my co-worker calmed them down, they went back to ordering more products. That they would probably not pay for. ",The reoccurring nightmare customers.,30,talesFromRetail

ixiduffixi,4,,3,1r5xvj,,24,"So I was reading through another user's lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own. 

In my teenage years, my first job was working for the ""blue vest mafia."" My job description was something along the lines of ""Customer Service Specialist,"" which amounted to cart pusher, cashier, stockman, and basic maintenance. Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader. This tale involves one of those nights. 

When I worked on unloading my shift started at 3 p.m. We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse. The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver, and driven around the building to the warehouse. There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside. The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrance's sidewalk. This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door. This most commonly took place during store hours. (Not all of them are 24hrs.) Any way on to the story.

One day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock. This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour. Then the forktruck didn't return. I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse. When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight. I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off. The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone. I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer. They had apparently been talking for quite some time, because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office. When I asked what happened, my coworker got very, very upset. To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area. 

What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down. The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance. Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it. I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hours.

**BONUS STORY**

Another tale of the blue vest mafia. 

One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink, giggling, while his friend was in the stall also giggling. I took my time using the restroom, waiting them out, which eventually worked. While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something. 

After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies, sinus medication, and dvds. I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras. The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didn't stop until they were well outside. We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids.

ScaldingSoup,5,,5,1rha57,,27,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

When I got to work, I was able to see a line of 15 people waiting outside the front door. By the time we were able to open the front door (30 mins later), a crowd of 50-70 people ran through the front doors. I wasn't able to get to the safety gap fast enough, so instead I had to run from the crowd to a safely open area to avoid being trampled.

I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

dichotomies,9,,29,1r2lgs,,18,"Here‚Äôs a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank (not BoA). It happened several years ago. 


The story starts about a week prior in a dream. I rarely remember my dreams, but this one stuck out to me. I remembered many details, from how things were said, and the feelings expressed. I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream; it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up. 


Fast forward to ‚Äútoday.‚Äù I sit down and help a 20 something customer (‚ÄúJohn‚Äù) who is sorting out his dad‚Äôs accounts. John‚Äôs dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas. A semi plowed into him. As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it. But, moving on. We have paperwork to do. I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department (I faxed it to them). As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son (John) and daughter (‚ÄúSarah‚Äù) beneficiaries (POD = payable on death). This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank. After having the death certificate approved by the legal department, and verifying John‚Äôs ID, I start to talk to John about his dad‚Äôs accounts. I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks, ‚Äúone made out to each of you.‚Äù 


Now, this is before smartphones and he doesn‚Äôt have the number for his sister on his phone. I think it was because she had just moved or something. John had an address book with him and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs in here. Let me take a look.‚Äù


It was at this point that it all clicked into place for me. It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open. I knew, for at least the next minute, exactly what was going to happen. I have never had this sensation before, or after. Normally I get this feeling after something happens (d√©j√† vu). This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyes.


He looks through his address book and can‚Äôt find his sister‚Äôs number. A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things, or where he wrote things down, so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number. I have to bite my lip to not say anything. I KNOW that his sister‚Äôs number is right in his address book. I am so confident that I want to say, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs in there. Look again.‚Äù I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son, bereaving the unexpected death of his father. John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit, then looks again in his address book. He finds it this time. 


I honestly can‚Äôt remember why we needed to call her (this was about 10 years ago), but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterday.


As I told this story you might have been thinking, ‚ÄúBut this sounds trivial and minor, what gives?‚Äù Well, I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough, and I knew it while I was experiencing it. That is kinda freaky. 


I am an agnostic, and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open. Just thought that I‚Äôd share with you guys. Thanks for reading.

So this is more of a question than a tale. It's my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards. 




I work in a corner store in the south. A guy comes in and wants to put 300$ on a Green Dot card. He gives me a handful of 20$'s that reeks of weed. No biggie. I don't care where you get your money. I ring him up. Have a nice day. 




He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesn't work. I try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong. I again try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. And let me just say now that he was very, very ""southern"" so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too. 




I go to lunch and when I get back he's walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because ""I obviously don't have any money since this card screwed me over"". I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store.  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check. I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that I'm glad they'll fix it for him. He walks back to his car and I think ""gee, that's a pretty expensive car for a for a guy who's barely 20"".  But whatever. Lucky guy I guess. But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot. 





Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot. He comes back in and gets another 300$ Green Dot since the other one was bad. I don't understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesn't have money for cigs. But I don't ask questions cuz I'm new to this job and I just do what I'm told. He buys it and leaves. And then sits in the parking lot for another hour. I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes. I think that maybe he's just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I don't want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed. (I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid).  




Well. The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at 150$ a piece. But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they aren't together. I'm just really weirded out because they're acting like they don't know each other. Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour. I don't mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldn't worry about it. 





The guys leave. I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because there's a green dot limit. 




So....what was this guy doing?

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

So this morning, I haul ass out of the house and spend exactly 10 minutes nomming down a slightly stale frosted blueberry donut (which later made me sick to my stomach) and some reconstituted from powder orange juice with my son so that I could go down and work the book fair.

I'm standing there, bagging stuff up for Mrs. BorgImplant (the librarian) when a dad comes up to me.

Me: Hi. How can I help you?

Random Dad: Yeah..do you happen to have the Lego minifig that goes with this?

And he hands me one of these large Lego minifig dictionaries (we have several--regular general minifigs, one that's Ninjago and a Harry Potter one). Now the minifig dictionaries/encycolpedias generally have a cutout bit on the front cover that has a plastic container inside that contains a minifig.

Only with this particular dictionary, the minifig has been taken out. It's not difficult to do, to be honest. It's designed to be easy to open for the kids, I guess. Since the minifig was ripped off, we offered to give the dad a $5 discount off the price (it was $40) but he declined and I shoved it in the back with the rest of the books that had shit ripped off them. We get a good number of books, mostly paperback, that have cheap crappy jewelery attached and those things get ripped off all the damn time.

Mrs. BorgImplant took the theft in stride but I was kind of miffed because that was $40 bucks we could've made but didn't get to because some kid had to be a Lightfinger Louie.

copisreallybad,4,,8,1rhulb,,19,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

Greenwallets,10,,6,1r52ex,,15,"Hey guys. So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company. Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer, which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space. 

The issues we're experiencing, largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there. They're most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time (benefits, base pay + commission) as the assistant manager for this new employer.  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks, and I've had associates/managers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer. In a tone that makes it feel as though I have ""betrayed"" them in some way. 

I know it's jealousy from the associates, but it's affecting our relationship with the retailer. There's a very distinct ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us. We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isn't buying a cellular device or related accessory. Specifically, there is one associate who has made rude comments about my manager(s) and I in our vicinity, in addition to physically trying to walk through me. I should mention she did this when I worked there as well- she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there. Did I mention she's 28?

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment, and how you went about rectifying the situation. I should say that my manager isn't likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role. She's also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer. She's too much of a sweetheart, I'm a cynical realist when it comes to this store.",(Meta) how do you deal with a toxic work environment?,21,talesFromRetail

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

TaterSaladDelta,9,,8,1re9xa,,12,"  OK, so this is basically the climax of my time at the tent. The next two stories aren't quite as grand but they are funny. 

  So this was a few years ago now, way back when I first started helping at the tent. We were sitting around, eating some greasy takeout from the chinese place in the shopping complex we were stationed in front of, when we saw him. 

  He came in skipping, he owned the place. His real name was fairly normal so my brother nicknamed him Tyrone. This kid was...interesting. First off he wasn't the best dressed. OK, I understand that not everyone can afford fitting clothes, his shirt was huge, his shorts were well...short, and his flip flops were a few sizes too small. Whatever, I don't judge.

  He was kind of dirty and looked like he needed a good hosing. This was forgivable, kids get dirty, and some don't have access to showers, I get it.

  *Then I saw the hat.*

  It was a flashy, hot pink. Add a layer of sparkly rhinestones. Then the centerpiece, a cutout of Miley Cyrus. This was Hannah Montana era cyrus. *Premium shit.* 

  The hat was ok. If he likes the queen of Disney, more power to him. But HE WAS SINGING SONG AFTER SONG AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS **HOLY SHIT** I mean maybe if his singing was good but no, it was painful. 

  So after watching him wander the tent for a few laps (yes, he went around at least 20 times) I noticed something. He was behaving oddly. Not shifty like he was going to steal something but....like a girl.

  He would do the usual ""Nyugh I'm soo hawt"" walk that girls sometimes do, the floppy hand, the rest all your weight on one leg/hip move, he missed not one nuance of the female behavior. I was astounded. To my narrow 13 year old mind, he was gay. The gay of the gays. Now I'm not so sure but then, I was convinced. 

  My brother and his friend were convinced too but they were so bored being in there constantly for 11 days that anything was cause for immediate judgement.

  So fast forward to checkout, he swaggers up to the table and makes his payment. He smacks his gum and pulls out a Miley Cyrus wallet. I know you shouldn't judge anyone but c'mon, I couldn't help but think ""what-what is he doing with...oh my""(-ley cyrus...heh)

  He then lingered for about an hour and pole danced on our tent supports. Yeah, I'm not really going to explain that one. He didn't do too much after that but he's been coming every year since then (about 3 or 4 years now) and he's lost the girl mannerisms and Miley swag, but he still compulsively lies about stuff.

  Antwon wasn't as crazy, he was just a short, portly little guy with a 70's porn stache that followed Tyrone around on his schwinn bicycle. He rides it to and from the tent every year and I see him all year around, and he's always on that bike. You'd think he would get skinnier, right? I mean he always is riding. Well, no. He just gets bigger. But it's ok, everyone loves Antwon.

  I actually do feel bad for Tyrone because he doesn't have a whole lot. I was actually inspired by him, he left me with a better understanding of the other side of life. I saw the way kids like him have to compromise, they have to use what they have to make ends meet, and they're happy doing it. He had access to a Miley Cyrus hat and sequin-encrusted wallet and damnit he was fabulous. 

  Wherever you are Tyrone, you've helped me see *the best of both worlds.*

BreakfastWithReddit,13,,18,1rcwf1,,12,"This is my first post here and as you can read my flair, I work fast food part-time and I've been working here for the past 4 months. While this story may not be about my boss or any customers, I just want to share with you how my coworker (we'll call here Sarah to protect her identity) has irritated me so much since I started working here.
So here I am, an 18 year-old male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month, I have to work the drive-thru by using the headset to take orders, making drinks, and making desserts, sometimes all at the same time. My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up. Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same time.

Meanwhile, Sarah is working the window, only transacting the money, credit cards, etc. and handing our customers their food. Quite obviously, I have a bigger job than her and as a human, I can make mistakes or be slow at times, but it's only to provide the same, excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset. For example, I might miss the chance to make the earlier customer's drinks while I am taking the previous customer's order. For a few seconds of making the drinks, delivering them, and apologizing for the wait, customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset (they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headset).

Now insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job. If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and they're waiting on me to make their drinks, I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset. While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customer's order. It can be hard at times for me because I really don't want to screw up the drink by letting the soda, tea, or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons, the liquid would spill out of the top. This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently, Sarah hates when I make mistakes like this.

She will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time, but I really want to tell her that maybe I don't want the drink to overflow or maybe that I don't want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I don't want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldn't hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me. It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask him/her again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed tone.

There were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer I'm taking an order from. When this happens, the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation. Sarah would have to ask for a manager's card to change the order at the window and then she would death-stare me as if I stepped on her iPhone. I really can't say what I feel against her because I'm working on the headset which is on 90% of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldn't want to say anything I could regret. It just makes me mad because I'm doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there, doing her window job and yelling at me when I can't finish a drink for a few seconds. She doesn't even help me finish my drinks, which would be nice, but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand, waiting for a cup to snatch. She always takes the cup right out of my hand (even when it's not done) so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her. It makes me so mad that she doesn't even lend a hand and she just stands there, being so ignorant of me while I work 3 jobs and her job only takes 15 seconds.

I'm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same, quality respect everyone else deserves. Before she started bitching at me, I tried to interact with her while we're on breaks, but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her. She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions, so I stopped, seeing that I can't break the wall that is her selfishness.

**This post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah, but here is the part that you've probably been waiting for (I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situation).**

It was 8:30 pm tonight and my shift was going to end at 9:00 pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken. I had to make a quick large-size Diet Dr. Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, wheat bun, and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich, which had me pressing a lot of buttons. At this point, it seemed that Sarah had enough of my ""dawdling"" and she finally decided to help me finish the drink, which was still fizzing at the top. I wanted to make sure the customer didn't get cheated for an under-filled large drink and I didn't want it to spill at the same time, but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr. Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker, she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform. She quickly looked away and went back to her post, acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage. I wanted to shout profanities, kick and scream at her, but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car, in complete shock of what happened. My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom. I was shaking in rage and the cold, wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up. My shift ended when I exited the restroom. I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home, still smelling of Dr. Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheel.

TL;DR Sarah, my coworker, has some kind of a bad grudge against me and I don't know why. After repeatedly telling me to hurry up with the drinks I was making, she finally decided to help me for the first time to finish a large Diet Dr. Pepper and she spilled the entire drink on me and she did not take responsibility for it.",My coworker is a terrible person,30,talesFromRetail

While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language? Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads. What are you nodding too? I asked for something, I didn't ask you to agree with me...

I've also been thinking about the random acts of yada yada stuff...

So, I want to ask: In my everyday interactions with the checkout people, what can I do to make their day a little brighter?

* What can I say that will make their day?
* How can I be friendly without seeming strange?

And, when doing this, 
* What if they're busy - how can I avoid just holding up the queue?
* How should I react when the salesperson seems to be just on autopilot?

In summary, I'll repeat again: what can I do to make their day a little brighter?

BefuddledBison,2,,4,1ric04,,23,"Howdy TFR. Turns out /u/BaffledBuffalo is taken on Gmail and Xbox Live so I changed my username to match my other accounts. At least my one post with it was sort of a one-hit wonder. 

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,3,1rigon,,20,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,3,1rie8h,,20,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,2,1riony,,14,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that‚ÄîI don't put up with that sort of BS‚Äîthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it‚Äîwith an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three ‚Äì Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before ‚Äì I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above ‚Äì watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring ‚Äì the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often ‚Äì the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition ‚Äì he was going to steal!  ‚ÄúOh shit here we go, ‚Äù I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies ‚Äì a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

‚ÄúNo way...is he really going to...‚Äù I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out ‚ÄúWoop woop woop woop!‚Äù loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

tankenka,5,,8,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

RetailQueen,8,,12,1reqkf,,0,"So tonight we had our annual holiday kick-off meeting and instead of getting me excited for holiday and all of the great things that come with it in retail, it made me want to come home and kill myself. 
Honestly, I LOVE working retail an I LOVE My job, but I honestly think this year my boss just hired the first people who came into the store and were looking for a job. I have never ever in my 6 years of working retail seen more incompetent employees in my whole life. 
First off, I'm the one in charge of training most of them, and by the way, I'm still pretty new at this job. I've only been there for about 5 months, but I guess because I'm able to catch on so quickly, and I have commen sense and know how to do things, I have to be punished by putting up with a million questions, and even more blank stares. 
Anyway, I thought I'd share some of the questions that were asked at tonight's meeting, an the responses I was giving silently in my head as I just sat there with my hea in my hands. So here you go. 
-""what we get for free though?""-first of all, learn how to speak proper English. Secondly, YOU are a seasonal employee, if you want something free, you have to earn it....shocking I know, considering by the way you're talking you've probably never had to do that for anything before. 
-""so, do we get here early or...""-hon, it's Black Friday, but no..I think you should continue the streak you have going on and show up 30 minutes late with some ridiculous excuse. P.S. I REALLY hope you don't come in after me , because if I have to wait for you to get here before I can leave my 9 hr shift I can't be responsible for what might happen to you. 
-""what do we do if a customer tells is that the price of something should be different than what it is?""-contrary to popular belief, the REGISTER is always right, not the customer. 
-""if we are supposed to work before we open, how do we get inside the store?""-I don't know, but you may want to try the door? Just a suggestion. Now that comment I actually did say out loud, and I cracked up after I said it, but just got a ton of blank stares..I guess no one else thinks I'm funny, and she proceeded to ask ""but what if the customers run us over when we open the door?"" -we work at a specialty clothing store. It's not like we are selling cheap TVs or anything anyone actually wants. No customers are going to act THAT crazy for a free tote bag. 

And that's basically the jist. I'm sure there were more things said, but I honestly don't want to remember any of it, for fear if my IQ dropping. I just don't understand why anywhere I work its like I'm the only one with any common sense. It happens every time. 

TL;DR: I swear my boss hired the most incompetent employees this holiday season, and tonight I saw all of their true colors in the form of ridiculous questions. ",Seasonal Employees,11,talesFromRetail
lvroye01,6,,15,1redbg,,0,"So, I go into my local National Chain grocery store, where everybody knows me, and knows I like my bourbon.

The house brand is decent enough, and cheap enough to buy regularly without feeling like I have to take out a loan.

It is well known to all, that I only buy the Small bottle, because, well... ""The big one gets me in trouble..."".

metamaxwell,386,,383,1r14xk,,1115,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

I don‚Äôt speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I walked up them smiling and said, ‚ÄúBastardo barato, get out.‚Äù

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

Not_A_CEO,180,,223,1rdpxf,,905,"Here's a relatively short tale today, folks.

I've posted here a few times before, and it should bear mentioning that I'm a bank teller and have been for 5+ years.  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a Teller.

I had gone through the mandatory 30-day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors, and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank.  I was technically under the 90 day Probationary stage, but for all intents and purposes I was a full-fledged employee.  Two weeks go by, and I'm steadily getting more and more comfortable.  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes, until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pants.

A customer walks in, hands me his $800 payroll check, and says he'd like to deposit it into his account.  *All right, no problem, here's your receipt, have a nice day.*  He leaves, and that's that.  Or so I thought.  About 10 minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says, ""Hey, Not_A_CEO, did you help this guy a few minutes ago?""

When I acknowledge that I did, in fact, help him with this deposit, my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guy's account and to tell him if I noticed anything ""off.""  So I did...and immediately noticed something wrong.  There's a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current day--I can see if he's been to the grocery store, a gas station, or if he's made any deposits.  Sitting in the Deposit section is...wait for it...a deposit made 10 minutes ago for the nice little sum of $100,000,000.  With my teller signature on it.

Read that sentence above again for me, would you?

**I deposited one hundred million dollars into this guy's account when it only should have been $800 dollars.**

Noticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket, and the words *Ohshitohshitohshit* start to fly about in my mind.  I'm currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me.  He affectionately calls me an idiot, and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount (which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that point).

Turns out, I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section, which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited.  Management thought it was hilarious, and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix, but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on me.

j_guazu,97,,176,1raji3,,652,"I work in customer service at our country's state-owned electricity company. Yesterday was one of days when the technicians go around disconnecting anyone who owes over three months of bills, and I had the joy of being one of the reconnections desks dealing with the hundreds of pissed off people that had been cut off. There were a lot of idiots among them, but one guy really stood out. He came up to my window, told me his power was shut off and that he couldn't find the bills to bring with him.

Me: No problem, do you have your meter number?

Him: No.

Me: Ok then, what's your address?

Him: Two blocks from the San Miguel church on route 2, the road with the petrol station.

Me: I need to know the name of the road and the house number.

Him: Well most people call it *random nickname related to the petrol station*.

Me: But what does the city call it?

Him: It's 'Sargeant something'.

Me: Yeah, I can't do anything unless I have the bill, the meter number or the address. Could you go and call someone at the house, have them tell you the meter number and then re-join the queue?

He wasn't pleased about having to queue all over again, but went off to call whoever. Eventually he works his way back down the line, reappears at my window and reads the number off his phone:

Him: It's 1754 and the last number is either 2 or 3.

Me: What?

Him: She says the wheel for the last number is turned halfway between 2 and 3.

Me: That's not the meter number. That's the number that tells you how much electricity you've used. The meter number is nine digits and it's on the grey sticker underneath where it says ""meter number"".

I got an evil-glare from him as he went off to find out the actual number and queue for a third time. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him on his final visit to the windows, but my colleague did. He managed to get the correct number and pay what he owed, but got angry when she told him his power would be back ""within 24 hours"". He snapped at her that he had eight chickens in the fridge that were all going to go bad if he wasn't reconnected immediately, and that he's going to write a formal complaint to the company about both of us and to demand some kind of recompense for the chickens. I really hope he does, I would fucking love to read that letter.","I can't psychically guess your address, and we're not paying for your chickens.",828,talesFromRetail
AAEmmerson,76,,100,1r7jes,,646,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about ¬£4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,566,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

diinomunster,71,,107,1rcku1,,391,"Hello my lovelies. I had a wonderful 4p-8a shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas station/C-Store. (I'm a softy who just can't say no). This offense happened around 2am. 

Now my gas station is in a really dumb place. We're in the main Highway of our city which is why we're a 24/7 store, but we're in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I don't see much traffic between midnight and four am. That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us. (Somewhere because there's a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart, a pizza Hut, a burger restaurant, a funeral home [yeah idk either], and then the bar is somewhere in that mess). 

So anyway between 130 &amp; 230 I get a nice hour of drunks. Our local police force is always really nice. They know that it's either me (5'3"" 115lbs female) or J (scrawny, but seriously awesome, little white guy) working alone. I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic. The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store. (I seriously give these guys so much free coffee). 

The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had, fresh out of the Academy. Super nice guy. Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss (we get them fresh every day so they aren't dried out if they were bagged) and thanked them when they said they'd be keeping an eye out for me. Around 150ish they had nabbed a drunk driver (yay team!) and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street. 

Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout (I'm on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit). The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store. When you walk in there's the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right, coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall. You have to walk around to your right, following the counters, to leave through the exit door. This is so you can't sneak out behind us and steal something. 

Queue 2am. I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy who's browsing our snack food quietly. In comes this super drunk middle aged black male. He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall (it's about 4.5 feet high). He will be Drunk Guy (DG). 

DG: Hey! How much for a cab to Menomininity? (I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us). 

Me: I'm not sure. We can call a cab and ask. Do you have a certain cab company you like to use? 

DG: just look some numbers up for me on the Internet. 

Me: I don't have the Internet here. I have a phone book though you can borrow. 

Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for. 

DG: NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK! 

Yeah... Okay? He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms. On his way he took out the fruit stand, the magazine rack, and the little employee break table in the hallway. 

Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom. ""That black guy grabbed me by the jacket, pulled me out of the stall, then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me."" 

Uhh.. What? 

The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit (despite me telling him he didn't have to because I have to throw it all away anyway) insists he'll stay until this guy leaves. 

Me: Yeah I don't have the time for this. I'm just calling the police. 

I get on the phone with none emergency, explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in. Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer. 

DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic.. And then he sees the officer. 

DG: AW THE FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCH!

the officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didn't fight. I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense. College kid dipped out at some point (I think he was underaged). A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as I'm talking to RideAlong for my statement. Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole. His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar. 

Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at 130 like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks can't hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster. They also haven't been letting the drunk patrons use their phone. For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone. Yeah. Screw them. 

DG got hauled off, I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up. The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation. I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders. 

I thankfully had last night and tonight off so I'll see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better. 

Well it's bed time. Sorry for the sleepy rambling. Good night TFR.

notanangel_25,44,,60,1rehs5,,387,"Hi TFR!  My first post as I've recently started at a big box electronics retailer for the holidays.  I'm no stranger to retail though as this will be my 3rd Black Friday, one year at a department store and the other at a toy store that went out of business.

Just a quick story about a customer from yesterday.  My department is right near the DVDs and we don't have any dedicated staff manning the DVD section so obviously if someone asks for help finding something whoever would just help them.  Anyway, a woman asks for help looking for a DVD.  We'll call her Clueless Woman (CW).

*CW:  Hi I'm looking for a DVD.*

*Me:  Sure what's the name of it?*

*CW: The Counselor.*

*Me: Let's go.  It sounds familiar, how long ago did it come out?*

We get to the DVD section and I begin looking for the movie.

*CW: Oh the end of last month.*

I stop looking and turn to her, 

*""You mean it's still in theaters?*

*CW: Yea, probably, so do you have it in stock?*

*Me: Um, typically movies are in theaters for a few months, maybe 3 months or so.  So the earliest you could possibly see a DVD for a movie that came out a month ago would be February or March.*

*CW:  Could you just check in the back?*

*I directed her over to a computer where I searched the item and showed her it didn't exist yet.  She proceeds to ask me about a TV show which is in it's first season on TV right now.*

*CW: So I also want the DVD for this show called Betrayal on ABC.*  

*Me: Sure.*  

Since I'm at the computer, I look to see if we have it.

*Me:  I'm sorry nothing's coming up. How many seasons does it have so far?*

*CW:  Um, I think 1.*

I end up googling it and find out it's currently on TV.

*Me:  Well the show is currently being aired on TV so there would be no DVDs available until the show is done.*  

*CW:  When will that be?*

*Me:  Well it depends if their season goes a full season or a half season.  Again you're talking the earliest March-ish and more likely the Summer or Fall.*

*CW:  Oh ok.  Can I watch it online?*

*Me: Sure you can watch it on ABC.com, or Hulu.com*

*CW:  But I don't have a computer.*

*Me: Well depending on your tv provider, you can maybe watch it free ondemand.  Or if you can access the internet through your TV or other device...*

*CW: How would I do that?*

*Me: Do you have wifi at home?*

*CW: So that means my TV can just connect?!*

*Me: Um, about how old is your TV?*

*CW:  I've had that old TV for years.  It might be as old as you, haha.*

Me:  Then no, you can't connect to the internet unless you have a another device like a gaming console or dvd player.*

*CW:  So... maybe I should just buy a tablet so I can watch it right?*

*Me:  Umm, that's an option...if that's what you want...*

*CW:  And I'll be able to watch the Counselor on there too right?*

*Me:* ****facepalm****  *Ma'am the movie is still in theaters, no DVD is going to come out until next year.  Even then it will take awhile before you'd be able to watch it online.*

*CW:  It's fine.  So tell me about the Nexus iPads.*

*Me:...*

I go through the whole spiel of showing her the different tablets and then she stops me mid-sentence and asks the price of the tablet I was telling her about even though it was right there in front of it.

*Me:  Well this tablet is actually on sale right now for $359.*

*CW:  What!?  That's too much money just to watch this movie.*  

Then she just walks out of the store.","""I'm sorry, what you're looking for doesn't exist yet""",447,talesFromRetail
calador,41,,87,1rdykp,,377,"In 2002, I worked for a national discount department store that had filed for bankruptcy. I was the Upfront Supervisor and worked the Customer Service desk. The company decided to close stores in waves. My store was in wave two. The closing did the usual ""Store Closing! X0% off! Everything Must Go!"" signs everywhere. In smaller print under this was the caveat ""All sales final. No exchanges or returns."" This was printed on the receipt and an employee stood at the door highlighting this line and repeating it verbally before thanking them for their business. 

We were about two months into the 3 month closing sale when this 30-something man who we will call DC comes in wearing nice clothes that obviously came from one of the high-end malls within a 20 minute drive of our store.

DC was carrying a box for an RC car. He drops it on the counter in front of me and asks for a refund. I apologize and tell him that I can't give him a refund as we were closing and all sales were final. I mentioned that the manufacturer's warranty was still valid and he could contact them for repair or replacement. He started getting upset. For five minutes or so, he proceeded to verbally harangue me and said that the reason our store was closing was ""poor customer service."" I tried in vain to calm him down as he got louder and more vulgar. Finally, I asked him to either quiet down or leave. He spoke right over me, telling me where to shove this broken RC car. I snapped. 

&gt;Me: Sir, I have repeatedly asked you to calm down. Unfortunately, all sales are final. We are closing. We have signs on all the support poles and every aisle in the store saying this. Your receipt says this. There is no excuse for you to come in here and harass me like this. Now, shut up or get the hell out of my store before I call security and the police to escort you in handcuffs for trespassing. 

&gt;DC: You can't talk to me like that! I am a Customer! The customer is always right! Where is your manager. I want to talk to them about this.

&gt;Me: Sir, I have waited 6 long years to say this to one of you pretentious pricks. Shut up! You are not always right. In this case, you are definitely wrong. I have told you several times that I can do NOTHING for you. Sure, I can get my manager here. They will tell you the same thing I have been trying to get past your perfectly styled thick hair. 

*I turn and point at the Hardlines Assistant Manager. She is biting her lips to keep from laughing out loud. I can hear the laughter in her voice as she tells her customer all sales are final and thanks for the business.*

&gt;In fact, she is standing right behind me at the register, ringing customers up and telling them exactly what I have been telling you. WE. ARE. CLOSING. So, what are they gonna do? FIRE ME?!? The store closes in a month. I and everyone here is losing their jobs already. Now. GET. THE. HELL. OUT. OF. MY. STORE!

*DC immitates a fish gasping for water for a moment before turning bright red.*

&gt;DC: You have not heard the last of this. I am calling your corporate office to complain.

*He leaves in a huff, forgetting his RC car. HLM, the manager I mentioned bursts into laughter. Through her teary hiccups, she turns and looks at me.*

&gt;HLM: How long has that been bottled up?

&gt;Me: 6 long years.

&gt;HLM: You hid it well. Glad you got it off your chest?

&gt;Me: Felt good.

At this point, DC comes back in, glares at me, and snatches his RC car off the counter. I merely smile and 
tell him to have a nice day and thanks for the business.

&gt;DC: F*** you, a******!

&gt;Me: Sorry, wouldn't want to dislodge that stick you have shoved up your backside. Bye!

Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

jessajuhanabi,30,,92,1rhnqp,,395,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

Tufty89,32,,59,1rdse5,,289,"*This is a story from long, long ago, that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit. I thought you all might enjoy it.*

This happened a while ago, but it just popped into my head, so I'm gonna do my best to remember it.

I used to work nights on the checkout of a 24 hour supermarket. Now, in this particular store, there were certain things that you couldn't do on the checkout without a manager's key and a code, generally, anything that would change the total by more than ¬£2, including voiding items, would require you to call a manager.

Since we worked nights, they gave the key and the code to 2 women who worked on the cigarette kiosk, because they had worked there for a long time, there was always at least one of them working and they didn't want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake. All worked fine normally.

Until the day that neither of these women were in. Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area? Did they buggery.

There were 3 of us working that night, and the other 2 were quite new on the department. We did our best, but I was the first to go down. A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided. I put a call out for the on duty manager, then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes. The line wasn't very long, because it was getting quite late. There was a little grumbling, but everyone seemed fairly understanding.

5 minutes pass. I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY. I advise everyone to start going through the other 2 tills. I am starting to get worried, but we still have 2 tills running, so it's not the end of the world. The lines get longer.

Then, one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice. It happens, the scanners sometimes just glitch. The item cost more than ¬£2, and bam, 2 checkouts are locked down. I direct people through the lone surviving till. The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done. I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly. No answer. I call again. Nothing. I put another call out over the speakers. Apologise to all customers.

Then it happens. The last till goes down. Another double scan. The line is 15 people deep. And this is at midnight, when it's odd to have more than 1 customer at a time. I try to call the manager again. Nada. I call a team leader, explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager, any manager. I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain what's going on. I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness. Some fo them have been waiting for 20 minutes. I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isn't anything I could do. I wish there was something, anything I could do. We can't open any other tills. They are all shut down, and even if I had the key to turn them on, all of our log in's are locked into these tills.

Finally, someone saunters to the tills. They aren't a manager. They had been sent down by the on duty manager, because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator. I'm getting frantic. I send her back to find the manager.

Time passes. People have been waiting for over half an hour now, and you can imagine what that looks like. Thankfully, none of the customers are directing their anger at us, but they are all very, very angry.

Eventually, the manager turns up. All good right? Nope.

He takes one look at the scene. And walks away. The customer's see my face. Now they know what the manager looks like.

There is more of the same. Frantic phone calls, announcements over the speakers. Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later, the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd. The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me, it seems my pleas for forgiveness worked

The manager is barely listening to the poor people. He keeps interrupting them, trying to push blame off of himself. This was the first he had heard of the situation. Luckily, all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him. The manager eventually rolls his eyes, and wanders off to the office to pick up the keys.

A full 45 minutes after the last till went down, we finally got the code and unlocked the tills. Did the manager apologise to the customers? Nope. Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait? Nope. Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that? Take a guess.

As I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them. It wasn't much, but I would accept any coupon they had, even if they weren't for our store. I would ""accidentally"" mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off. If something wouldn't scan, I'd just pretend I hadn't noticed and give it to them. I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble, but I just didn't care at this point. When we cleared the line, I sent the other 2 girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it. When they were gone and I was sure I was alone, I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering. ",Cashier's Nightmare,348,talesFromRetail
blackaurora,20,,57,1r5trc,,292,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

genericname11,28,,45,1r72se,,279,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I‚Äôd much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being ‚Äúbacking‚Äù). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That‚Äôs why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it‚Äôs a land yacht. It‚Äôs being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it‚Äôs a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she‚Äôs going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

‚ÄúHey, you!‚Äù She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don‚Äôt register that she‚Äôs talking to me.

‚ÄúHey, cart guy!‚Äù She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

‚ÄúDo you ned help unloading?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNo. I want to know why you dented my car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working on the other side of the lot. I haven‚Äôt been in this area for a while.‚Äù

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. ‚ÄúYou left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?‚Äù

Ugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.‚Äù

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

‚ÄúYou have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe says you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? I‚Äôm not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. Be careful. I don‚Äôt want this happening again.‚Äù

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.‚Äù

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it‚Äôs bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

‚ÄúYou just totaled a $60,000 car!‚Äù

Now, I did not handle this well.

‚ÄúYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.‚Äù

Second rule of retail: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù It should not be, but it is.

‚ÄúI want to talk to a manager right now!‚Äù

Yuppie-Husband parks his ‚Äútotaled‚Äù car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: ‚ÄúThis kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?‚Äù

Side note: ‚ÄúTotaled‚Äù is short for ‚Äútotal loss‚Äù This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

‚ÄúLets discuss it in my office.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was ‚Äúmy turn.‚Äù

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don‚Äôt have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband‚Äôs fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

themonkeyone,39,,52,1r7frc,,260,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

Legionofclowns,54,,69,1rcc3t,,255,"First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones I've been reading on here. It's long so be forewarned. 

So it's 2006 and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis. I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt, working in the DVD/CD/Video Games area and had become one of the goto guys. The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday; we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everything.....hopefully. The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo, for this was the year of the Wii. 

Now before this i had worked with the public. Had worked at the movie theater, fast food, etc. but this was my first real retail job. I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the news.

Day comes and of course I'm there at open. I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see? A line that stretches from the door, goes around the store, comes back to the front doors, and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store. I think ""no big deal we got this."" We start handing out the tickets, before opening, for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the 30 Wiis we managed to have. And within 5 minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didn't get what and the standard bickering. Not worried, we have a cop outside keeping order. 

So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working, customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown. NOPE! 

Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of ""THEY HAVE EM!"" and ""I HAD IT FIRST BITCH!""  Going into ""oh shit"" mode I briskly jog (flat out run) to the bay and witness about 20 soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway, pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way, and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way. I mean seriously, how many times do you get to see a middle-class housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter?  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees. 

At this point I have to make a decision....do I (A.) Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or (B. ) Stop a possible murder. I go with B. and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP. I get into the bay and WHOOMP, I'm out. Don't remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor. Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system. 

At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying. When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me, but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC-10 at anything not wearing a uniform. The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure I'm alright (SPOILER: I didn't die) More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name (I'm humorous most of the time so I said Garfield, that's how they knew I was ok). I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash (still have the scar) I'm good, in fact I'm ready to go back to work. 

Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras.  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away. I've never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my 7th (although I'm with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazon.com wasn't a competitor, damn restructuring).

tl;dr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that I'm Edward James Olmos on a jetski.

So anyway, I am new at my work, and I am a casual at a Jeweler. This was my first job so I put up with most stuff I didn't really like as I didn't want to cock it up. I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise. For about another month, Karen the Boss, would walk around quoting the bible, telling us in private how god is present when we work and how he is the one making us an income (I never saw him working once in the store) and how we wouldn't have jobs without him...Mostly the usual Bible-Thumper stuff. This was all until I finally blew up, in front of customers...She questioned me why I never wear a Cross or St Christopher medallion and how as it was ""part"" of the dress code, I could be fired for not wearing it. I turned to her and told her my ""view"" on everything she said, she started yelling, threatening to fire me I ended up resigning on the spot and I walked out. 

Skip ahead a month...Found out she had been ""Let Go"" due to workplace harassment that was tied in with her 'views' and she was reported for Harassing me and others by my colleagues.

LIVES_IN_CANADA,108,,72,1rbn62,,243,"So I used to work for a large department store in the front-end (cash and customer service mainly). At our location we had 24 cash registers, 10 of which were express (10 items or less) and the other 14 were regular belts. We also had 6 self-checkout machines that were watched over by 1 cashier at a time. This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them. 

Now I don't remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was, but I do remember that it was very busy. We had every single register open and we still had lines of 3-6 people at each register. 

When I'm watching the self-checkouts I'm watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the 48-pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned. I also have to help people out when they have coupons as 95% of the time the machine doesn't recognize them, as well as any and all questions about their purchases/prices/payment methods. So basically I'm busy running around the whole time.

So this day, while I'm watching the self-checkouts, two women who were next in the seemingly never-ending line come to one of the machines nearest to me. One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women (I found out it was the pregnant women's mother). Nothing note worthy happens with them until they're at their last item. It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart. The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness (I think she said cancer). 

Now they choose to come to a self-checkout machine. A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out. They didn't think to wait in one of the 24 other lines where you'd have a dedicated cashier who'd be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you. No, they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watch/help 6 customers simultaneously to lift and scan their item(s). 

So all that went through my head, but what came out of my mouth was ""Sure, no problem!"" and I started walking towards them (they were ~6 feet away from me). I take not more than 2 steps before the daughter says ""Oh it's alright mom, I've got this"" and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself. The mom notices that I didn't match Usain Bolt's world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me, ""What awful service you have, forcing a pregnant woman to lift &lt;item name&gt; by herself.""

I just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if they'd like more hands on service that going to one of the non-self-checkout registers would probably be better. The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on me:

""I guess some people's mothers just didn't raise them right.""

What!?! I don't know what she expected me to do, maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item? I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me, so I ignored her. It's been years since that's occurred and it's still the experience from retail that I remember best.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to.

dirteater6,12,,57,1rcbas,,240,"I work as a night manager at a grocery store.  I work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., and am the highest authority in the store at night because everyone in upper management goes home.

Most of the clerks and cashiers are high school students, and I am not much older than them.  They tend to think that I'm one of them, so they don't have to listen to what I say even though I am always polite and charming when I ask them to perform specific tasks.  

Three of these kids are the embodiment of Satan himself.  They never work hard (partly because they were never respected by other managers), they swear in front of customers, throw shit across aisles, sexually harass the female workers, etc.  I absolutely dreaded the nights I worked with them because I knew nothing would get done and I would be promptly yelled at the next day because of this.

Anyway, about a week ago they were all caught by the bookkeeper for some pretty bad stuff.  They would steal VISA gift cards, use manager numbers to override the difference on the register so it balanced, and they also stole booze, pizza, and many other things.  This supposedly went on for a couple months, and the three of them had their own little operation.  They ended up stealing $48,000 worth of gift cards.

groundciv,28,,49,1r4jqn,,233,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

If you've read my previous posts on here, I try to show how much fun I have with the people I worked with as we have plenty of horror stories on this sub-reddit. I've worked with a fantastic group of people,  Black Friday was no different. 

I woke up at 2am, getting ready to start my twelve hour split shift. I was to work from 3am to 11am then come back and work 6pm to closing. A pretty long day to say the least. I grabbed a couple of five hour energies, and jumped into my gaming department. Today was some of the holiday paid workers' first day, so they were mainly there to direct people around the store. This is the story of one of those fellas. We'll call him G. 

I began talking with my group, showing them what we wanted to sell, reminding them of the deals to promote etc. While I did this, the group of people came in. 

The way we did it, was we had a route for all customers to follow no matter what. People were to follow this route until they got to the department of their choosing. They were to grab what they wanted, then move back into the line as the route ended at the registers. It was a very organized system to say the least. While the people were being herded through the lines, I began to hear screaming. 

This wasn't a AHHHH I'M IN TROUBLE kind of screaming this was a YEAHH WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!!! kind of screaming. My customers as if they were queued by a director all looked towards the isle, as did I. It was G. He was standing there holding the festive balloons cheering on our customers. 

**G:** OH you got THAT AWESOME LOW PRICED WII?? CONGRATS MAN WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!

You have to realize, this is a high ceiling open area store, and everybody in the store can hear him. 

**G:** BBBBLLLLACCCCKKKK OOOOPPSSS!!!! WOOOO HOOO!!! YOU GOT IT BRO! All I gotta say man is ZOMBIES!!! KILL THE ZOMBIES MAN!!!! 

I began to realize he was cheering our customers on, and just having a good old time. As he did this, other holiday people who also just started on Black Friday began to shout and cheer the customers on. I guess they thought this guy who started it all was somebody who had worked there for a while, and they thought it was normal. 

Basically, I thought it to be fantastic. I had one of the radios on me, and knowing that none of the new guys had radios, I began to talk about it. 

**Me:** You guys hear that? 

**Manager:** You mean the likely sound of epic tickling?

**Me:** Your neighbors must complain a lot if your wife sounds like a male screaming when you tickle her. 

**Manager:** Yeah you'd be surprised. Tell the new guys to put a cork in it. 

**Me:** Well, the customers kind of like it. 

**Manager:** They like being tickled eh? 

**Me:** ...

**Me:** Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.

**Manager:** Well who am I to stop them then?

**Me:** Yeah seriously, you're not God. 

It got to the point where most of the new people (and some of the regular employees) began to do this, all because of G. 

I don't work there anymore, but recently I visited the store to see some old friends. G is still there, and he's a supervisor now. I think the man deserves it, as long as he doesn't tickle our customers.

arsci991,56,,35,1ren2b,,217,"All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories, one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe. It's kind of a long one, but hopefully you all enjoy it!

A little background: I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items, including gun safes. This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year. We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see, with the largest (at the time) being an Canon Armory 80-gun safe. This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock. Our store only ever had 2 of them, they never had an official SKU#(we had to ring them under the generic ""merchandise"" SKU), we had them for over a year, and after we sold out we never saw them again. Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer, but they all ship with the same combination: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes, or by just guessing. It was no secret, and we encourage people to take a good look.

It was the evening, and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day. Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down. I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by, and he looked PISSED. And not just ""end of black friday"" pissed but ""someone done fucked up"" pissed, so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe. Literally ear to the door, asking if it was doing alright. Maybe not to the safe, but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe. Uh Oh. Things start running through my head...why didn't he just unlock it? HOW did a person get locked in it? Then he pulls me aside.

Assistant Manager: ""We have a situation.""

Me: ""A situation?""

AM: ""Yes, a kid just locked his brother in the 80-gun.""

Me: ""Soo why don't we unlock it?""

AM: ""It won't unlock. I think the battery died, but I replaced it and it's still not working.""

Me: ""How did he end up locked in it?""

AM: ""His brother apparently. He's over hiding in the feed racks last I saw. Not sure where the parents are, they haven't made an appearance yet.""

I went over and tried it myself, and sure as crap...it's locked. And this kid is FREAKING out, for obvious reasons. We tried a couple other batteries with no luck, and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other 80-gun, with no luck. The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs. 

We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little, and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup. Assistant Manager called the police, while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safe.

After about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out, we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a 5 minute lockout on the keypad...if the battery dies or is removed, you can't touch it for 5 minutes after putting the battery back in. So after 5 long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions, the safe OPENED. And this 15 year old kid, I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe, straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears. 

The police and fire department left pretty quick after that, but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us. Complaining about precautions, safety, how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently. Eventually we stopped her,

AM: ""Ma'am, your kid walked up to the safe, entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe. Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did, the battery died. At this point the brother closed and locked the door. And it's our fault for not taking enough precautions?""

Eventually the woman and her kids left. No policies changed, except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do. Gives us all a good chuckle. Every couple months she calls, and identifies her self as ""the person whose kid got locked in the safe."" Usually she's prying to know if we've changed our policies (we haven't) then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of (which she doesn't get). Oddly enough, its been another year and we've had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes!

I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,46,1rh8hc,,201,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

prickelypear,23,,27,1rf2t9,,187,"I've lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can remember.

I used to work in a big name retail store in a college town, we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously, and they were generally pretty laid back customers. But of course we got older customers as well.

One night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line. It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come. One of items was a basket, it looked like wicker but I don't remember what it was exactly. Either way when I rang it up it came up full price, ~$30-$40, and the woman stopped me.

**Woman:** That's supposed to be on sale, why is it ringing up full price?

**Me:** I'm not sure, I'll get one of the girls from that department to come up and she'll know what's going on.

While I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle (which this store doesn't have, we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much) and how this is so aggravating. Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the ""Clearance aisle"" and it's ringing up full price and she knows it wasn't placed there by another customer because there were many of them there. The girl from hard lines informs the woman we don't have a Clearance Aisle, but she knows where the baskets are and she will go look.

While we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up. Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others. The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale, the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one, it's full price and walks off. 

**Woman:** (to me) Well he needs the basket for his clothes.

**Me:** Okay (and I start to place it in the bagging area)

**Woman:** No! I'm not paying that price for it. I want it for the Clearance price! You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price. 

I don't remember what she was saying the ""Clearance price"" was, but it was far below the actual price. Usually if its less than $5-$6 we were told just give it to them, and even sometimes if it's $10 on something worth at least $35. But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be $15.

**Me:** Ma'am we don't have a Clearance aisle, the basket is full price and I don't have a way to lower it in my system.

**Woman:** That's bullshit, if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you *can* adjust the price!

**Me:** This store *doesn't have* a Clearance Aisle. We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isn't one of them.

**Woman:** No. That basket was on the Clearance Aisle. Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale. That one is too. I'm getting that basket but I am *not* buying ~$30-$40 for it. Where are the managers? This is bullshit I'm not dealing with you anymore.

So, with the woman's son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes, I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up. I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time; manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer, customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things, manager gives them what they want, and customer leaves smug. Not this manager, she always was my favorite. She gets to my till, listens to the, of course now calm and smiling woman, explain why she wanted the manager. 

**Woman:** So see? the basket was on the Clearance Aisle, but it rings up full price. If it's not on Clearance then it shouldn't have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there, and I need it, I expect to get it for the Clearance price.

**Manager:** (Smiling at her) We don't have a Clearance Aisle. That basket is in the home section with the other baskets. We have baskets on sale in that aisle, they have tags marking them. But this one isn't on sale. If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get one.

**Woman:** (smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes) NO! I will **NOT** go pick out another basket because of your mistakes!!! *I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance price!*

**Manager:** (still calm and smiling) Well, seeing as we still don't have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price. We aren't lowering it. If you want the basket it's ~$30-$40. Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase, you can pay for your other items and leave.

**Woman:** (screaming at this point) I'm never coming back here again, but I'm not done with this yet! This is ridiculous! I'm writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers! I will make sure you both lose your jobs! You can keep this shit, I'm not buying **ANY** of it!!

And with that she stormed off and out the door, leaving her son to mutter ""I'm so sorry..."" and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day. Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman. Nothing was going to happen. And nothing did. So much for not being done with it yet, we didn't hear a thing about about her after that. Her son did frequent the store though.

I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

Bunbury42,45,,39,1raduq,,176,"I work at a specialty retail store that sells a wide variety of one very specific item. We were running a coupon that offered people to buy 2 and get 2 free. A woman comes up to the register and presents her shopping basket, which contains 4 of the item and a few other things. First issue is that she has mixed in things that aren't part of the coupon. Technically I'm not supposed to allow that, but she was actually buying a worse deal than she could otherwise get. 

Me: ""Ma'am, the sizes you're getting aren't part of the coupon. I'm happy to adjust it for you, but it's actually a better deal to switch to [insert item info here]"" 

Woman: ""That's fine. I prefer these."" 

 Me: ""No problem at all"". 

It's strange to not want more for the exact same money, but if she's happy, that's fine. I get to the end of the transaction and inform her of her price. It's something around like $122.30. She hands me another coupon offering $15 off a purchase of $45 or more. Two red flags. First, we can't stack two kinds of coupons together. We can stack the same coupon in some circumstances, but different types we usually can't. Second, the coupon she gave me expired over a month ago. 

Me: ""Ma'am, I unfortunately can't take this coupon. It expired over a month ago."" 

Her: ""Yes you can. Just manually override it."" 

She's correct. Technically I could just drop her price. I shouldn't, but could. 

Me: ""I'm sorry, but corporate policy prevents me from doing that."" 

Her: ""Fine. Just forget it. I don't appreciate it and I won't be back."" 

Me: ""I apologize. If you're unhappy, [Company name here] is always happy to hear comments and suggestions."" 

Her: ""I won't be back."" 

Me: ""OK."" 

And she left. I told my manager about it, who was in the back handling a new shipment at the time.

insecure_shit_knob,30,,42,1r2plz,,178,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

TennisAndBeer,4,,37,1r63y6,,168,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues.

meguriau,19,,26,1r5sy8,,170,"Hi TFR, I‚Äôm back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It‚Äôs been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn‚Äôt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That‚Äôs preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs the most I can do for you at this point in time. We‚Äôll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN‚ÄôT DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I‚Äôm terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you‚Äôd left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN‚ÄôT CALL. 

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry to hear of your husband‚Äôs ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let‚Äôs just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don‚Äôt need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that‚Äôs retail!

xVarekai,86,,35,1r3e2x,,162,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

wigglemaster,46,,23,1r3cg6,,160,"So I have been reading this subreddit for a while and all of your retail horror stories help make my day manageable. Sorry if there are any formatting errors, but I am on my phone and it is my first post. 

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.

spotty82,18,,28,1r43bb,,147,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

Foliagus,31,,31,1r761t,,145,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.

MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,,19,1rep4z,,145,"A little backstory: I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school. I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes, however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy people...to be quite honest, I really enjoyed my time at this store...All my managers were great, it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool. I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked with...I guess it was kind of a utopian retail job.  

Now, a little more background about my particular job responsibilities...I was the stock room manager, I was the person that met the truck at the back door at 5am every tuesday, thursday, and saturday.  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipment....I knew how many boxes were coming, I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment.  In a nutshell, I knew the stock room backwards and forwards, knew what we had back there and what we didn't have because I unpacked it, organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers. There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor, and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they needed.

This particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times.  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me.  A little about our return policy...With a receipt and tags on the clothes, there was no time frame for returns.  You can buy something, put it in a closet for ten years, decide you don't want it and bring it back.  No problem.  If you don't have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes, you can always return them....things stay in the system basically indefinitely...but if you don't have the receipt, we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get.  If it says 50 bucks on the tag but comes up .25 cents, you get .25 cents back.  who knows what reduction stickers you've peeled off the tag.  So all this being said, here is my actual story...and I only remember this because in almost a year, this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this job.

Nice lady (NL) comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counter.

NL: Hi, MrDoctorSmartyPants!  How are you?  I haven't seen you the last few times I've been in here!

Me:  It has been a while, I'm doing pretty good...do you want to return these pants?  Do you have your receipt?

NL: I sure don't, but I've never taken the tags off of these as you can see, so I can still return them right?

Me: Yep you sure can, but, unfortunately if you don't have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as, and I'm sure you bought these a while back because I've never seen these in this store. (It should be noted the tag said $65 bucks for these particular pants)

NL:  Ok, that is fine, I've dealt with that before...but the tag says $65 dollars, and just because I don't have my receipt doesn't mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchase.

Me: I know you come here all the time, but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants, we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never there...and to be honest with you, in the time that I've worked here (since the store opened) I have never seen these pants, did you purchase them at another location?

NL:  Yes, but that doesn't matter because I paid $65 for them like a year and a half ago, and I've never worn them...but lets just return them and see what I can get back for them.

Me: ok, lets see...(at this point I scan the item and it comes up, no shit, at $2.45) Ok, it says $2.45.

NL: WHAT? That's robbery! That CAN'T be right.

Me: I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you, I explained our policy and you said you understood.  I've returned things without a receipt for you before....if I could give you more, I would...but I can't and I don't have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads.  

NL: Well this is absolutely unacceptable.  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost me....I know the policy but this is a little different...i paid a lot for these pants...this should be an exception!  I want to see a manager!

Me: Ma'am, I am the stock manager, I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants before...I'm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you, but I can't.  Honestly, this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy exists.

NL: Can't you just go look to make sure?  

Me: Sure, I'll do that for you.  (at this point i go in the back and out the back door for 10 minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back)  Nope.  We don't have any.  what the computer shows is the best I can do.

NL: NO! I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER! LESLIE! WHERE IS SHE?

Me: She isn't here today, ma'am...I'm the only manager in the store.

NL:  Well call her!

Me: I don't have her home number and I'm not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue.  I'm not making you return the pants, I'm not forcing you to take this money....you can keep the pants.

NL:  This is so stupid...I can't believe you're treating me like this! I come in here all the time! You should make exceptions!  Just give me my money and I'll be on my way...I don't want these stupid pants.

Me: Ok, Ma'am...here you go $2.45.  I'm really sorry for your inconvenience, have a nice day.

NL:  Yeah, you ruined this nice day! Wait until I talk to your manager!

I actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about something....the lady walked up and said hello, was cordial, and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior.  Sorry if this is so long, it wasn't even that bad...it just stuck out in my mind.

TL;DR: Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance, thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine.","Woman understands store return policy, refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance.",164,talesFromRetail
prettehkitteh,24,,30,1rcsdq,,140,"Wall of Text coming! 'tis the season, and I'm feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they don't need. I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier, so I never really experienced Black Friday - except one year, when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side. I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning. For some reason, the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at 5am. I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout, and we had special areas where the really popular/discounted toys were set up the day before, so I pretty much had no idea where anything was.

We didn't get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon, but people were lined up, and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early. I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside. I was immediately flooded with shouted questions:

""WHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOS?!""
""WHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SON!!""
""I NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTION?!""

I did my best to stutter answers out as people didn't even stop moving for me to answer. I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos (TMEs from now on) were because everyone wanted one. I could not believe how many people wanted one. I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive, and after the initial rush for the first two hours, people started being a little more polite, though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on. That was when crazy beard came in.

CB was a grungy ex-confederate-looking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face. He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded, ""I need a TME."" 

Me: ""Of course sir, if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right, they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle, you can't miss them.""

CB: ""Are you sure there are any left?""

Me: ""I haven't been back there in a little while, so unfortunately I don't know, I'm sorry.""

He waved a hand at me and scurried off. I thought that was the end of it. A minute later, he scurried back, visibly a lot more agitated.

CB: ""There were no TMEs!""

Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we did have some this mor--""

CB: ""How could you not have any TMEs?! You must have more in the back, I need one!""

I knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before - there was no backstock. I tried to explain this to CB as he started shaking.

CB: ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEs!""

Me: (fishing for anything to get this guy off my back) ""I-I'm sorry sir, there's not much I can do. If you had gotten here earlier--"" (big mistake)

CB: ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN I GET HERE, YOU'RE A FUCKING TOY STORE, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES?! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER!""

Those magic words. I was shaking now (I don't handle anger very well) and was relieved to get some help. I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom. CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his world-ending problem, but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder. We waited. I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers, so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CB.

Five minutes passed. I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom, trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers. CB wasn't amused, so I just kept standing there, shuffling my feet. I couldn't leave the guy, so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing. Another five minutes passed.

CB: ""What the fuck is taking him so long?""

Me: ""I don't know, I'm so sorry, I can go look for a manager if you want.""

CB: ""You're staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up, I know a cop out when I hear one.""

Me: ""I'm not trying to abandon you sir, I want to help--""

CB: ""You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HEAR ME?""

I was on the verge of crying at this point. I picked up the phone for a third time, trembling, trying to take a breath so I didn't start crying over the intercom - when the lead manager Tim finally showed up, out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly. CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim, who was 6'3"", built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long, braided black beard. Tim, who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees, asked ME what the problem was, which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitless.

Me: ""We're out of TMEs, and he really would like one.""

CB: ""That's RIGHT. I have a problem with the fact that--""

Tim: ""Just a moment, sir. Prettehkitteh, thank you, you can go back to the front.""

I scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didn't have TMEs, we didn't have TMEs. I watched as CB's anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little, to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tim's best gentle giant voice. Within two minutes, Tim smiled and pointed out the door. CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out. 

Tim came over to me, gave me a big hug, and told me to go take a breather in the back room. The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively, and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand.

When I was working big box ish books and more, I would get folks demanding we 'override' coupons all the time. And I was the manager. Old coupons, coupons they were clearly trying to double up etc. Thing was we had no override. It was all off bar codes and your reward card. Once something was 'past its sell by' forget it.

I had one day where we had this 'bounce back' redeeming. It was right after holidays and it was a 50% off the REGULAR price of one hardcover book. Art books excluded (being near a high end area we had some crazy expensive titles we basically sold at cost). 

All day folks are trying to stack it on NYT titles, use it on movies so on and so on. I'm down to my last hour and I'm just tired of it. I've already kicked out four folks for calling lawsuit (price company policy we stop all transactions at that point), with four 'I'm going to get you fired' rants. We have to document in detail all customer issues so I had paperwork on all four of them and the other yelling customers. Thankfully for every yelling customer there were several that just shrugged it off as their failure to read.

So I'm in the back, not actually the floor manager that hour, helping the stock room guys pull up their sold today lists to see what needs to go on the restock carts. A call comes back that our FM is with a customer and there's a guy yelling he wants the manager. Sure I'll come out. 

Guy wants to use the coupon on an art book. He's been told no, they are excluded. He's yelling that the cashier can and will take it etc. I cut in and introduce myself as the manager. He goes through his rant again. I explain that it's all programmed into our software and no we can't. He gives that manual override line. With some swear words tossed in. And some 'if that stupid cashier' comments

I'm done. I really want to hulk out on the guy. But I don't. I'm not sure how I kept my cool but I did. The rest of the convo goes something like: 

Me: so vacation or do you have a home here too

Him: excuse me?

Me: I said are you on vacation or do you keep a home here as well as (city our home office is in)

Him: I live here, why the bleeping bleep would I live there

Me: because the only way you can say what our system can and can't do is if you helped right it and those staff all work at the home office. 

Me (rubbing it in) and as a member of the home office you are fully aware that all employee purchases must be rung up by a manager and employees are not allowed to avail themselves of a reward card or the coupons issued in that program. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to report these violations and your harassment of my staff to HR. 

Me: (still rolling with it) if you would like to purchase this book I will ring you up for the employee discount of 10% for art department titles. What was your employee number? 

At which point he walked out without saying a word. And no I didn't think he was an employee I just said it to shut him up and make him hopefully see what a fool he was acting by telling us how our stuff runs. 

Never saw him again, never heard anything about him calling and complaining. Although our camera system has audio and our home office can and does remotely capture all footage to keep us honest. My district manager apparently saw that particular moment and was quite amused. 

TLDR: random customer tries to school us on our point of sale systems, I demanded his employee number to properly ring him up. ",What's your employee number again?,183,talesFromRetail

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16. ¬†Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure. ¬†He wants desperately to be cool. He‚Äôs got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid ‚Ä¶

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid‚Äôs church bow tie and his wife‚Äôs apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I‚Äôm bagging groceries. It‚Äôs Labor Day, so I‚Äôm constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

‚ÄúHey, are you unmined?‚Äù

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She‚Äôs my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and ‚Äúyeah‚Äù is all I can manage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I‚Äôve known since elementary school.
‚ÄúYou working all day today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBummer. We‚Äôre having a pool party. You could have come.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I‚Äôm here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I‚Äôm totally scared of talking to girls.

‚ÄúI wish I could. I hope you‚Äôre having a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe we can do something next week.‚Äù Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

‚ÄúTotally. You have a pen?‚Äù

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I‚Äôm both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy‚Äôs Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

‚ÄúCall me. We‚Äôll set something up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, thanks!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you later!‚Äù She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it‚Äôs all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I‚Äôm feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I‚Äôm so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom‚Äôs stash (don‚Äôt do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she‚Äôs just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bummed. This went by took quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has,‚Äù I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR ‚Ä¶ next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I‚Äôd give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it‚Äôs indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I‚Äôll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","‚ÄùBag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2‚Äù or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",198,talesFromRetail
littlewoolie,8,,29,1r6hc9,,131,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,160,talesFromRetail
aturquoiseseashell,12,,24,1rg9do,,128,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch‚Ä¶""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am‚Ä¶"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

At this store,  there are TONS of tiny little items (earrings, bracelets ect.)

You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever. This pair of kids walk in, one looks 15, the other maybe 11, and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone. Well, manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM. I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security. Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream!!  He stops her, calls her mom, who comes in SCREAMING at her (in perfect english) and makes her spit out those earrings. We only got 3 out of 4 back. She can keep the last one.

AAEmmerson,23,,21,1ra3qv,,113,"You all seemed to really like my [Bacon sandwich](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r7jes/thrown_out_of_the_airport_all_for_a_bacon_sandwich/) post so much. I thought I'd tell another story from the airport coffee shop.

This one is more asshole manager than customer.

In our little unit there was very few places to actually store things, so most of our stuff was stored in the bowels of the airport. To get it up into the behind security bit of the airport was a real pain.

We had store guys who'd pack a cage of goods, like the big tall ones you'd see in a supermarket, but then we had to take them into a separate room, with airport security, and unpack all the boxes onto a big scanner, and then repack the cage. Often single handedly running back and forth to either end.

It's a royal pain in the butt, and even worse that 99% of the security guards shrugged and said not my job if something was about to fall off or break. I don't blame them, was just a pain. 

Well one day to do this job, when I start unpacking the cage I notice that there's a puddle of milk underneath. (For the record our milk came in boxes, with a huge plastic bladder inside), so obviously it was leaking, which in itself was not hugely unusual, you'd just grab the mop in there and clean it up. 

So I put them on the belt and send them through, when finally they get to the other side I lift them off, as  i do so, the bottom of the boxes opens, and about 40litres of milk gushes out, all over me, and the floor. I get absolutely soaked. 

I have to keep packing the trolley though, because some of the stuff is frozen and you have to do it in quick time. Except the second box of milk does pretty much the same again, as soon as it touches the cage, it explodes over the floor. 

At this point, i'd been working since 4am, it was 1 pm, i'd had no breakfast, a non stop morning, and was tired and emotional and somewhat covered in 80 litres of milk,

Under threat of death from security, I was told I had to clear it all up, because yeah milk smells. So I traipsed the cage upstairs and to my manager (a different supervisor to Bacon sandwich man) who's just finishing off his break (after an hour working).

I ask him for an extra pair of hands to get the whole thing cleared up because quite frankly it was going to take me for ever. He stands up, and laughs in my face, and walks off shouting ""get a mop bucket and do it yourself"" - It really did take all my powers of self control not to rugby tackle him and punch his head in, but I'm honestly close to rage tears with being so tired drenched. 

I gather my thoughts and go do the job, as unpleasant and as long as it took me, when I get back, and ask for my meal voucher for my break, he tells me I used it all up cleaning up the milk, It's only when I stand up face to face with him (i'm at least 6'3 to his 5'7) and remind him of my legal rights to a break that he backs down.

Needless to say I refused to ever work with him again, and he quickly got transferred to another shop in the airport. That was the worst day of my retail life I think. ",Why I nearly cried over spilled milk,134,talesFromRetail
rumplesplitskin,25,,15,1re4w8,,114,"We had a power cut at the station the other night, thankfully the only customers in the shop were just in buying a few grocery items. Nobody was on the forecourt getting fuel at the time. The only power we had was the emergency battery back up that powers the lights, nothing else no tills, pumps or computer. Even the main door had to be physically pulled open to let people out, it was obvious to anyone with a IQ over that of a cabbage that we were not open for business.

Those customers that were in at the time understood that because of the outage we could not process and credit/debit cards and worse still we could not open the tills to give change. It was a pain in the arse but we managed to give change by breaking in to the staff tea kitty so we got by without having to refuse any sales.

Then the last in the line a 18ish old guy decided that he needed petrol. This following is how that conversation went..

ME : Ok, your total comes to ¬£2.56. Due to the power cut we can't open the tills so if you have close to the correct amount in cash that would be a help.

PP(petrol pr*ck) I only have some pound coins is that ok ?

ME : Yeah, that's fine. We'll just call the total ¬£2.50 and i hand him a 50p coin back.

PP : Thanks, i'll hand in the 6p next time ok ?

ME : Naw, that's ok. Don't worry about it.

PP : Thanks, bye.

Just as my cashier is pulling the door open for him he stops and turns back to me.

PP : Oh i think i better get some petrol for the morning.

ME : Sorry, but we have no way to sell you fuel. Everything including the tills is out so i can't take payments.

In hindsight i should have worded this differently but it was late and i was just wanted him out of the shop so we could close early and get on with documenting tonight's outage for the next shift in the morning.

PP : Then i'll just leave you the cash and you can ring it up when the power comes back on.

ME : Sorry but i can't do that.

PP : (cuts me off) But i NEED petrol, you'll just have to figure something out.

He then storms out to the pumps where he's parked and lifts the nozzle expecting the petrol to flow. I'm looking at my cashier asking him did that really just happen ? After a good ten seconds or so with the guy waiting out there he waves his arms to get my attention and shouts at me to ""turn the fucking pump on!""

I grab the padlocks that we use to lock the pumps overnight with and head out to let this idiot know that he's not getting petrol from us tonight. As i'm walking over to him he's still standing there with the nozzle in his car looking at me like i'm the idiot.

ME : We have a power cut. We have no power to turn the pumps on.

PP : Don't lie to me, your lights are on. you have power, you just want to get home don't you ?

ME : Yes i do want to get home but i still can't give you any petrol without electricity to power the pumps. Those are emergency battery lights.

PP : I NEED petrol, what are you going to do ? i'm not leaving until i get my petrol.

ME : (really pissed off now) Well what i'm going to do i lock these pumps, close the shutters and then go home.

PP : WHAT ? You can't talk to me like that i'm a customer.

ME : No, you're a f**king idiot. now leave before i call the police to have you removed.

Normally i would never talk this way to any of our customers but this guy's attitude and pure dumbness just hit a nerve with me.

PP : Fuck you, you fat munt.

ME : Yeah ok, just leave.

PP : I want to talk to your manager, you're getting fired!

ME : I am the manager and i'm telling you to leave the premises before i call the police.

He drops the nozzle on the ground and looks at me as if to say pick that up bitch!

ME : Really ? What are you a child in a man's body ? Grow up.

PP : F**k you.

He gets into his car and drives off but not before leaving a parting shot of calling me a fat cow. Ok, i was a little taken back by this as i'm a 6.2"" hairy arsed dude with three day old stubble but still a cow ? that really hurt :)

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

SuzyGreenburg,10,,12,1re89p,,109,"When I was bar tending one evening a guy that I knew by name only came in.  He stumbled up to the bar and ordered his drink, a martini of some kind I think.  As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it, he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldn't figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me.  I ignored him and finished the drink.  As I handed it back, he looked at it, told me anybody could make a martini, and slapped 36 cent on the counter.  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached, turned back around and said ""I think I tipped you to fn much.  I can make my own gd martini next time.  Enjoy your minimum wage.""  Okay.  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing I'd said the entire time was ""What would you like to drink?""  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness, but I brushed it off; just another night at the bar right?

Fast forward an hour or so and I go down to meet my husband at another bar on the property that stays open after the hotel bar closes.  Who should be there, but the jerk from before.  When he spots my husband he comes directly over and starts chatting him up because they'd known each other as kids and were friendly.  When my husband introduced me to this guy, it was like I was talking to a completely different person.  He was all compliments and can I by you a drink and it's so nice to meet you lets get a table together.  

Clearly this guy did not recognize me from before.  I stood there looking at his stupid face trying to remain calm, but the more I thought about it, the angrier I became.  When I'm in service mode I'm worthy of ridicule and rudeness, but as my husband's wife I'm someone he wants to be friends with?  I decided I couldn't let it pass.  By the end of my tirade my husband was holding me back, jerk off had spilled his drink on himself and was profusely apologizing while trying to blend into the wall.  He left shortly thereafter and called my husband the next day to apologize sober.

talesfromesalesthrow,16,,30,1r6n0m,,100,"Apologies for the length. I just needed this out of my system. Since I've only experienced support on this sub, I need to get this out there. 

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Queue Asshole-Negger. Let's call him A.N. for short. 
A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking."" 



Label that with a big NOPE.JPG and send it off to the printers!

Mystic-Spiral,23,,29,1rb12d,,96,"This is a story of a horrible client, a weak manager, and a poor associate (me) caught amidst it all. 

It was a dark night in late spring. The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms. I love my job and my customers at this store (this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location) are generally exceptionally awesome. Even the ‚Äúbad ones‚Äù aren‚Äôt really THAT bad and only minor annoyances. Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD (manager on duty) and I were cleaning up around the store. Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being.   

For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine; I know, somehow, that this is going to be bad. 

DB: ‚ÄúI bought this dress the other day (whips out cotton dress) and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back. Can I exchange it?‚Äù

Me: (Hoping this is easier than I first thought) ‚ÄúOf course, let‚Äôs see if we still have another in the same size!‚Äù(Extra small petite)

We did not. 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry; it doesn‚Äôt look like we have another in the same color and size. We can exchange it for a different color, or I can refund you back your money for it, no problem!‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo, I want to wear THIS one!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI can look it up and see if another store has it if you want. We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there. We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer, but if there is a low inventory, there‚Äôs no guarantee you will get t unfortunately. The inventory is about 24 hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shown.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo. That is unacceptable. I want this one! Can‚Äôt you just sew a new button on it?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt have spare buttons, but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesn‚Äôt look off balance if you like.‚Äù (Mind you the button is TINY. About half the size of a dime. It‚Äôs really not that big of an issue.)

Now, this where things start to go downhill. 

DB: ‚ÄúWhat will you do with the dress if I return it?‚Äù  
Honesty, to me,  is the best policy, but had I known how this was going to go down, I probably would have just lied to this person.

Me: ‚ÄúMost likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped out.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúThen rip a button off another dress and sew it to this one!‚Äù

I am VERY taken aback by this.  She wants me‚Ä¶.to destroy‚Ä¶. No way! Just. No. 

Me: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, I cannot destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúWHAT?! You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it, what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent out?!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWell, that dress is now YOURS since you bought it. You can do with it what you will, and if you return it, then it becomes the property of the company again,  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor. The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúI RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS! YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANT!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI am not going to destroy company property. You can return the dress or I can find one at another store. Those are your options. I am not risking my job by destroying company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúTHAT IS BULL SHIT! YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! I RAN A BUSINESS! I KNOW! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAlright, MOD (who has been listening the whole time) this client would like to speak with you.‚Äù

The MOD comes over and I walk away, continue to tidy up the store and do my job. Then I see the MOD take the client‚Äôs dress‚Ä¶. And the dress on the floor‚Ä¶. I'm thinking that she CAN'T POSSIBLY be doing what I think...Yes, the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DB‚Äôs dress. 

Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on. During the entire time DB won‚Äôt stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy, etc etc etc.  She then turns to me again and tells me ‚ÄúLosing your job over making a customer happy? That is SUCH bullshit! I don‚Äôt know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPY.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond, it will be nasty. 
DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes over.

MOD: ‚ÄúMystic-Spiral, I‚Äôm sorry that I went over your head and did that. I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didn‚Äôt want a scene.‚Äù 

I REALLY loved that MOD, she was like another mom to me, but I absolutely could not respond to her. I don‚Äôt think I said a word for the rest of the evening. The whole thing boils my blood even now. 

So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave, you can get someone to destroy company property just so you don‚Äôt have to fork over a few cents for a replacement button at a fabric store.

Sapphires13,19,,19,1r8o2i,,96,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""   
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""   
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""   
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""   
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""   
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""   

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""   
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""   
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""    
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""    
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""   
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]    
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""    
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""   
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""    
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",115,talesFromRetail

Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

KroipyBill,11,,41,1rhynu,,124,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

thompsontoons_art,16,,15,1r9l9k,,98,"Customer walks up to me just as I'm about to go on my late afternoon lunch break. She says she's there to pick up an order for [X person name: We'll call her Fuddle Duddle], and it should be a couple of bedskirts. She received a call that the order was in. Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse. I go to our holds area to find the order...

...there's no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me. I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer. 

""Ma'am, you said your name is Fuddle Duddle? I don't see any orders out back with that name attached.""

""Well, no. My name is Sue. Fuddle is my friend; I'm in the area, so she asked me to pick up her order for her.""

The next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up. Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few large-ish purchases. Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure she'd paid for the order being shipped to the store, and it just needed to be picked up. I look through our log book listing paid for pick-up orders, and there was no listing of Fuddle's name in the book. I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for; if this was the case, our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after 48hrs. Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts. I tried looking up Ms. Duddle's customer information in our register and through our catalog system, and I found no purchase records at all. 

""Well, that can't be right,"" Sue said, ""We were here in the store. We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff. We were here for hours. You must have a record."" I informed her that their purchases would be in our records, but they wouldn't be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them. Since their names didn't come up in our profile search, I figured they'd opted out of having a profile created. 

Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information. Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle. I inquire what style bedskirt it was that she'd ordered for pick up, and she said she couldn't really describe it. (She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store, but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasn't available in store at the time.) Supposedly it was a plain tailored style, and she had a receipt for the item at home... but she wasn't at home that very moment, so she couldn't give me the information on the receipt. She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt, but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order... which she said is, ""...a queen sized dust ruffle in white... or maybe it was two twins."" She couldn't even remember what she ordered. I described a couple of the styles to her, and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely. I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone else's name, and she said no... but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up. So... we had a third person involved in this order. I took down Fuddle's phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce, who was originally called and notified about the order, and I told her we'd give her a call once we sort the issue out.

Sue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddle's order (Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine, which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go). Sue looks at me saying, ""So, if you eventually find this bedskirt, you'll have to mail it to us for free, right? I don't want to drive another 60 miles to come pick it up, and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow it's not."" I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them. Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leave.

Meanwhile, my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddle's original purchase... which has a queen sized bedskirt on it. ""She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store, and they left with her."" What could she have possibly ordered? We went back to the holds area. There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased... under Fuddle's neighbor Pierce's name and contact phone number... and it was unpaid for. I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadn't pulled out of the parking lot yet. They were gone. My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store. We're just hoping things will work out so we don't have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information. The neighbor does get a hold of Sue, she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friend.

**TL:** Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend. Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we can't track down the order that's supposed to be in store.

GrimGuy,29,,19,1r0zg2,,93,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

Fixer_,14,,19,1r8gem,,92,"**Background:**I work at a popular electronics/appliance store as a Computer &amp; Tablets Sales Consultant. I love my job. However, we get our fair share of nasty customers! 

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

At this point i offer to go get my supervisor, and the man accepts. I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown. At this point I don't interact with the customer again. Apparently, my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said. He (Being the awesome supervisor he is) refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price, saying ""Sir, it's mid November, we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on display.

According to my Sup, the man said nothing but ""I'll be back."" and walked out of the store. 

I'm not sure when he will be back, but I hope he isn't as big of an asshole next time!","""I'll be back!""",111,talesFromRetail
kemmer,37,,23,1rbkuk,,92,"Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino. I've worked at several other retail jobs since then, and the casino job is easily the worst I've ever had. The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money, and they took out that anger and frustration on us. Some stories...

**Orientation:**

Everyone that was starting work in the casino that week, no matter the job or department, took part in the same orientation. It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms, but it ended in a tour of the whole property. We saw the high roller suites, the ballrooms, all the restaurants, etc. While touring the steakhouse (the most expensive restaurant), the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available. He pulled out a bottle of one (I don't remember what it was now, probably Cristal or something like that), and told us how lucky we were to see it up close, because *none of us would ever be able to afford it*. It's been 7 years since I had that job, and the memory of that STILL pisses me off. I was 17 years old, that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make. Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers, there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting. It's been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu. Just for my own satisfication, you know? I should have known then this job was gonna suck.

**Counting:**

I'm not gonna front, I'm pretty bad at math. I'm fairly intellegent otherwise, graduated college with a 3.85 GPA, but I've just never been able to wrap my head around numbers. One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink. The order was something like $12.08. He handed me $13, I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him 92 cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter. I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now. It honesly couldn't have been more than 3 seconds that I hesitated, but in that time he started screaming, literally screaming, at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been. But he couldn't stop there, oh no, he had to *call his wife over* so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were. ""Can you believe it?! How can they hire people this dumb?!"" I had figured out his change in the meantime, handed it to him, turned around and sobbed over the chili. The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgust.

**Suicide:**

My most memorable day working at the casino, and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever. This place was essentially like Disneyland, in that there was a whole underground world for the employees. We had our own stores, our own bank, our own cafeteria, etc. To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli, we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing. The parking garage was right outside the deli doors. One day I was walking back to work after my break, when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage. I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground, mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids. I couldn't tell what was going on, but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli. Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage. They had already removed the body, but I got to see the remnants. The image of that will forever stick in my brain.

Those are my ""best"" stories, but that doesn't even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car, the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company, or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families (neither knew of the other). I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time. Those cookies were damn good.

TL;DR: Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth.

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

I tell her

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

Luca20,38,,24,1ragja,,87,"I work at a large retail store that sells mostly hardware and wood products.  I work in the lumber area with only male coworkers.  This means that most of my coworkers pretty much whip their junk out if a woman customer comes in. 
Last Saturday(we get lots of clueless DIYers on the weekend) a lady came in needing some molding cut to length.  This lady was so hot that I wanted to avoid looking like I'm showing her special treatment (most guys are guilty of this).. 
She was in her late 20's(I'm 21).  She was about 6'0"" had gorgeous blond hair, extremely dark brown eyes, and the ass was fat.  The only problem was she had these Gary Busey eyes.  She was clearly not normal.  She somehow seemed like the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" type.  The kind that will laugh manically at everything with eyes *really* wide open.  I did everything I could to just stay professional.
Eventually she finds the molding she wants and asks me to rip it........meaning to cut it lengthwise.  It's called ""quarter round"" you might have some in the room your sitting in right now http://www.paramount-floors.com/i/Quarter_Round_White_Oak_1.jpg this means to cut that piece into a 45 degree prism. ""You've got to be shitting me"" I thought.  ""Surely she's just trying to be funny, or fuck with me"".  She just stared back with her crazy Gary Busey eyes.  After 5 seconds of silence, I look up chuckling and say ""you know I really can't do that, right?""  She stands right up against me, chest now pressed on the back of my arm, ""gosh, this piece of molding, ripped, would be perfect for my project..""
""This bitch is crazy"" I thought"".  Cutting a piece of wood that tiny by hand will look ridiculous, no matter how hard I try. After quite some time of telling her that it will look like crap, she still insists.  So I get a Drimmel  http://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Cordless-8300-01-Dremel-Multi-Max-12V-Oscillating-Tool.jpg and get to it, very, very slowly. 
It takes me about 40 minutes to rip the (2) 10.5 foot pieces of molding, and it still looks like it was cut by a drunken sailor.  I give them to her with a smile and a ""no problem"".

She isn't *just* being friendly and I'm not sure what she's getting at.
When she leaves, I see her pick up my card, and wink.  
I get a picture message from an unknown number that night.  It reads ""heyyy Luca20, that quarter round worked out really well!""  With a picture of her, showing a*lot* more chest, splintery jagged molding in the background.

ExcerptMusic,18,,13,1rahbf,,87," I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues. Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it. However, there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults.

 Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phone.

Keep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes. I am being as nice as possible on the outside.

I had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone. I knew it wasn't going to be fun to figure out because he had on the ""fuck you"" face and looked to be in the ""ignorant with technology"" age range. He presented me with 3 problems

1. My alarm doesn't alert me in the morning and I need it for work.

2. The outside keys don't lock so the phone turns the speaker on.

3. The battery runs out when I unplug it at night.

He then followed by ""I bought this phone 30 days ago and want to return it"" and ""I've been with this company for 10 years""

 Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the ""I've been shopping here for X amount of years""... This company doesn't care about you personally.. they just don't. This isn't some mom &amp; pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business. This is a multi-BILLION dollar company. They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those 10 years, because I guarantee this isn't your first time complaining. 

 So you bought the phone 30 days ago? Sorry you can't return it. There is a 14 day return policy on phones company wide. This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors (which doesn't happen). We could also get the manufacturer to replace it (if there is actually a problem with it). There was no problem with the phone so there is 100% nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone. So I check it out and explain to him what is going on.

 The alarm.. First off, his alarm was off. He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesn't work. I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdays(I did this for him). He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off 5 minutes after it was supposed to. I tested the alarm feature about 15 times. No issues. If it happened every time like he said, I would have seen it at least once. Even after telling him that the alarm was off, he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically. No. It wasn't. Next issue.

 The outside keys wouldn't lock. Ok. This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys. He also has a horizontal belt carrier. He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him, he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didn't do that. I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling. You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call. After talking more with him, I figured out why his old phone didn't have that issue. He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone. Next issue.

 The battery runs out at night. This one is just stupid... He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night, he unplugs it and leaves it open. The phone also has the screen timeout disabled. So at night, he unplugs the phone at 100%, leaves it open fully lit, and goes to bed. Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead. He must sleep with the lights on or something, I don't know. I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in (even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years). A problem with battery capacity in 2 years isn't going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because ""the phone dies at night"".

 Now that i've fixed his issues, he says that he will try it out but he doesn't expect it to work because it was the phone. 

 Sorry guy, it wasn't the phone. It was user error through and through. Don't blame technology for your mishaps. Technology isn't some black magic. 90% of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read. If the alarm says ""OFF"" then the alarm is off. It's that simple. 

 As much as I hate these people, I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues. It's almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door. I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it. Seriously, those are the best customers ever..

TL;DR- User error accounts for most errors.

LossPreventionSucks,24,,21,1rfcsa,,85,"This is my first time posting here, but I'll just warn you this can get a bit winded.  I've yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy, as my manager mentioned I should ""keep quiet"" about the whole ordeal.


Now... I work for a popular gaming store chain.  I'm sure you can guess which one.  I've heard the horror stories, however I've had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention Manager.

To start the day off, I had to open.  I went in about 15 minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch.  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in.  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didn't go over hours and he was totally fine with that.  Anyway... 2 minutes after walking through the door, a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling ""I'M HERE! LET ME IN!""  I ignore them for the first 5 minutes (I mean, gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and it's almost 2 hours before open).  I walk up to them and inform them we open at 10.  The man quickly snaps ""Bullshit! We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release!"".  So I texted my manager and, sure enough, he said ""Absolutely not.  If they're picking a system up, let them in, though.""  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with ""No, I want to return this stuff"" holding up at least $400 worth of XBox games and a system.  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down.  He finally agreed and left only to call every 2 minutes or so and ask if we were open, yet... For the next hour and a half.  Now, because this guy was so persistent, I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didn't have to wait for the 20 minute timer to go up.  I figured he'd come back right away.  That was my first mistake.  He never did come back and, due to us being so busy and me being the only one there, I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bit.


On to the second half... I was there alone all morning.  I had several people asking for systems, which require me to go through a locked door, through a hallway, and into another locked door to get to.  I have to do this for each system whether or not 3-4 people in line are waiting for a system.  This gives 5-10 minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store.  So what did I do?  I propped the first door open.  Mistake number two.


After a bit, my part-timer came in.  45 minutes after opening (I repeat, we were open for 45 whole minutes, at this point... 30 of which I had spent alone with nearly 30 customers in the store picking up systems)... In walks our Loss Prevention guy.  I didn't know he was Loss Prevention, though... No... He instantly walks in, starts yelling at my part-timer about the door, and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there.  Still no introduction, the following commenced:

FatLossPreventionMan:  ""Why the hell is the back door open?""

Me:  ""Can I help you?""

FatLP:  ""IS YOUR SAFE OPEN?  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING"" (remember, there's multiple people in the store at this point, several in line)

Me: *oh fuck*  ... stutter... stutter...""Yeah, there was an incident this morning where I had a return, but he never showed up.  I also needed to add change to the register""

FatLP: ""You can't do this.  Are you the manager?""

Me: ""No, may I ask who you are?""

FatLP: *beaming* ""I'm Dave.  I'm here to audit and help with customers"".

Me:  ""Okay.  Yeah, I messed up.  It's been a hectic morning.""

After this exchange, he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store.  Mind you... I'm not the manager.  I'm not even assistant manager.  I'm a store worker who gets paid 50 cents more than minimum wage with manager duties.  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs 7 feet in the air, saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them (I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how).  He then answered phones with just ""Hi, this is Dave"".  No greeting, nothing... Just... Dave.  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didn't know the answer... These people then called back so they could complain to me.


At this point, he had yelled at my coworker and I, loomed over us, and degraded us so badly that I was near tears.  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how ""pathetic"" this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing.  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I.  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on, giving no personal space.  The customer asks ""Are you okay?"" and Dave butts in ""She's fine... Do you want the GPG?"".  I said nothing... I was beaten and I couldn't do anything.  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about 90 different things that I had done that was a terminable offense.  I was afraid if I said anything more, that I would be done... And I need this job.  


Anyway... There's a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share (mostly from corporate), but this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.


TL;DR:  Shitty customers banging on the door.  I screw up.

I'm a rather short (5'3""), and slim girl, so I definitely do not give off a ""strong"" vibe (I am much more so than most people think though, that type of job definitely can keep you in shape).

 Most of the time, it's older customers who seem almost worried for me, as in a ""are you sure that's not too heavy for you?"" when I'm clearing off a table. Yes, I can, otherwise I would not be carrying all of this, that would be silly. I appreciate the concern, but no need to make comments.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

One of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while I'm lifting it, and says ""You shouldn't do that! You're a girl! You're not nearly strong enough to do that!""

Minja78,35,,18,1rgqvv,,78,"Preface, I sell cars in the Pacific Northwest.  This story occurred back in October.   
    
It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)     

Me, ""Mam for me to get you even a small percentage of these option I would need a time machine, what you asking for simply does not exist.""     
    
UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""    
   
Me, ""What your asking for doesn't exist, I think the closest you'll come is the new Tesla but I can't think of anything in the mainstream car world that's even close to half of your list.""

BuffHipster,5,,13,1r556k,,72,"Was suggested to cross post here from [this AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r2b9l/whats_the_most_insulting_thing_you_ever_said_to). My buddy destroyed an asshole customer with a solid one-sentence send off. Enjoy!

&gt;Not me, but my friend. He was at work, and apparently some asshole customer was berating a new employee, like new as in fresh out of training. This customer was a repeat offender to this type of stuff, people who work retail know the type. My buddy, having worked there for a year or two, comes up and tells the new employee, ""Go, I'll take care of this."" Before the customer can tear into him, he said in a quiet voice, ""Your business is not worth your bullshit and the world would be a better place without you.""

&gt;Customer left speechless.

So bonus post-story stuff, I guess... so far, my buddy hasn't gotten in trouble for it, which he totally could as he is not a manager. As for context, the customer was using profanity and being blatantly unreasonable. This poor new employee literally walked out of the training room to go the bathroom, and customer asked him a question, and then proceeded to ""How could you not know where this is? What fucking use are you? *BLAH BLAH BLAH SO MAD*.""

abbeyinreallife,13,,18,1r1eap,,70,"I work in your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store, and I've had the job for around 2 months. For a majority of the time, I've been the designated punching bag (aka ""guest services"") in the store. I run the phones, announcements, returns, special orders, cashiering, complaints, etc. in my little box. 

Today was a surprisingly slow day, but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out. We had a line of maybe 6 or 7 parties, and I was checking people out along with 2 other cashiers. Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns. Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

*She went and grabbed one of our reusable bags*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

ME: ""..kay. Your total is [total]."" *she pays me in cash*

I had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change, but I restrained myself!

HER: ""That cashier is so nasty."" *leaves*

After closing, I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people ""oh you don't mind do you?"" as she pushed past, yelled at the cashier for ""blinding her"" with the red scanner light, and tried to get her to give her a discount without a coupon.

Needless to say, we were not sad to see her go.

Maloth_Warblade,6,,19,1rhx0y,,91,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,14,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

HeloRising,16,,15,1ra3ti,,64,"Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it, I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one I'd forgotten.

This was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day. Alas, the day was not to remain so. A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves. She smiled and I greeted her, asked her if she was looking for anything in particular, she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that. 

About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried. 

(Note the punctuation in her statement is very. very. deliberate.)

""Umm...I'm trying to decide on one of these It's for my daughter she's graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldn't have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I don't know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe that's a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe they'd go well in her new place but I don't know for sure what it looks like because it's all the way out past the freeway and--""

This goes on for quite some time. I'm overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything she's saying because it's coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesn't seem to want to slow down. I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned. After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesn't intend to stop. Like ever. 

At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security. This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stay-at-home moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasn't unheard of and it was starting to look like she'd either taken too much or too little of something strong.

By now she'd begun almost a full-blown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast. Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly. Also she'd stopped focusing on me, she was no longer looking directly at me anymore. She had this kind of ""thousand yard stare"" going on. 

Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting. Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point, spewing molten crazy on everything around her.

Just before the ten minute mark, she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out. We were watching a grown human being have a full-blown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shop...and we hadn't the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it. She'd gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice, unreasonably hot coworker told the security guard:

""A customer is having a nervous breakdown, what's the policy on that?"" 

It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression you'd expect on people's faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP; profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascination.

Eventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to just...staring off into space with her mouth slightly open. We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact, who I assume was her husband. He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store. He didn't explain what was going on, just thanked us for calling him and left with her. I never did see her again after that.

Part of me is amazed I'd forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it.

TaterSaladDelta,19,,24,1rcu4v,,64,"  So my brother manages a seasonal fireworks tent every year. He lets me work there and gives me a small cut of his final check. I usually just clean up/ring up the occasional customer. More often than not I'm just hanging out. This year we were pretty busy and the tent was packed. It was a few nights before the fourth of July and we were going nuts trying to keep up.

  That's when I saw him. **Bubby**. He looked like a normal guy, late 50's, hispanic, balding slightly. But he was far from normal. He wandered in with his oversized flannel and adidas slip-ons and started scanning the big assortments. Like $200 big. He had a different handler every night, most likely family, that would translate for him. 

  He decided he wanted the biggest thing there and was waiting in line. I was on bag duty and as I handed out bags I would occasionally glance up at each customer. I would catch a glimpse of him every time, one spot closer, ready to seal my doom. He'd do this disturbing thing with his mouth, sort of like [this](http://youtu.be/AFbYU1xpR9Q?t=6s) and stare me down. I knew I was in his sights. I was marked. He had me targeted and I wasn't getting away. 

  The line was going slowly and he didn't like that. He would crane his head up to look at me and point to his assortment, he would snap at me and motion to ""come here"". He didn't speak english but he would say ""bubby bubby bubby"". I could hear him over the roar of the other customers, beckoning for me to assist him. I just tried to ignore it and let him get bored of trying to summon me. Then he was next. 

  *Oh Shit*

  Until that moment I didn't know his translators couldn't translate for shit. He slams the assortment down and points to it like an expectant toddler. He then said something in English.

""Free for me?""

  **damnit**

  Like most customers that don't speak English, he had seen the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE banner with (selected items only) in small print and wanted his free fireworks. We tried to explain to him that he needs to buy a product marked for the deal but he wasn't having it. His eyes narrowed and his weird lip thing intensified. He pointed to the assortment again and his translator tried to help. I don't know what she said but he went into a rage so glorious I almost laughed right at him. 

  He started yelling ""**BUBBY BUBBY BUBBY, FREE FOR ME**"" and I thought he was about to chew his own lips off. Eventually he calmed down and overpaid by about $20 for the assortment but he came back numerous times, piss drunk, and bought huge amounts of fireworks and every time he would pull *me* aside and spout ""bubby, bubby, bubby"" at me. Then demand his free fireworks.

So, we're a clothing store and I usually don't have too many interesting stories to tell but this one from tonight was quite interesting.

So the first guy waves me towards him. He has a necklace in his hand and asked me if the symbol on it is a satanic symbol. I'm quite confused and just mutter ""uhhh, no"". He then tells me that ""Oh nonono, I'm no satanist, just askin', don't think that!""


And I'm like ""No worries, man""


Then he proceeds to put his hands into his trousers, fondling around in his ball-area. I just think ""Well, odd but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do""


He then pulls out 25‚Ç¨ which confuses the fuck out of me. He then starts grinning like a little child and proudly proclaims that he always keeps his cash by his junk.

""I was mugged...by a raven."" And looks exactly like someone who thinks of a terrifying thing that happened in the past. 


I just stood there in silence, not sure whether to laugh or to be worried. And hoping that he won't pay with his junk-money.


He obviously doesn't have anything to say to me anymore so I go somewhere else to tidy up a little bit.

I have no idea what he's talking about and ask him what that is.

One particular lady took offense to this rule. As soon as my coworker mentioned the policy, this lady started **screaming**
 about how, ""this is ridiculous!"" and, ""What? You want me to shop **after** the 25th????"" My coworker patiently explained to the customer that these items were seasonal and that we don't normally stock them, but that still wasn't good enough.   
  
The woman started yelling for a manager. My coworker called my manager and confirmed with her on the phone that the 30 days was mandatory. This *still* wasn't good enough. My manager had to come to the front and explain to this woman that we have no control over the return policy and how corporate will not allow us to process returns at a later date. **Still** not good enough.  
  
This lady started demanding to speak to someone even *higher* up. My manager at this point was fed up with this idiot's rudeness and told her that our store manager (who was off today) would be in contact with her. My coworker quickly processed her transaction and tried to hurry her out the door.    
  
Of course, she managed to find someone she knew and spent the next 15 (I counted) minutes telling them about how *insane* our policies are (because of course *we're* the crazy ones here). My favorite line of hers'? **""I'm a business woman!""** Lady, I don't know how you're *still* in business. Even my *customers* thought you were out of your fucking mind.

amylondon,21,,11,1rdnjq,,67,"Hi all, I no longer work in a betting shop, having left a couple of months ago due to the unpleasant environment, but I do have some stories from my time there. For the Americans, a betting shop would be called a sportsbook over there, and here they're generally known for containing the... not so nice members of society.

Anyway, here's one story I can remember, and I apologise, I'm not a very talented writer.

So I'm working with my colleague at around 9pm (we shut at 10). The shop is empty which is a rare and pleasant surprise. A man walks in and asks for money to be loaded onto one of the gaming machines. These are machines where you can play virtual roulette, slots etc. and the customers can put their money in themselves or we can do it from behind the counter if they're paying by card. Now, due to strict gambling laws and company policy, if they pay by card their winnings have to be returned to them back onto their card. This is to prevent fraud. 

The man comes up to the counter and quite rudely says he wants ¬£50 on the machine. I take his card and inform him before processing the transaction that any winnings will be put back onto the card he paid with. He does not like this at all, raising his voice to me saying it‚Äôs his money and he wants it back in cash. I say that‚Äôs not possible as its policy. He grumbles for a bit but accepts and plays his game. Two minutes later he kicks the machine and I notice he‚Äôs lost his ¬£50. He comes back up to the counter and wants ¬£100 to be put on this time, I again inform him all winnings are to go back onto the card (I have to for every transaction). He loses it. He starts screaming and shouting at me that I never told him that before. I tell him I did and he previously argued with me about it, and my colleague was next to me at the time and also heard it. He goes on a rant about how I now need to pay him his LOST money back and he wants a refund. He gave me the ‚Äòultimatum‚Äô of refunding his ¬£50 or letting him pay by card and get his winnings back in cash. What the fuck? You want me to give you back money you gambled away and lost? He was shouting at me saying I stole his money, he‚Äôs kicking things and he‚Äôs just generally losing his shit. I had to call the police as he refused to leave, and they escorted him out. They laughed when I told them what happened.

Best part? He was wearing his branded work uniform which is a fairly upmarket supermarket, and I had his full name from his card. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs still been kicking off since I left. May have to call his employers and let them know about their colleagues behaviour, after all, he *is* representing their company when he‚Äôs in his uniform.",Refund my money,78,talesFromRetail

I put in my two weeks notice at the big box pet retail store not long after I accepted a job as a teller at a local bank. I just wanted to share something that happened yesterday that was pretty much one of the most ridiculous things I've been asked. Not dramatic, just ridiculous.

So this older woman walks in the door and up to my register. She holds out her hand and says, ""Can you tell me what kind of treat this is?"" She's holding a single treat. No bag, no nothing. Just the treat. Coincidentally I had bought the same kind for my dog before, so I showed her exactly where they were. I made my way back to the register. 

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws).

biohzrd451,15,,13,1r61h1,,64,"Hello there first time poster long time reader. This is going back to the summer of 2001 when I was pulling a stint in a Mom and Pop pizza joint in a small town.

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box. I mean the dude threw a full on temper tantrum and slung his boxes across the counter making a huge mess.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

Over the past year and a half, I had many things happened, that I still cringe to this day. But far worst was yesterday. It was a typical afternoon, and a little old woman comes up to my register holding a very squirming puppy and some dog food. W is for woman, M is for me:

W- Can I put the puppy on the belt for just a moment while I get my wallet out and pay?

M- Yea sure, I'll turn off the belt. 


Now at this moment, the cute puppy poops and pees all over my belt. Like diarrhea bad.

shadowmanwkp,12,,18,1r1q8g,,63,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around ‚Ç¨2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.

**""I shouldn't have to pay $200 for a plate!""**

No, you shouldn't. You can buy the plate for $6 right now if you want, or you can buy the groceries you normally buy every week and get it for free in like 2 weeks.

**""So if I don't take the stickers, I'm basically paying for the plates for the people who do!""**

You just spent $250. I would hand you 25 stamps, enough to get a free plate right here, right now. But even after I explain that, you still refuse because you can't get a full set all at once from these stamps alone. Even though with how much you spend here weekly, you'd get a full set in a month.

trinidadnomad,21,,15,1r9s8q,,60,"I used to work for an electronic store and throughout the years things got kooky and crazy but this incident was one of the funniest we have ever had.

Ok so a couple of years back we started selling Hex bugs and for a while the sales were slow until one day I noticed our hex bug stock was low. I was so happy we were selling them so I decided to check our inventory on them to see how many had been sold that day. I looked and noticed we had sold 3.....but there was 7 missing from the display. I frantically started to search for them but found nothing and at that point told the manager and we decided to start paying attention more to them. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I notice we had some people come in and I noticed a girl went and stopped by the hex bugs for a second then took off. I was curious and decided to check our stock. Sure enough we were short one hex bug. I reported it and we started to keep an eye out on the hex bugs. 

A couple days passed and my coworker spots a girl come in and go to the hex bugs then leave. He calls me and we check the inventory again and sure enough we were missing two more hex bugs. At this point I started wondering why they were disappearing and I started thinking constantly about it. In fact it became a mild obsession and I started looking at all the angles and it was starting to drive me mad. A couple of days later I had enough of it. I grabbed a hex bug and took it out to play with it and didn't see the big deal about it. Here is what it looks like

At that point the light in my head turned on and it went ""DING""  Holy crap in a hat Eureka! I took it out of the packaging and turned it on then put it back in the packaging and everything made sense. We had girls coming into our store and stealing the hex bugs because they were cheap vibrators!!!!! I presented my find with my evidence to my coworkers about my theory and everyone confirmed the hex bugs tend to disappear when ever girls would come into the store. Unanimously all of us agreed and decided to put the hex bugs in our view at all times to see if my theory check out to be true.

Later that day we had a girl come in and came up to the hex bugs next to the register. One of my coworkers asked her if she needed help and she darted out of the store. We were amazed and in awe of what had been happening in our little store. We presented my findings to the store manager and she made sure we kept the hex bugs on the counter at all times. She didn't want to ""contribute to deviant behavior"".


I don't know if y'all enjoyed my story but i've had it under raps for years and now that I don't work there I decided to start rolling out my stories from the time I served. Let me know what you think!!!!

unidentifiableblarg,12,,12,1rhfwt,,62,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,64,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

So the other night I went to go see the new Hunger Games movie. It was Friday night and it was absolutely packed in the theater. Everyone was behaving themselves and seemed pretty excited about the movie.

Well, before the movie started, a group in the aisle next to me was taking a few pictures with flash. I thought it was mildly irritating, but, the movie hadn't started at that point so whatever.


Queue 15 minutes into the movie. Suddenly, out of the darkness, a really annoying camera flash. Like, the ones that do a few flash blips then a big FLASH. Everyone in that radius violently swivels their head towards him. Nobody says anything. Maybe he wouldn't do it again.


About 10 minutes later. ANOTHER flash. Seriously dude? Do those pictures even come out well? We live in 2013, you know what you are doing it completely fucking rude. I've seen people texting, talking, and even taking phone calls during a movie. Nothing topped that dude.


Well, he did it one more time. I'm not sure if anyone near him tried to say anything, but at that point I was pissed and needed to go get some popcorn anyways. I went to guest services and told them about the camera dude. I just wanted them to tell the dude to knock it off.


The guest service guys were SO AWESOME. They were really apologetic (not their fault!) and they gave me a free movie pass. I honestly didn't care about getting the free pass, but it seemed like they appreciated me saying something in advance. One of the employees goes into the theater and is watching in the back. Of course, Camera flash dude never took another picture for the rest of the movie. At this point, I was almost disappointed that he didn't take another picture. What if the movie employees thought I just conned my way into getting a free movie ticket? And the guy who followed me back into the theater was totally eating dinner. I felt bad about that. Hopefully karma bites that hunger-games-camera-douche in the ass. 


Anyone else (movie patrons or employees) have similar stories?",To the guy who was taking pictures with flash at the movies last Friday:,60,talesFromRetail
KDR3989,9,,11,1ra3wz,,55,"I'm reasonably new to this subreddit (and reddit in general) but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here. I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories. This one in particular is inspired by /u/unmined most recent story.

Quick back story: I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school. After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chain

Our story begins on my first day of work. Which happened to coincide with my birthday . . . 

I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go. At this point I've just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens. After all, spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isn't exactly a dream come true. He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker (lets call him B)as to make sure I don't screw it up. At the time the department wasn't terribly large (at least not as big as it is now) so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall. As far as I was concerned the department didn't exist past the DVD racks, and B and myself were the only employees in the department. As soon as I'm starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what I'm doing I hear a female voice behind me, ""So this is the new guy, huh?""

I turn to see where the words are coming from and I'm completely blind-sided by what stands before me. She is the girl I've been searching my entire life for and I didn't even know it. She stands eye level with me (about 5'7"" if it matters) with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades. Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I can't look in to them for too long in fear I'll never find my way back out. I can smell a faint sweetness when she's near, almost like vanilla, which I find out later is from her body wash. In short, she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever want.

B finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only 2 seconds, ""Yea, his name's . . . what's your name again?""

In that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember, ""It's . . . umm . . . KDR3989!""

She cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle, ""That's an interesting name, where you named after [Insert Actor]""

Around the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work, ""Honestly, I'm not sure. I never thought enough to ask.""

""Heh, well I guess I'll see you around then!""

I wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner. I can still smell vanilla and she's all I can think about for the rest of my shift.

We continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation, except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases. Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasn't a very pleasant person to be around, and the word ""bitch"" was used a few times. It wasn't until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time together.

Our manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink. It was essentially a 5 foot tall, 10 foot wide section of madness. She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days. I find out the day she starts working on it that I'm the one that gets to help from our manager. As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers, ""I know this isn't gonna be a fun project and she isn't always the most friendly person but at least she isn't bad to look at!"" I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of this project.

During this time we talk . . . a lot. About everything from interests and hobbies, to our coworkers, where we grew up and everything in between. As it would happen most of our interests coincide. She reads comics as well, she's into computers (albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker), and we actually grew up only 15 miles from each other but in different school districts.

After that week of work I had decided, she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends. Eventually she stopped inviting the friends. And from there things ran their course. 

This story took place over 4 years ago. I'm very happy to say that I haven't changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her, and she hasn't either. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, retail is awful. The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid, and the pay is never enough to make up for it. We're on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee, but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life forever.

Stachahof,5,,13,1r0j3k,,50,"This is my first time posting here but I've been lurking for quite a while.  I work in a used media store that's privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part, I love it.  I get great discounts, I have plenty of regular customers who I like, and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no big-bad corporate to answer to.

Then there are the drawbacks.  Threats and cursing from customers who don't like their cash/trade offers and just overall rude people.  We also cater to low-income people because our prices are so low (the majority of our stock costs no more than $2.50) and while I don't want to generalize, a lot of them aren't the most desirable type of person.

This particular story happened about a month ago.  The couple in question is fairly regular, though I haven't seen much of them since this happened, but I've never liked them much.  They're usually pretty loud and dismissive.  

This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadn't worked.  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie.  No problem, my co-worker scanned their receipt and credited them $2.67 and they went to shopping.  

When they were finished, they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out.  As I took them, the man kept one and told me he didn't have to pay for that one because he'd brought another back.  We'll call him Dumb Fuck.

Me: No problem sir, I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer system.
DF: But I don't have to pay for it.
Me: You won't, sir.  I just need to scan it.

Reluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies.  I apply their discount and their total ends up being $10.68 for five movies.  The man pays and I think it's finished when he turns to his wife and says to her, not to me, ""She charged me for that movie.""

Immediately I'm irritated that he's talking about me as though I'm not there, but I bite my tongue and explain to him that he'd only paid for four movies.  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that I've over-charged him.  I pick up his movies, which I haven't bagged yet, and stack them on top of each other, adding the cost of them as I go.

""$2.67, $5.34, $8.01, $10.68, $13.35.""  Then I took off the top movie, the one he'd gotten for free, and set it aside.  ""$10.68.  You only paid for four movies, sir."" I smile.

DF: I can't believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refund.

I really have to fight back my anger at this point.

Me: Would you like me to go through the math again for you, sir?

A miracle, he finally addresses me.

DF: I don't need anyone to do math for me, I'm real good at math.

He complains for a couple more minutes, but eventually he takes his movies and leaves, still convinced that he overpaid for them.  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my co-worker to please watch the floor for a minute.  He couldn't stop laughing.","""She charged me!""",63,talesFromRetail

Sigillite,22,,20,1r4dqa,,50,"**Warning, language**

Posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qxrkh/so_long_and_thanks_for_well_nothing/) a couple of days ago about the lovely way the shitty co-owner of the restaurant I used to work at let me know that she was letting me go. but just not scheduling me! lovely. quick recap: I changed my availability for one shift, restaurant doesnt schedule me anymore, condescending owner wont return my calls. 

I called in today, two weeks after the fact, hoping to finally talk to her. Sure enough, she was there. I wish I had written it down so I could give you a more accurate transcript, but honestly, though most of it I was at a loss for words. FYI it is a small restaurant, with 2 bartenders and 2-3 servers on at one time taking 6-7 tables each. 

**Steph:** Thank you for holding this is Stephanie how can I help you?

**Me:** Hi Stephanie this is Dan

**S:** Hi Dan how's it going

**Me:** *thinking, seriously?* I was calling in to see why I wasnt scheduled the past two weeks, and why noone called me to tell me what was going on.

**S:** I wanted to talk to you about that, you see when you changed your availability we couldnt find any other shifts for you. You will have to switch with somebody to work three shifts a week.

**M:** What are you talking about, I opened up my availability when I said I couldnt work thursdays anymore. I am only trying to work three shifts a week, but I can do Monday through Friday nights, Friday and Saturday morning. How can you not find anything?

*At this point I'm not giving a fuck if I keep this job or not, I want this snide mother f-er to explain herself*

**S:** But people already have those shifts, I cant just switch them for you. Most of the other people are full time, so we do set schedules.

*We go back and forth for a while, with me trying to figure out A) Why she cant just schedule me, and move shifts around so that they can get coverage Sundays where they need it and have me fill the gap and B) Why it took her so long to tell me this*

**S:** So youre going to need to have somebody give up a shift so that you can get three a week.

**M:** Can you give me the numbers of the people that work those nights?

**S:** I can't do that, Maryland law won't let us

*BULL. SHIT. Every restaurant I've ever worked at has the numbers posted by the schedule*

**M:** Can you tell me who is working those days, or who is available Sundays?

**S:** No

**M:** So basically, what youre saying is that I have to drive all the way up there *20 minute drive* to talk to the two servers that are on, because I cant switch with a bartender, and talk to them while they're working to see if they would be able to switch with me? Hoping that they're actually available and amenable to working Sundays, and is actually able to discuss it and think about it during a shift.

**S:** Right

**M:**.......ok. *Fuck it* I also wanted to tell you that not trying to get in touch with me about this, neither calling me nor emailing me or even returning a phone call is extremely unprofessional. I've never had a boss do this, especially since you acted like nothing had happened when **I** called **YOU** just now.

**S:** Well the last time you worked I wanted to talk to you about it but you just ran out.

M: Because I was done, we just cash out to the bartender we dont need to talk to you guys. I left because I was finished, I didnt know you wanted to talk to me, why didnt you let me know before I left so that I would stay?

**S:** I was working on a catering order

**M:** Okay, so what, you expected me to just hang around on a saturday, past the time when I was scheduled to be done, when I had plans later that night, on the off chance that you may want to talk to me?? Come on....

**S:**.....Well I am really busy right now so you'll need to come up here and talk to me about this.

**M:** Ok fine, but again, not reaching out or even returning my calls was extremely unprofessional.

*while Im hanging up on her* 
**S:** Ok. Bye


I dont remember being hired as a manager, so no, I dont think that I am going to take care of the scheduling for you. If it was impossible to find one shift that you could change, out of five different days and 10-12 different people, than you just cant do your job. Sorry. There are so many awful business practices at that place they are only saved by the high quality of the wait staff, that she treats like shit, and their awesome food which the other owner is solely responsible for.

We still had two groups of people sitting in the booths in the back of the restaurant (fast-food chicken joint). One of the tables, a few teenage girls, get up and leave. The other table was an older couple.

As all the employees from the back come up front to see what's going on, we hear the old man screaming ""TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON!""

**Second story, same day**

**Oh no it's your fault**

We have different depots that deal with different areas of the country, sometimes sales teams in H/O can change the default depot to something that might have it in stock, problem here is its on the other side of the country and you know can't travel through time and space - Every sales person knows (and it even tells the during the order process) to tell the customer delivery may be a few days later than their confirmation email since we have to get authorisation from a manager to ship it.

We get a call from H/O

Ho: Yeah err I have a customer on the line who was told he was getting delivery today and it hasn't arrived
me: Oh ok what's the details if you please

I check the order and nope, no one said nothing about delivery from our end

H/O: ""Well the customer is expecting it""
(I'm expecting to win the powerball but lookey here)

What's worse is the sales guy just kept saying the same thing, like literally ""Hes expecting it today"" no resolution, no ideas to the point I had to ask ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO""

He says he'll deal with it... 20 mins later we get a call, the customer called. I enter the details to see a note has been put on by our H/O that they told the customer to call us...Yeah thanks for that ass-socks now I get to explain the same thing all over again.

I explain to the customer he needed to wait for the auth from a manager before we could ship it out, he asked if he could cancel his order, I said unfortunately not.

Then. Karma. Came.

He paused and said ""Can I cancel it with them and take it with you?""

Usually we would say no, but I said ""Well if we were to do the order for you we wouldn't need the authorisation"" he replied with ""I demand you do it""

""Anything to keep the customer happy sir"" &lt;- at this point there was no suckyness from his part, he knew that there was a game that needed to be played and he knew that if this was brought to the big wigs he can say he demanded it and I just did what the customer wanted.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is boxes; Shall we begin?**

I‚Äôve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery service.

My job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego. Occasionally, a box would show up that did not belong in my area. Sometimes, it‚Äôs because of a mistake farther down the line, or it could be a bad address (street does not belong in ZIP code), or it could be a major fuck-up caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me, when it did not.

This is about a major fuck up.

At the beginning of the shift, the unloaders (people who emptied out the massive silver trailers) and the ‚Äúpresorters‚Äù (people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts - one of which went to me), were under the impression that a large mail-order company was now in my area. It was not. But that didn‚Äôt stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my way.

When I would get a misrouted box, I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet (if it was small enough). If it was too large, or if the belt near my feel got backed up, the box had to go to one of six guys in my area. This pissed them off when it happened, because they had to touch something that did not belong to them. (technical note: this company is absolutely insane with logistics; they preach the art of touching something a few times as possible).

I did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible. So as the crap came in, I rotated the victim. Everyone except Badass-Ponytail was understanding.

Badass-Ponytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him. Over the course of the first two hours, I got called: asshole, faggot, fucker, mother fucker, pussy, pansy, goddamn piece of shit, mongoloid (surprised at this one, since it required knowing what it meant), blind, inbred, etc). Loudly.

The environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter. It was a dirty, shitty environment, and there was absolutely no decorum. This may have changed over the years, but in this era, there was zero censorship.

Permissive or not, personal or not, I had enough. It wasn't my fault, and there was zero I could do about it. So, I gave everyone else a break and started sending 100% of the misrouted load to Badass-Ponytail. I mean, if I‚Äôm going to get abused, I might as well give him a reason.

Box after box went to him. He very quickly got backed up, since he couldn‚Äôt handle is regular workload on top of the crap. His anger started boil. He was getting truly and sincerely angry. The verbal assault gained volume, and he started calling out for a supervisor. A supervisor did arrive, and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap. So he told Badass-Ponytail to stop being a baby.

At the hour three mark, he exploded. He began throwing boxes at me from about 15 feet away. I shut my belt down, turned around and played wide receiver. He threw, I caught, then stuck the box back on his belt. After a couple minutes of this, I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna die motherfucker!‚Äù

Badass-Ponytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me. He is both larger and stronger than I am, and I knew that if there was any actual violence, I would likely get thrashed. So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shield.

He charged into me, and I thrust the box into his chest, causing him to lose balance. Instead if hitting me, he had to right himself, or he‚Äôd fall about three feet onto a steel grate.

After stumbling, his mind cleared. ‚ÄúOne more fucking misroute and I‚Äôm going to kill you after work.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you, you retarded piece of shit. You‚Äôre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth. As for after work, just try. I‚Äôll fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytail.‚Äù

Now, I said a lot of stuff working here. It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality. I mean, if I saw him waiting for me, I‚Äôd run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back. I hate fighting, and had managed to avoid it since middle school.

But it worked, and he backed down. ‚ÄúLook, hand the stuff out fairly and we‚Äôll be cool. But you keep fucking with me and we‚Äôll have a problem.‚Äù

I punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute, but went back to being ‚Äúfair‚Äù again. No asses were kicked that day.

I sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise. Looking back, I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was. Everywhere else I‚Äôve working in life, both of us would have been fired on the spot. And we would *deserve* it.

PepperAnn90,5,,11,1r4g87,,45,"I am a sales leader in a boutique-style, Swedish-inspired children's clothing store. The area is pretty affluent and educated, so we don't get very many people who have lost all common sense. This is a short story of someone who might have.

I was the sole person on the floor with about 6 customers in my store. I was deep in the process of a return when a lady asked if she could hold something at the register. Being such a small store, I said yes, as we can generally keep track of whose pile of stuff is whose and check them out when they're done shopping.

A few minutes later, I've finished the return and processed a few other transactions when I realize the lady has left the store, and left her items on the cash wrap. No name, no phone number, nothing. Just left. Okay...well, I can hold this for a bit and see if she comes back, I suppose.

Three hours later, she hasn't returned and we sell her items. I warn my relief manager (RM) that this lady might come back in, but I'm not sure. Two hours after that, I leave for the day.

The next day, I come in for my closing shift. RM from the day before had opened, and filled me in on what happened after I left:

Lady comes back and says she has items held for her. Nobody can find them, because we don't have them anymore. The lady got pissy and said, ""Well, the girl with the short reddish-brown hair said she would hold them for me."" (I am the ONLY person who works in my store who matches that description.) Essentially, RM told her that we didn't have any more in stock in the right size, so they could order it or she could wait until another came in. Lady decides against the dress, but RM does so much ass-kissing that she still makes a $600 sale.

I'm trying to figure out how she thought I could hold the items for her with no name, no phone number, and no time she would be back for them. Hell, I've been to department stores that require a credit card number for a hold. SOMETHING. Like, I can't just hold it for ""Short Blonde Lady with Baby in a Sling"". That's a physical description of about 30% of our customers. Ugh.

SatsumaForEveryone,26,,9,1rfgwv,,50,"Hi TFR, long time lurker, first time poster. I live in not-so-sunny Northern Ireland, which as you may or may not have heard has had some...differences between different branches of Christianity in the past. While the situation now is a lot better than it was 30-40 years ago, there are still some people who think it's still a big deal. I'm currently working in a clothing store in the centre of the capital, which is also one of the biggest targets for demonstrations and, well, attacks by these groups. Just yesterday a device partially exploded in a car in the city centre, and it's been in the news that massive protests have been planned for the Christmas period and there's a good chance that won't be the last bomb, either. Of course, these things are so common here that stores wouldn't consider closing, so I'm kinda forced to be in the middle of it all. So, if the worst happens, I love you all and thank you kindly for all the tales, retail is so much easier to deal with when you know you're not the only one suffering!",I may get bombed/attacked by protestors working in retail this Xmas,59,talesFromRetail
thelittleblueones,4,,13,1rahas,,44,"A quick one from back in my days as a cashier at a large grocery chain. I was 15 years old and wasn't too invested in the company, it was just a job to put a few dollars in my pocket. That said, I was fairly decent at the customer service aspect and only ever had one complaint. 

A mom and a young child, maybe 5 or 6, came through my lane just to buy the kid a tube of M&amp;MS minis. The kid put the candy and a coupon for a free tube on the belt. I thought it was cute that she was being a big girl and doing the transaction herself. I scanned the candy and the coupon, but the ""free"" coupon didn't take off sales tax, which came to a whopping two cents. When I asked the mom for the two pennies, you'd have thought I'd thrown acid in her face by the look she gave me. The slammed the pennies down, grabbed her kid, and left without another word. 

A few minutes later my supervisor (who spoke English as a second language) came over and asked ""why you no be nice to customer? You be nice to customer!"" I asked what I'd done, and she said the woman had complained about me asking her to pay the two cents. I asked if she would have preferred my drawer be short the two cents. Her response:""Be nice to customer!""

TL;DR: customer complains because I asked her to pay the sales tax she owed on a ""free"" item, my supervisor has no guidance for me on how to handle the situation. ","""Be nice to customer!""",57,talesFromRetail
ArQuesta,27,,20,1r3xmk,,49,"Hello again, fellow retail slaves. I've posted a few times before, but mostly about my time before college, when I worked at a Stop for Gamers. Not today. I meant to go get some reading done this evening, but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and I'm car-less at the moment, so I decided to tell you about a recent story.

I just got done with my Bachelor's this summer. I know, I should have escaped the abyss that is retail, but I'm stuck at home, saving up money to move to the D.C. area at the moment, while also filling out grad school applications, as well as working on big job applications. I'm in a stupid spot and I need money, so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a three-minute walk from home. Score.

For the most part the job is fine, no real horrible people to be found. The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping, so it's fine with me if they like being pricks. They just spent $6 on a f*cking drink. 

Anywho. Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness. I was working the drive-thru window, which, at night, meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot. During a rush there's two of us, as people's drinks go from normal to downright stupid-complicated. But, alas, there's always a button for it.

A nice, shiney $40k+ car pulls up, my last customer in a long line rush. She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chit-chat. Now, for some background, I have the worst baby face. I mean, it's great that I look young, but depending on the person my 28 years looks like 20. I don't wear make-up, drink, or smoke, so I am lacking any pre-wrinkles and I'm chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks. It's fine though, as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly. For this conversation I'll use BAC for the lady, and Me as me.

BAC: ""Oh, are you still in school right now?""

Me: ""Actually I just finished, I'm working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feet.""

BAC: ""Oh, what did you major in?""

Me: ""East-Asian studies."" *chuckles* ""It's kind of useless around here.""

BAC: ""Would you say that you could talk about your major confidently?""

Me: *at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college, or needs a strangely specific tutor* ""Oh, yeah, I can talk for days about culture, history, politics, language, etc for days.""

BAC: ""Have you ever read the bible?""


Me: *shitshitshitshit, here it comes* ""...Well, a bit when I was younger.""

BAC: *with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes* ""When I was in college, my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes, one where God existed and one where he doesn't. Sure, if you're in the box where he isn't there, fine, but what if you're in the other one? Is it really that harmful to believe?""


Now, at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers, and had tuned out the conversation, as she told me afterwards. I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me, but alas, I was trapped.


Me: *remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view, but deciding not to argue at work* ""Well, as a kid my dad let me try out every religion, and I've built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them. If I had to subscribe to anything--""

BAC: ""Some people are really fake, you know? They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area."" *suddenly angry* ""I know a lot of fake people, and they aren't people you should call friends.""

Me: *the fuk?*

This was the most annoying part...

BAC: *suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching* ""What are you going to do after you're done with school?""

Me: ""I dunno, work for the government?""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Take care of my parents and family.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Travel or work abroad.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""I've thought about adopting.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Live my life happily?""

BAC: ""What about after life?""

Me: ""There's nothing.""

BAC: *legitimately surprised* ""And you're okay with that?""

Me: ""Well, yeah, we're not immortal. You live to the best of your ability until you die.""

BAC: *changing tactics* ""When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson, really friendly, but it was fake. People are fake. Then I read the bible. There's something there, if you read it you'll understand.""

Me: ""Maybe one day I'll read it, but it's not--""

BAC: ""Well, you know, everyone has problems, right?""

Me: ""Of course.""

BAC: *surprised for some reason that I've agreed with her* ""Well, how do you deal with problems?""

Me: ""Sometimes slowly, sometimes not at all. I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people. You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again. Some people can't cope and need medications, but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their own.""

BAC: ""My husband used to be addicted to money, sex, and drugs.""


This is about where my patience absolutely ended, my face started to crack a grin. I'm not an arrogant person, but I write, I read, I study constantly. I'm an intelligent person, and I wasn't going to allow her to outwit or -speak me, but I was also trying to be unfailingly polite.


Me: *corners of my mouth twitching* ""Oh yeah?""

BAC: *conspiratorially* ""He used to be the biggest drug dealer in [my home town].""

Me: *holding in my amusement, badly* ""Really!""

BAC: ""Now he's the best husband, utterly faithful, and he read the bible. He's spiritual now, that's proof. You have to--""

And then, like God himself saying ""Jesus lady, shut up"" the drive-thru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel, I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian, and turned away from the window. As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions. My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened. I was a little mortified. I mean, here was this lady with a car worth more than my four-year education, lecturing a girl (lol) who she thought was in the middle of college (~20), working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a, what she thought, excellent education. If she only worked retail, than dear drug-dealing hubby must have paid for that, right? At what point did she have the right to say that I wasn't spiritual? I'm very spiritual, and I have my own views of spirituality. At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs, money, and sex? Not only that, did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the non-religious simply because I told her I was educated? 


Plus she didn't tip that poor drive-thru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool. Seriously.

Toni-Cipriani,3,,12,1rdgs7,,45,"Just a short and small story. I work in a small independent corner/liquor store. Anyways in the later hours of my very slow evening a man enters the store and since I was walking past the area where the door is I just said ""Hey what's up man? How are you?"" To no response and him practically looking through me.

Ahh well,  it happens so I go on about my business and about 4 minutes later after he finishes picking out some beer he steps over to the front counter. The look on his face when he noticed I stepped up behind the cash register (And the fact that I was the only person working in the store that night)  was pretty priceless, he turned a bit red and made sure to try and act somewhat chummy with me.

Him: Oh.... I'm sorry... I totally disregarded you.

Metroidzoid,4,,5,1refmp,,45,"So while it is [this woman's](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qvkqw/i_am_counting_the_days_until_she_leaves/) second-to-last day, I don't have to work with her on the same shift, so I was counting the hours until we no longer shared the same time clock. 

She made those minutes crawl by at an exhausting rate.

But I did two things that, in any normal circumstances, I might not be proud of.  But today, I regret nothing.  The first was near the end of the shift.  Because I needed to count one of the tills, I was vacuuming the front carpets, a task normally done while other cashiers counted cash.  So I started the task about 30 min. early, giving myself time to stop for customers coming up to the register, and for load-outs as well.

She's on her phone.  Again.  She's the damn primary cashier and she's just sitting there!  ON THE GODDAMN PHONE!  I stop what I'm doing, ring up the customer quickly, then bypass every carpet I had started on the far side of the counter, and just started vacuuming all around the gift-wrap table.  Last Day Woman was surprisingly resilient, and managed to keep a conversation the entire time while her voice was elevated enough that I think the loading dock heard it.

The second petty act was while all three off us were on the register.  Well, me and pleasant co-worker started, had the line pretty much under control, but Last Day addressed her own concerns first and dragged over a customer she had been helping (but who wasn't waiting in line) over to the third register.  I warned her that the til had been acting up since Friday, and did not except plastic.  ""Oh, no it's fine.  I've been running transactions all day""

""But those were cash, you can't us-""

""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING""

I left her to it.  In the mean time, the line grew longer.  And longer.  About the same time I hear a voice behind me saying ""I don't know why it's not working"", and then a tap on my shoulder as LD wants me to get off my register so she can ring up her friend.  I could not help but smirk slightly as I told her that I was ringing up people who were already in line, and she would have to wait.

Please for the love of everything don't let this woman extend her 'two-ish weeks'.  What gods have I slighted to die in such company?","I am a petty, petty man, and I hold no regrets",50,talesFromRetail
Sasparillafizz,22,,33,1r3ozm,,45,"Not a great story, but was so ""Your joking, right?"" I felt I could post it so others could share in my bafflement.

Got a phone call earlier today at (Insert specialty gaming store here.) 

Our phone call customer, we'll use PG for Phone guy, called regarding his Xbox1 reserve.

Now, for the pre-orders for the console, we took a down payment as a deposit for the console to make sure you are actually going to pick it up. Otherwise everyone and their grandma would try to 'reserve' on of the new consoles and only a fraction of them would have the money/time/etc to pick it up at launch. These deposits are of course fully refundable if you change your mind. Or if you go buy it from a competitor, ebay, etc. 

Reserved items are held for 48 hours, we will absolutely guarantee it remain in stock that long for you if you preorder. We aren't going to hold it a week, a month, or longer; sitting around collecting dust and shooing away customers who want to purchase the item you can't be bothered to pick up because you put down a 20% deposit months ago. This is ESPECIALLY true with systems and collectors sets, which we hold VERY FIRMLY to the 48 hour rule.

Onto the story!

PG: ""I had a question about the Xbox 1 I had reserved.""

Sasparilla: ""Go ahead?""

PG: ""Well see, I have a bit of a family emergency, and won't be able to pick up the Xbox until tuesday and-""

At this point I cut him off, having done this conversation so. many. times. this day alone; let alone the last week. ""Regretfully sir, the consoles can only be held till 6pm on Saturday. If you don't pick it up Saturday night, it will go on sale on sunday to the first buyer.""

PG is PISSED. ""What do you mean you'll sell it? I paid for it!""

Sasparilla: ""You placed a deposit on the item in question to have it set aside for you. If you do not pick it up within the hold period, we cannot guarantee we will have it in stock when you come to pick it up.""

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!""

Sasparilla: ""How so?""

PG: ""Your supposed to hold it 48 hours! It comes out friday.""

Ah, I see the problem. Not the original problem addressed, but the bone he is currently chewing on. ""We are starting the pre-ring process at 6PM on Thursday. The consoles will be paid for and purchased, but they won't be handed over the counter until midnight. Its to preven-"" 

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!"" 

Ah. A street savvy lawyer here. Sasparilla: ""We can, and are, Sir. We can ring up the products early, the steet date only prevents us from handing the product to customers early to get an advantage over competitors. No matter where you go, you will not get your hands on a Xbox one before midnight. But we can make the purchase any time we please.

PG: ""You can't do that!""

Sasparilla: ""We can, and are sir. Microsoft has never had a problem with us doing this for any of their products in the past. Since the items are being sold at 6PM Thurs, you have 48 hours to pick it up."" 

PG: ""Well I cant get there till Tues."" 

Sasparilla: ""Then your console will be sold on Saturday after six. You ca-""

PG: ""You can't do that! We had a CONTRACT.""

Note to any armchair lawyers, we do not. A deposit is not a purchase of the product, merely that he has offered the payment ahead of the time of exchange. The terms of this are clearly spelled out, and his offer is refundable at any time if an agreement (payment at price at time of purchase) is not made.  

Sasparilla: ""Sir, our terms are very clearly explained. If you do not show up for your purchase it will be sold. There is very high demand for the Xbox 1, we cannot hold it for you till Tues. At best, I can hold it to the end of saturday night.""

PG: ""You said you have to hold it 48 hours!""

Sasparilla: ""We are. From opening Friday, to closing saturday."" 

PG: ""Thats not 48 hours!""

...

Your kidding right? Your killing me here.

Sasparilla: ""From open to close Friday. And open to close saturday. Each day is 24 hours apart. This adds up to 48 hours. We can hold your console till then.""

PG: ""Well I can't make it till tues!""

Sasparilla (silently) /to f-ing bad?/

Sasparilla: ""Do you have someone who could pick it up for you?""

PG: ""I dunno, my friend could."" 

Sasparilla: ""If you pay for the console in full and provide him with the receipt, he can come in before Sat and pick up your console for you. I'll even make a note on the account that another person will pick it up for you with the receipt.""

PG: ""Fine. You better have my damn console for me. I gotta go visit my aunt in the hospital! I shouldn't be punished for this!""

verynotberry,14,,8,1r0rm7,,42,"I've been out of retail for several years, but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia.  I worked in a store in a smaller town, where you aren't always slammed and get to know your customers.  There was one family I'll always remember with fondness.  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it. I looked forward to their visits. These were truly kind, wonderful people.

However, there were also the jerks.  The guy I'm going to tell you about is one of those.  Now, normally when someone would be a jerk to me, I would tend to write it off.  It's not personal, I'm not verynotberry, I'm the cashier.  If it happened every time they came in to the store, that was another story.  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers.  Talked down to us, treated us like idiots, the lot.  But one day, one glorious day, I got my petty revenge.

He came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases.  While counting the change, I noticed a Canadian penny.  This store was in the U.S.  So . . . not legal tender.  I tell coin man, CM, for short that I can't accept his penny.

CM:  What?  Why not?

Me:  Well, it's not legal tender.  

CM:  Why not? 

Me:  Well, this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada, so I cannot accept this.

&lt;bear in mind, I'm smiling and as friendly as I could possibly be&gt;

CM:  What?  That's bull----.  Just take the d--n penny!   (Truly, he was a gifted debater.)

Me:  Well, sir, I would, but outside the boundaries of Canada, this is not legal tender, so I cannot accept this.

CM:  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE!  

&lt;Because I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins, don't you?&gt;

Me:  Sir, if that is true, I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them, but as it stands, I will need an American penny.

(It's important to note that throughout this entire process, he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars' worth of coins.)

CM:  Oh Jesus.  Fine.

He throws a penny on the counter.  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest, kindest, most customer-friendly smile.

Me:  Thank you so much, sir.  Please have a nice day.

Now, if this had been any of our other customers, I would have taken the penny no questions asked because, hey, the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly, so it's easy to miss.  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny, but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel small.

It felt amazing!

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,9,1rhw8z,,58,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Mystic-Spiral,3,,9,1rfdiq,,43,"Greetings fellow retail workers, happy Thanksgiving! 

While we all wait for Thursday/Friday this week I think it would be good for us all to focus on the positive. We have all had them, the customers that make us laugh, smile, or say the inappropriate thing that we ourselves were thinking but couldn't say out loud. 

One of my favorite stories takes place on a Sunday. I'm not sure what it is, but Sundays are awful. No matter where I have worked Sunday has brought out the mean demanding, and crazy customers.

This Sunday was no different. I was working open to close and everyone was as pissy and demanding as possible. I was exhausted and flying on autopilot when a middle aged woman approached my counter to pay for a few items. 

The items she had chosen were final sale pieces. Even though these items say final say in red on the tag I will always remind customers that these pieces can not be returned or exchanged (which of course people try to do at least once a week).  

So I greet this fabulous lady and begin to ring up her selection. I launch into my usual spiel.
""Now these are final sale pieces which means they can't come back or be exchanged.""

Cue the customer throwing her arms up towards the heavens and proclaiming in a loud voice ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T BRING BACK THIS FIVE DOLLER SHIRT? WHATEVER WILL I DO?! OH NO, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL LIVE WITH KNOWING I CAN NOT RETURN THIS!""

I'll admit, at first I thought she was serious and was bracing myself for the onslaught, because that had been my whole day up til that point. 

Then a beautiful thing happened. She put her arms down, smiled at me, winked and said ""I think I will survive paying five dollars for a shirt and not being able to return it.""

I blinked as I processed what had just happened and then I just lost it. I laughed so hard! I rang her up and while still giggling informed her that she had just made my day and won my coveted favorite customer if the day award. She laughed. I laughed. My Sunday got a little better.

partinobodycular,22,,11,1r701h,,43,"I'm an assistant manager at a shoe store with a free rewards program. You get 10 points for every dollar you spend, and every 1500 points gets you a $10 off certificate. One of my associates, A, had just signed up a customer who was leaving the country the next day and I guess wanted to take shoes for everyone back home. The customer ended up spending about $800. Normally, the points are added to the account when we close the registers at the end of the day, and it can take a couple of weeks to actually see your certificate. But since this girl was leaving, I did some quick math and gave her $50 off. After she left, I pulled A aside to show her how to fill out a points adjustment form so we could email customer service and say, ""Hey, we already honored a bunch of these points, so you can deduct them."" A is fairly new - I think she started in September? She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now. Most of the time.

Part of the form is to explain how many points need to be added/deducted, and why, so I asked out loud how many points would get you $50 off. I could have figured it out in my head, but hey, ~~this was a teaching moment~~ I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldn't have to. Turns out, she didn't know how many points it takes to get a certificate. Okay... this is kind of Rewards 101. I ask a few more questions to see what she *does* know. Turns out, she also doesn't know details about how points are earned. This is really basic stuff. Any customer could ask her these questions at any time. So I give her a quick rundown, and then toss an easy one her way.

""How many dollars do you have to spend to get 1500 points?"" She doesn't know. I'm getting frustrated, so I grab some paper and write it down, thinking that'll help her see how simple it is. 10 points per dollar, how many dollars for 1500 points? All you have to do is divide 1500 by 10, but A can't do it. She's starting to get a blank look, and I realize I need to back off; I believe she has the capability to solve this question, but she's shutting down. I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know, and let her go.

A few minutes later, it's time for A's fifteen, so I look around to see where she's gone to. I don't see her on the floor. I'm starting to get a bad feeling. I ask her friend, C, if she knows where A is, and C says she's in the bathroom. Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature. I started worrying that I had been too harsh, and that A was now crying in the bathroom. I'd never made an associate cry before. I watch for A to come back out onto the floor, and the longer I wait, the worse I'm feeling. Finally I see her come out, and she looks composed. I wait a minute to give her some space - I don't want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out - and then head over to see if she's okay and tell her to go on her fifteen. She says she's already gone, so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down. Fair enough, though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break. She mentions that she felt too much pressure, and then says that B, the main cashier, had laughed at her. This is kind of unsurprising, B is one of our biggest troublemakers. I have plenty of other stories to tell about B, but I'll save them for another night.

malnormalish,19,,7,1r9oo9,,40,"So I work at an art craft store and we sell these crazily popular rubber band bracelet looms  along with rubber band refill packs. They come in a multitude of colors but we usually only have 3-4 colors at a time. Every day I have people coming up asking if we have any other colors, which is a valid question. I tell them that no, what we have out is all that there is, and then half of the time they ask, ""Are you sure?""  No, I'm not sure, I'm just pulling that out of my ass...


When I tell them yes, I'm definitely sure, I've seen more people than I would have guessed throw tantrums. I've gotten people asking if I could just double check in the back (No, nothing in the back) and even had a couple people offer me extra cash on the side if I could give them a certain color, trying to bribe me. I don't understand what they want me to do, it's not like I can magically summon the rubber bands out of thin air.


It's absolutely crazy how these people act trying to get these looms. Seriously, we have sold 230 of them in one night. That same night, for the last loom available, I taped a note on it saying ""I'm the LAST one"" and about ten minutes later saw two ladies walk up to it at the same time. It was like a showdown in a movie. They glared at each other before one lady just quickly grabbed it and walked away. The other lady then complained to me about how we should have had more of them, to check when they'll be in (we don't know), yadda yadda.


A couple annoying things to note about this product is that we have moved the display for it from about the middle of the store to quite literally the frontmost center of the store, standing there right as the customers walk in. These customers have to walk past the display directly to my counter where they ask me where the product is. I usually just point and they follow my dead-eyed stare to the display behind them. Then the customer will walk over, pluck one from the shelf, ignoring the neon-colored, bolded signs printed on 8x12 pieces of foamboard stating that no coupons are to be accepted on the looms. The customer then promptly whips out a coupon. When I then tell them I cannot use said coupon, most of them are annoyed but okay, while others tell me it's bullshit and storm out threatening to never come back to the store again,  saying that ""The coupon is the only reason I came!"". 



Of course all of you know that people do not read and refuse to even attempt to observe their surroundings, blaming poor cashiers for problems out of their control, so my tale should not come as a surprise. 


So to end this rant I just wanted to ask what products sold at your place of work give you the most frustration. This loom kit has been probably the worst to deal with for me. I see people get insanely angry about these things-- it's sort of funny but also very horribly frustrating.

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching cause' they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left. The other sales person still got the sale etc, but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her, still want my 2500 back though.",Is that stealing?,44,talesFromRetail

Many many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier. This supermarket was in a large shopping centre. Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was 33 years ago. Wow! Time has flown! 

This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt. Bomb threats had been made to various stores. We, the staff, thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work. The alarm would go off, we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time, we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again. 

We were having a bomb scare every couple of days. All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened. 

Then, in the space of nine days three stores were bombed. The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve. The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest. 

Cue this story. Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert. A lady comes up to my check out. Two carts of frozen goods. Chickens, 4 litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine. I start putting the order through. Keep in mind this was back in the dim, dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from. No scanners back then. I was slaving away, making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off. 

By this time we all knew the drill precisely. Pull the cash draw, throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately. We did not muck around any more! So, with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit, I pull the draw and prepare to exit. 

'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?' I hear screamed at me. My customer with all the frozen goods. 

I turn to her and say 'Would you please exit the store immediately. It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent events.'

She is having none of it. 'What about all my food. Only part of it is rung up and I need it. You have to finish my order. It will only take 5 or 10 minutes.'

With thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say, 'Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta here!!'

Thankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time. I jump on the train and head 1. 5 hours west. Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home (it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked) as they were having a bomb scare as well!! Total of two bomb scares in one day for me!

I heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store. As for that ladies '5 or 10 minutes'? They received only a 10 minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve. They managed to evacuate over 2000 people before it went off. No one got hurt. They have never charged anyone over the event. I left the job shortly after. This kind of ruined my taste for working check out. 

TL;DR Ice cream and bombs don't go together. Just ask my customer.

BraveSouls,10,,10,1rfyes,,35,"**Some background:** I work for a privately owned consignment shop. For those that don't know, it's a second-hand shop (though we also sell new items), but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them. We take the items in and once they sell, we get a commission off the sale, and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month. We sell both in store and on eBay.  

[](/spacer)

This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter. She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it. I smile thinking that's very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter. The greater majority of our big furniture is right in the middle of the store when she walks in so she looks around while I go back to my laptop to continue working on an eBay listing.  
[](/spacer)      
[](/spacer)  
She asked me random questions here and there about the different items then finds her way to the back where we have a large screen TV for sale. She calls my attention and the conversation went something like this:

**Old Lady:** How much for the TV?

**Me:** $30

**OL:** Okay I'll probably take it. Does it come with a remote?  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)

My boss, who was processing item drop offs, overheard and said there wasn't one with the TV but we had a separate remote next to it. It was one of those big button universal remotes that likes to think bigger is better (Note: I know why they're really that size). At this point she told me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it. I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her I'd be right back and to feel free to look around more.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
I noted the brand of the TV (can't remember what it was) and went to my laptop with the remote. I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didn't have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV. I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it. I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better. The whole process took about 20 minutes, including the other questions she had about stuff in the store. She was very grateful and purchased the TV, remote, and a wall plaque.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The next trick was getting the TV into her car. This wasn't a flat screen. It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie. It was also very heavy. So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car. Silly him doesn't have a dolly so I'm looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements. I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little. I'm worried it won't fit but he is unfazed. He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space. Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV. He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didn't want to come back inside.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
**OL:** So now what?

**Me:** I'll just get your name and number and we'll put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it up.

**OL:** Okay, but what about my money?

**Me:** Huh? (Thinking *'uh oh'*)

**OL:** Can I get my money back? I don't know if I'll have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get home.

**Me:** Well, we certainly will hold the TV for you until you're ready to pick it up since you've already paid for it. We won't be able to hold it for your otherwise. (It's worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV. But as it was only $30 and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items, he doesn't allow deposits for items anymore.)

**OL:** I know, but I'm worried about getting it out of my car. Can I just get my money back?

**Me:** *'Oh boy.'* I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this.  
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
The shop has a no returns policy. My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if it'll work or not but he's otherwise firm against returns. This is due to the nature of the business. Someone pays for a consigned item, we send a sale check out to the consignor, then that person decides to try to return it afterward isn't exactly good for business. Either way, I couldn't give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story. He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant, yet still nice about it, so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote. She didn't ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldn't have anyway. She thanks us and leaves.   
[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  
We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation. At the very least we didn't have to move the TV. It's still sitting in the shop looking for a home. Poor thing.

So I go to my gallery and...huh? There's a video in my download file? That's weird, because I have never downloaded a video in my life on my phone (I probably wouldn't even know how to do so). I click it and...BAM! A whopping 17 minutes of gay porn. Wow, okay, so THAT'S something my adolescent eyes didn't want to see. I immediately start trying to think of where and HOW this video could have gotten downloaded on my phone when...wait, this video was uploaded last Saturday at 4:40 pm? That's weird, I worked an 11-7 shift last Saturday, which I remember pretty clearly because it took up my entire afternoon. So the next step is to go check my internet history and..wow, how WEIRD. The only internet history I have is from two separate dates, 11/22 (from last night when I was trying to look up something for a friend), and 11/19, when I was looking up someone's address because I needed it for my National Guard papers. I've used the internet a lot in the past six months I have my phone, and I've never deleted my internet history before, so...huh. It seems to me like somebody went on the internet, found a gay porn, downloaded it on my phone, and deleted my internet history so I wouldn't find out. Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed. I like to think I'm a well liked employee, especially by the managers, but I know some people don't like me because I'm 17 and receiving training to become a manager, even though I've only worked there for six months while other people have been there for years without a promotion. The video source seems like it comes from the internet rather than a text message, and even then, I would never download a multimedia file from someone I don't know, and I haven't received any texts like that, ever. So yeah. I'm probably going to talk to the store manager about possible sexual harassment even though it's going to be hard to find out who did it, and I'm probably only going to take about $5 with me to work at all times because if someone is going to go into my purse and download porn onto my phone, who knows what else they might do?

Takeabyte,8,,8,1r3uuj,,34,"The former VP of a computer company's retail division had a lot of policies that were intended to improve the customer experience. He was a strong believer that we sales people could deter thieves simply by talking to them and that having security measures like empty boxes of software, door alarms, and fake products were nothing but an annoyance to customers and would ruin the vibe.

Shout out to /r/JealousyGrey and his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r24y4/they_do_know_theyre_fake_right/) that reminded me of this gem...

The worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves. I worked in a much smaller store than most, the shelves were only about 20 feet away from the door. At any given time, there would be $50,000 to $100,000 worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had. Everything ranging from the full version of design software, productivity software, portable hard drives, headphones, etc. Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe. Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard. Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate (like a grocery store) so we were required to put products where they told us to put them. For example, when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space, we'd have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display. It was madness. Over the years though, they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took over..

The worst for us was a video editing program. It cost $1,299 and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets, but it also made it way easier to grab and run with. Anyway, a box of that would go missing *every week!* It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell! We'd look over, notice it was missing, ask everyone working, usually only 5 or 6 of us including one technician and one manager (it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once) anyway, we'd ask everyone if they sold it, and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it. We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf instead.

So, life goes on and time passes. The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again. Meanwhile, a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up. One time, I was playing billiards in their garage and there's this one guy who was there because he was a [kleptomaniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store... I couldn't believe it. I was playing pool with the guy that stole about $20,000 worth of software. He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair. People almost got fired for that shit! It was crazy. I wanted to punch the guy in the face!

Oh well, he did go to jail for a couple years and [I whooped his butt at pool](http://i.imgur.com/QqHzZ.gif). He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things. Looking back at it now, it obviously didn't effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gear.

**TL;DR**: Someone stole a *lot* of software from the store. I met him years later and beat him... at playing pool.

I have *soooo* many other stories from working that store for so long, I'll tell you guys some more later. For now I'll just wish you a safe holiday season, stay strong, and eat a breakfast.

meguriau,19,,14,1refgz,,33,"Hi TFR! Today's [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens. I was really happy with myself but don't have any coworkers to share the moment with! Here goes (: 

 **Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

The weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day, overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain. As a store specialising in hats, this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers. On quiet days like these, I typically wind up 'gardening': this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but, rather, a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave. It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first. Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be, flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike. As a completionist, the process invokes feelings of frustration, rage and self-pity. 

After this ordeal, I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break. This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance, is quite elevated so that people can't peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need be.

One bite into a delicious banana muffin (baked by my mother), the sensor by the door went off. I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water, emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple, poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares. Let's call the man DHS for designer hat snob. DHS and wife, it so seemed, had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option. Pet peeve #1. Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation. He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointment.

**HB:** EXCUSE ME. YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATS.

The brand does stock men's hats. In fact, there is a display window showcasing the more popular men's styles which he had clearly missed. In some ways, it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately. Unfortunately, this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly **male** models wearing similar hats in the backdrop, some of them topless for good measure. Pet peeve #2.

**M:** We do stock men's hats. They're just up the back, near the counter and to your right.

This appeared to pique his interest. Without so much a thank you, DHS and wife scuttled over to the men's section. Pet peeve #3. I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing inside.

DHS rams the nearest ivory-white $325 panama hat on his head.

**DHS:** It's too small.

**M:** The men's panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yo-

**DHS:** -grunt-

I continued to give him the best smile I could muster. Pet peeve #4.

DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips out.

**DHS:** Ridiculous! This is more expensive than a Borsalino! (For those of you that are unaware, Borsalino is a Italian-made designer hat brand)

He stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount. To be completely honest, I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry (but of course, I wasn't going to let my ignorance be known). Knowing I wouldn't get a sale from him anyway, I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile. Without anything to argue against, the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance. 

I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin. it tasted like victory. I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face. 

Later during the day, I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats. My findings were interesting. For his statement to be true, there were two possiblities.

1. Yes, the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats. However, the hat he was referring to was a papier hat (‚Ç¨154 or about AUD $230), basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm. The panama hats Borsalino sold were in the ‚Ç¨280+ range (~AUD $420+)

2. Currency conversion means nothing to him and, therefore ‚Ç¨280 = AUD $280.

DrChiefChef,10,,9,1r31cw,,34,"This tale (also my first) comes from a land of happiness and joy, right? no? okay I lied it comes from the place where Dreams go to Die. 

Ever since I was younger I always wanted to work at this theme park here in Florida, I mean I always thought it would be so cool, so when the acceptance into working for this company came I jumped on it. I've been here since May and when I thought I would be working in a kitchen or something related to my major of Culinary Arts, I was wrong. 

I currently work at one of those Popcorn and Ice cream wagons you typically see in theme parks and normally I can get through a day just because I love the people I work WITH. This is not the case of last Monday.

(technically this is retail related cause I do sell some merchandise things)

Mondays shift was from 5:45pm to 12:15am so overall not too bad. I was put at a cart that most wagons close With or Around Park closing time so I was pretty confident that I wasn't closing anything (Closing is a bitch to do when you have closed 90 percent of every week that you work, especially popcorn wagons) I get in and see my name on the closing list as closing Popcorn 1, at this point my heart sinks because that means I wont be getting out of here till at least 1am. 

The day goes by alright, until about 10:00pm (wagon closes at 10:30 for some weird reason when park is open till 12)
Here are a few minor things that just built up

* People decided that it was okay to throw money at me when paying for something
* When I ask how someones day is at least say okay or good don't ignore that I asked and just start with your order, believe it or not I do care how your day is going
* A guy came up and cut my line during the middle of a transaction with another guest and asks what happens if he dropped his frozen lemonade, well normally we would just give him a new one but since I had a hunch he was straight up lying to me I asked some questions; such as Where he dropped it (he wasn't too sure where they were) and how long ago he bought it and where (like 20 minutes ago and from this cart but not from me; huh thats funny I've been here the WHOLE DAY no break for me yet) and he said he ""thinks that their were three that dropped on the ground"" I told him without the carton or lid or some proof I could not just replace 3 free lemonades. 

(Note: I didn't even call the managers because I knew that they would just give in and give him the 3 free, I really didn't care at that point though)

And the grand prize of my shitty night ended at 10 minutes before closing. This lady comes up too my wagon and wants to buy two 12 dollar popcorn souvenir buckets so I go and grab them and start to fill them while she fishes out her card (more efficient this way, not practical I know) 

So I come back after filling these buckets and she's trying to pay with this feature that the theme park has for resort guests that is on their wrists. well it wasn't accepting her pin so I asked for her back-up which is an actual card that  they are given at check in and told to keep with them at all times because they are still beta testing the wristbands. she is all annoyed because apparently our 3 button wasn't working to enter her pin with (funny been working all day lady!) and so her husband decides he's just going to pay cash and I tell him the total. 

In the middle of me saying your total is 24 dollars the woman interrupts with ""you do have bags for these right?"" (No we don't we are a popcorn stand, we do provide handles for you to carry them with and they have lids) I tell her ""no unfortunately we don't but if you turn around and go to them they do""(literally its maybe 5 steps away there is a cart that sells merchandise stuff that has bags)  In the middle of that statement the crazy old bitch says ""are you fucking kidding me"" I just stare at her at this point she keeps rambling on about how ""fucking pissed she is that I don't have any fucking bags"" and that since I don't have any bags she will not be buying them, knocks one of them on the ground and walks away.

JeebusClyste,19,,14,1r9uxu,,29,"   A little background: I work on a golf course at a nice country club in my area. We have some stellar employees and some who can be a pain in the rear. This story is about the latter. 
   So to start things off, it's important to know that 95% of the employees on the golf course dip (if unfamiliar, it's like chewing tobacco, but you don't chew it, you just let it sit in your lip.) I've never had a problem with giving a dip to a friend if they've run dry, but one employee NEVER has his own supply, and it's quite annoying to feed his addiction. To make matters worse, he has gotten to where he just takes pinches from my can of Copenhagen without asking me (I don't keep my can in my pocket because it can get uncomfortable at times). If you're a dipper, you know what a pain that can be.
   After multiple attempts of telling him to cut that out, he still continues his thievery. So I devised a simple, yet effective plan. I brought two cans of dip to work: one empty and one full of sweet tobacco. Whenever I would finish a dip, I'd put it in the empty can instead of throwing it in the trash. Eventually, the empty can filled up with nice, already used dip. So I left it out where the employee (I'll call him Bob) could see it. 
   I noticed Bob had a nice fat dip in his lip. I checked, and sure enough, the can filled with my saliva tainted dip was about half empty. He'd been using it. Marvelous. 
I asked him how his dip was. 

""It tastes different man, it's less bold than it usually is.""

To which I replied: ""oh yea? That's because that can was full of re-dips. So you basically just had my mouth in yours.""

""Dude that's so nasty!"" Replied Bob. 

""I told you not to take my dip.""

He was chalk white. I thought he was going to throw up. Maybe that'll teach him to buy his own dip, and stop stealing out of my can.

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

Toni-Cipriani,11,,7,1r6mbw,,30,"This isn't so much a tale as it is something I've been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent 

I work for a small independent corner/liquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the area.

I have worked for retail chains too, namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain.  

Some pros I've been noticing are that working for an independent store:

-Much more laid back on certain things, have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please. Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have ""tabs"" when they are short on money

-Smaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful. 

-I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond, but it's more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers. Don't have to worry about things like returns, etc

-I  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop. 

-I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeks.


A few cons I've picked up on:




-The owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every 2 days pretty much

-No benefits like health coverage or anything

-No holidays off, only 4 people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stone.

-Realistically speaking I probably have alot less job security,  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel I'm well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly. 

My work doesn't have things like ""write ups"" it's what the owner wants at the end of the day. 

-This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop, but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have. I'd probably have to either ignore it or leave, people close to the owner are essentially untouchable I'd imagine.

 Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope. ",Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain?,37,talesFromRetail

Gimick,8,,11,1r0n8k,,28,"I work at an office/warehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving. We are technically a distributor, so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases, but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture, we also answer calls about defective merchandise. 

In the industry I work in, almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we make/distribute. We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise, where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund. Fine. It's no big deal, we usually just replace it. 

I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product. I go through the motions to make sure it's not just some kind of user error, and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem. She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new one.

I ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address. Well, naturally I have to ask about it. It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well. It is odd, but not unheard of, so I let it go.

After I get the information I need to process the replacement order, I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product. At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two. Hmm.

I assume she meant her daughters order, and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order, and that both would arrive on the same day. She corrected me, telling me that is not what she meant.

She then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with. I try to figure out why, which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she bought.

I repeatedly try to get her back on track, as I would rather not dally on the phone all day. Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves two.

Apparently instead of calling when her item broke, she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item. It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement, but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item. That is speculation, of course.

Either way, she felt since she bought a second item (which works perfectly, according to her), I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new, less expensive one. 

I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people, but to me, the math is off. Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her, as she purchased the item through a retailer, we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situation.

Am I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base? Is this sort of compensation common in other industries?

I work at a big-box retail store, specifically in the Electronics and Wireless phones department. And while there are stories galore I can talk about (and I may in the future), there is one I need to tell you all about now. This one customer used to come in on a regular basis and shop, then scream and yell at employees claiming that they are stealing from her and cheating her. Mind you, the police have been called in on a few occasions and have even had to subdue her on at least one occasion for trying to start a fight. This becomes even funnier when you know what she looks like: early 60's and about 5' tall: the small spitfire type. 

Anyways, during the past year she has come in and not started a screaming match with my management team, but her store visits have gotten, in the words of Alice, ""curiouser and curiouser"". The last time she came in I was resetting our new release DVD shelving to make way for the next day's releases with my co-worker ""Josie"". In comes the customer and stands 10 feet away from me and ""Josie"". She calls to us: ""Excuse, please; you help me? Now? Now?"" I look over to her, mutter a few choice words under my breath, and ask ""who, me?"" ""Yes, yes. Come, quickly..."" So I get up, say a little prayer, and come over.

ME: Sure! What did you need?

HER: Are you sure I can ask? (Motions over to ""Josie"") Can she hear us?

HER: Are you sure? You sure you no crazy people?

ME: No; I'm not crazy, she's not crazy.

HER: Oh. OK. Here's my question...

And proceeds to ask me the same question about her phone for the next half hour; I answer in every way possible besides making puppets and acting it out, and eventually getting her phone company's tech support on the line to help me out. After she grabbed the phone from my hand and began gabbering on and on to the guy on the phone, she left; not really happy about the answer she got. When I picked the phone back up, the guy on the other end sounded like he needed a cigarette break and told me in no uncertain terms that I was correct in my explanation and that, if she doesn't heed our advice, she may get a disconnection notice very soon because she didn't listen.

She used to work with part time crew (so basically the college/h.s. kids, some of them being underaged) &amp; she would pick up random stuff in the store &amp; tell the guys how it could be a sex toy. For example she picked up a flyswatter, said it's the Texas Flyswatter, pretended to slap one of the guys in the ass &amp; said ""What's your number?"" She wasn't allowed to work with us after that &amp; eventually got fired.


This one lady was straight up disgusting. She was in her late 20s, early 30s &amp; looked like she was 16. I'm not 100% sure if she was on drugs, but overall she looked pretty cracked out. She always started drama. For instance, one time she wanted other employees fired so she smeared her shit on the bathroom wall &amp; tried to blame it on other employees. Apparently her plumbing stopped working in their apartment so they shit in buckets &amp; poured it on the floor when she &amp; her family got evicted. Her kid was always sick. When she got fired from the thrift store she got hired at the local bakery...



There was a creepy man that was known as the ""shoeman"" because he handled the shoes. He was missing teeth &amp; always hit on all the women that worked there. He always made me uncomfortable. He would be hammered while on the clock half the time. I remember when we added a charity to our store, people from the charity came and had a little party to promote their charity. The shoeman was pretty wasted and shouted stuff at the heads of the charity during their presentation. He eventually got fired &amp; arrested for stealing from the woman who smeared shit on the wall's purse.
There was a lot of drugged out people in general. People coked out &amp; pill poppin like crazy. One lady used to smash a 40 oz on her break in her car &amp; do lines off her steering wheel. Another lady, who worked there for like a week, used to ask the employees if they were drug addicts. She used to be like, ""I love drugs: coke, PCP, oxycotton, you name it."" 


One lady just topped them all. We called her Crazy Cari. She was in her 40s &amp; worked with all the high school//college kids part time. She didn't do shit, I hated her on busy days. But she was pretty batshit insane. She used to come into work fucked up all the time. Our manager lived in the same apartment complex as her dealer I guess. Crazy Cari would look in her windows for her when she was all fucked up. She once came into work and was like ""I took a Xanax bar &amp; I just drank an energy drink to reverse it."" She used to just walk up and down the aisles looking confused, barely cleaning up. We called her ""Peanut"" in the beginning because we found her hiding in the production room of the store eating peanuts. Her first week, she fell asleep in a rocking chair that was on the sales floor towards the end of her shift. I couldn't comprehend why the kept her besides entertainment purposes because she was so crazy. She used to talk to the high school girls about how beautiful ballsacks were and she confided in one of the girls that the shoeman came over to her apartment and basically raped her. One of our supervisors wouldn't schedule her a lot because she would always slack off. Crazy Cari would come in &amp; yell at her saying all this random shit like ""My mom's gonna die &amp; I'm alone."" We met her mom, she was fine. She was never alone when she came to visit, she always had gross looking drugged out men with her. We brought this to the attention of the manager because she was threatening towards to the supervisor &amp; employees. He ignored us. She eventually got fired...for firing a gun at the stuffed animals.

believeinsherlock,5,,4,1re3dl,,26,"So I guess I just need to get a bit off my chest and also because I thought I'd share what I have to deal almost every week. Sorry if this is worded weird, I'm not the best story teller. 

I work in a printing store. It's also a small store so we don't have many staff members. 

There are two people who come in who always create a ruckus, take up a bunch of space while ordering their prints, and generally become an annoyance. When they pick up their prints, they will show us old emails or old print outs of promotions and expect us to give it to them for that price. They have done this to ever single employee in the store as well. 

Today, they came in to order some products. There was one that was on sale a week ago, but the sale ended. After ordering it, (actually submitting the order through so it makes it a hassle to cancel) they came up to me and said that the total was too expensive. Not to ask about the price or anything, just to tell me it was **too expensive** and it was cheaper last month, and to give them the price from last month. When I told them that was not possible since the sale was over, they insisted on showing me the email saying it was discounted. When I pointed out the ""ends on"" date, they insisted that the manager said that they could have the price. 

I have a really great manager who doesn't mind us calling them if we need help on the weekends. So I do, and I explain the situation. They said no, and also that they had to pick up their order today that they had previously ordered. 

I'm not sure where else to add it, but I'll tell the story of the nicknamed ""promotion order"" now. We had a promotion going on for a certain size of product. They ordered a bunch of the wrong size, and then said that they made a mistake. When they ordered it, I had gone up to them a couple times to tell them what the promotion was for, and how to change the sizes to the right one. They dismissed me (rudely, might I add) every single time, telling me they knew what size they were getting. So when it comes time to pick up, they tell me that they picked the wrong size and it was my fault because I should have told them. Then they demanded they get the prioducts for that price because it was smaller than what the promotion was for Sorry bud, doesn't work that way. 

So back to today, I tell them that they need to pick up all their products today. It's been a few weeks. So I ring it through, and again I get a giant hissy fit in my face. They're screaming when there's a bunch of other customers in the store that it's not fair and basically insinuating that it's our fault they can't afford everything. Then they also started yelling at us because they had forgotten something of theirs in the store, we could not find it, so we should reimburse them. (It's not our fault you forgot something *two weeks* ago and now it's gone missing.) After my co-worker calmed them down, they went back to ordering more products. That they would probably not pay for. ",The reoccurring nightmare customers.,30,talesFromRetail

The previous customer is waiting for her friend in the restrooms, and she walks back by me on her way out the door.

ixiduffixi,4,,3,1r5xvj,,24,"So I was reading through another user's lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own. 

In my teenage years, my first job was working for the ""blue vest mafia."" My job description was something along the lines of ""Customer Service Specialist,"" which amounted to cart pusher, cashier, stockman, and basic maintenance. Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader. This tale involves one of those nights. 

When I worked on unloading my shift started at 3 p.m. We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse. The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver, and driven around the building to the warehouse. There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside. The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrance's sidewalk. This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door. This most commonly took place during store hours. (Not all of them are 24hrs.) Any way on to the story.

One day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock. This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour. Then the forktruck didn't return. I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse. When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight. I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off. The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone. I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer. They had apparently been talking for quite some time, because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office. When I asked what happened, my coworker got very, very upset. To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area. 

What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down. The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance. Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it. I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hours.

**BONUS STORY**

Another tale of the blue vest mafia. 

One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink, giggling, while his friend was in the stall also giggling. I took my time using the restroom, waiting them out, which eventually worked. While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something. 

After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies, sinus medication, and dvds. I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras. The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didn't stop until they were well outside. We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids.

ScaldingSoup,5,,5,1rha57,,27,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

When I got to work, I was able to see a line of 15 people waiting outside the front door. By the time we were able to open the front door (30 mins later), a crowd of 50-70 people ran through the front doors. I wasn't able to get to the safety gap fast enough, so instead I had to run from the crowd to a safely open area to avoid being trampled.

I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

dichotomies,9,,29,1r2lgs,,18,"Here‚Äôs a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank (not BoA). It happened several years ago. 


The story starts about a week prior in a dream. I rarely remember my dreams, but this one stuck out to me. I remembered many details, from how things were said, and the feelings expressed. I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream; it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up. 


Fast forward to ‚Äútoday.‚Äù I sit down and help a 20 something customer (‚ÄúJohn‚Äù) who is sorting out his dad‚Äôs accounts. John‚Äôs dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas. A semi plowed into him. As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it. But, moving on. We have paperwork to do. I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department (I faxed it to them). As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son (John) and daughter (‚ÄúSarah‚Äù) beneficiaries (POD = payable on death). This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank. After having the death certificate approved by the legal department, and verifying John‚Äôs ID, I start to talk to John about his dad‚Äôs accounts. I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks, ‚Äúone made out to each of you.‚Äù 


Now, this is before smartphones and he doesn‚Äôt have the number for his sister on his phone. I think it was because she had just moved or something. John had an address book with him and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs in here. Let me take a look.‚Äù


It was at this point that it all clicked into place for me. It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open. I knew, for at least the next minute, exactly what was going to happen. I have never had this sensation before, or after. Normally I get this feeling after something happens (d√©j√† vu). This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyes.


He looks through his address book and can‚Äôt find his sister‚Äôs number. A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things, or where he wrote things down, so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number. I have to bite my lip to not say anything. I KNOW that his sister‚Äôs number is right in his address book. I am so confident that I want to say, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs in there. Look again.‚Äù I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son, bereaving the unexpected death of his father. John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit, then looks again in his address book. He finds it this time. 


I honestly can‚Äôt remember why we needed to call her (this was about 10 years ago), but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterday.


As I told this story you might have been thinking, ‚ÄúBut this sounds trivial and minor, what gives?‚Äù Well, I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough, and I knew it while I was experiencing it. That is kinda freaky. 


I am an agnostic, and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open. Just thought that I‚Äôd share with you guys. Thanks for reading.

So this is more of a question than a tale. It's my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards. 




I work in a corner store in the south. A guy comes in and wants to put 300$ on a Green Dot card. He gives me a handful of 20$'s that reeks of weed. No biggie. I don't care where you get your money. I ring him up. Have a nice day. 




He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesn't work. I try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong. I again try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. And let me just say now that he was very, very ""southern"" so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too. 




I go to lunch and when I get back he's walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because ""I obviously don't have any money since this card screwed me over"". I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store.  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check. I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that I'm glad they'll fix it for him. He walks back to his car and I think ""gee, that's a pretty expensive car for a for a guy who's barely 20"".  But whatever. Lucky guy I guess. But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot. 





Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot. He comes back in and gets another 300$ Green Dot since the other one was bad. I don't understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesn't have money for cigs. But I don't ask questions cuz I'm new to this job and I just do what I'm told. He buys it and leaves. And then sits in the parking lot for another hour. I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes. I think that maybe he's just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I don't want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed. (I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid).  




Well. The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at 150$ a piece. But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they aren't together. I'm just really weirded out because they're acting like they don't know each other. Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour. I don't mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldn't worry about it. 





The guys leave. I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because there's a green dot limit. 




So....what was this guy doing?

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

After the lady pays she says that she forgot to use her milk tokens. Milk tokens are some sort of coupons that are given out that equate to ¬£3.10. Might be wrong but i think they are given to the unemployed. These can be redeemed against vegetables and other groceries but pretty much everything goes.

Whilst i am handing her the change she hands me the milk tokens and says ""Forgot to use these, sorry."" I explain to her I can't take them off now that she has paid but they can fix it at customer services, it happens all the time. ""They did it last time"" says the gentlemen but that seems impossible to me because of the way the system works.

I'm working on til 13 which is literally about 3 large steps away from customer service. I explain ""i can't do that because of how the system works."" ""Yes you can."" she replies. ""Get your manager they will know how"". I say ""Sure thing but i can't...""

sandiercy,1,,5,1re94i,,20,"I know, you guys are thinking that it is a pretty crappy restaurant or my service is pretty bad if all I have ever got was 2 tips.

Now the minifig dictionaries/encycolpedias generally have a cutout bit on the front cover that has a plastic container inside that contains a minifig.

Only with this particular dictionary, the minifig has been taken out. It's not difficult to do, to be honest. It's designed to be easy to open for the kids, I guess. Since the minifig was ripped off, we offered to give the dad a $5 discount off the price (it was $40) but he declined and I shoved it in the back with the rest of the books that had shit ripped off them. We get a good number of books, mostly paperback, that have cheap crappy jewelery attached and those things get ripped off all the damn time.

Mrs. BorgImplant took the theft in stride but I was kind of miffed because that was $40 bucks we could've made but didn't get to because some kid had to be a Lightfinger Louie.

copisreallybad,4,,8,1rhulb,,19,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

Greenwallets,10,,6,1r52ex,,15,"Hey guys. So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company. Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer, which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space. 

The issues we're experiencing, largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there. They're most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time (benefits, base pay + commission) as the assistant manager for this new employer.  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks, and I've had associates/managers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer. In a tone that makes it feel as though I have ""betrayed"" them in some way. 

I know it's jealousy from the associates, but it's affecting our relationship with the retailer. There's a very distinct ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us. We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isn't buying a cellular device or related accessory. Specifically, there is one associate who has made rude comments about my manager(s) and I in our vicinity, in addition to physically trying to walk through me. I should mention she did this when I worked there as well- she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there. Did I mention she's 28?

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment, and how you went about rectifying the situation. I should say that my manager isn't likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role. She's also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer.

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

TaterSaladDelta,9,,8,1re9xa,,12,"  OK, so this is basically the climax of my time at the tent. The next two stories aren't quite as grand but they are funny. 

  So this was a few years ago now, way back when I first started helping at the tent. We were sitting around, eating some greasy takeout from the chinese place in the shopping complex we were stationed in front of, when we saw him. 

  He came in skipping, he owned the place. His real name was fairly normal so my brother nicknamed him Tyrone. This kid was...interesting. First off he wasn't the best dressed. OK, I understand that not everyone can afford fitting clothes, his shirt was huge, his shorts were well...short, and his flip flops were a few sizes too small. Whatever, I don't judge.

  He was kind of dirty and looked like he needed a good hosing. This was forgivable, kids get dirty, and some don't have access to showers, I get it.

  *Then I saw the hat.*

  It was a flashy, hot pink. Add a layer of sparkly rhinestones. Then the centerpiece, a cutout of Miley Cyrus. This was Hannah Montana era cyrus. *Premium shit.* 

  The hat was ok. If he likes the queen of Disney, more power to him. But HE WAS SINGING SONG AFTER SONG AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS **HOLY SHIT** I mean maybe if his singing was good but no, it was painful. 

  So after watching him wander the tent for a few laps (yes, he went around at least 20 times) I noticed something. He was behaving oddly. Not shifty like he was going to steal something but....like a girl.

  He would do the usual ""Nyugh I'm soo hawt"" walk that girls sometimes do, the floppy hand, the rest all your weight on one leg/hip move, he missed not one nuance of the female behavior. I was astounded. To my narrow 13 year old mind, he was gay. The gay of the gays. Now I'm not so sure but then, I was convinced. 

  My brother and his friend were convinced too but they were so bored being in there constantly for 11 days that anything was cause for immediate judgement.

  So fast forward to checkout, he swaggers up to the table and makes his payment. He smacks his gum and pulls out a Miley Cyrus wallet. I know you shouldn't judge anyone but c'mon, I couldn't help but think ""what-what is he doing with...oh my""(-ley cyrus...heh)

  He then lingered for about an hour and pole danced on our tent supports. Yeah, I'm not really going to explain that one. He didn't do too much after that but he's been coming every year since then (about 3 or 4 years now) and he's lost the girl mannerisms and Miley swag, but he still compulsively lies about stuff.

  Antwon wasn't as crazy, he was just a short, portly little guy with a 70's porn stache that followed Tyrone around on his schwinn bicycle. He rides it to and from the tent every year and I see him all year around, and he's always on that bike. You'd think he would get skinnier, right? I mean he always is riding. Well, no. He just gets bigger. But it's ok, everyone loves Antwon.

  I actually do feel bad for Tyrone because he doesn't have a whole lot. I was actually inspired by him, he left me with a better understanding of the other side of life. I saw the way kids like him have to compromise, they have to use what they have to make ends meet, and they're happy doing it. He had access to a Miley Cyrus hat and sequin-encrusted wallet and damnit he was fabulous. 

  Wherever you are Tyrone, you've helped me see *the best of both worlds.*

BreakfastWithReddit,13,,18,1rcwf1,,12,"This is my first post here and as you can read my flair, I work fast food part-time and I've been working here for the past 4 months. While this story may not be about my boss or any customers, I just want to share with you how my coworker (we'll call here Sarah to protect her identity) has irritated me so much since I started working here.
So here I am, an 18 year-old male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month, I have to work the drive-thru by using the headset to take orders, making drinks, and making desserts, sometimes all at the same time. My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up. Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same time.

Meanwhile, Sarah is working the window, only transacting the money, credit cards, etc. and handing our customers their food. Quite obviously, I have a bigger job than her and as a human, I can make mistakes or be slow at times, but it's only to provide the same, excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset. For example, I might miss the chance to make the earlier customer's drinks while I am taking the previous customer's order. For a few seconds of making the drinks, delivering them, and apologizing for the wait, customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset (they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headset).

Now insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job. If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and they're waiting on me to make their drinks, I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset. While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customer's order. It can be hard at times for me because I really don't want to screw up the drink by letting the soda, tea, or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons, the liquid would spill out of the top. This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently, Sarah hates when I make mistakes like this.

She will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time, but I really want to tell her that maybe I don't want the drink to overflow or maybe that I don't want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I don't want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldn't hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me. It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask him/her again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed tone.

There were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer I'm taking an order from. When this happens, the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation. Sarah would have to ask for a manager's card to change the order at the window and then she would death-stare me as if I stepped on her iPhone. I really can't say what I feel against her because I'm working on the headset which is on 90% of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldn't want to say anything I could regret. It just makes me mad because I'm doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there, doing her window job and yelling at me when I can't finish a drink for a few seconds. She doesn't even help me finish my drinks, which would be nice, but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand, waiting for a cup to snatch. She always takes the cup right out of my hand (even when it's not done) so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her. It makes me so mad that she doesn't even lend a hand and she just stands there, being so ignorant of me while I work 3 jobs and her job only takes 15 seconds.

I'm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same, quality respect everyone else deserves. Before she started bitching at me, I tried to interact with her while we're on breaks, but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her. She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions, so I stopped, seeing that I can't break the wall that is her selfishness.

**This post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah, but here is the part that you've probably been waiting for (I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situation).**

It was 8:30 pm tonight and my shift was going to end at 9:00 pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken. I had to make a quick large-size Diet Dr. Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, wheat bun, and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich, which had me pressing a lot of buttons. At this point, it seemed that Sarah had enough of my ""dawdling"" and she finally decided to help me finish the drink, which was still fizzing at the top. I wanted to make sure the customer didn't get cheated for an under-filled large drink and I didn't want it to spill at the same time, but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr. Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker, she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform. She quickly looked away and went back to her post, acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage. I wanted to shout profanities, kick and scream at her, but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car, in complete shock of what happened. My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom. I was shaking in rage and the cold, wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up. My shift ended when I exited the restroom. I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home, still smelling of Dr. Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheel.

TL;DR Sarah, my coworker, has some kind of a bad grudge against me and I don't know why. After repeatedly telling me to hurry up with the drinks I was making, she finally decided to help me for the first time to finish a large Diet Dr. Pepper and she spilled the entire drink on me and she did not take responsibility for it.",My coworker is a terrible person,30,talesFromRetail
Endrealis,3,,4,1rged9,,13,"I think it's okay to post here. I work at a recycling center which is a bit different than retail but I deal with the same stuff. 

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language? Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads. What are you nodding too? I asked for something, I didn't ask you to agree with me...

* What can I say that will make their day?
* How can I be friendly without seeming strange?

And, when doing this, 
* What if they're busy - how can I avoid just holding up the queue?
* How should I react when the salesperson seems to be just on autopilot?

BefuddledBison,2,,4,1ric04,,23,"Howdy TFR. Turns out /u/BaffledBuffalo is taken on Gmail and Xbox Live so I changed my username to match my other accounts. At least my one post with it was sort of a one-hit wonder. 

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,3,1rigon,,20,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,2,1riony,,14,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that‚ÄîI don't put up with that sort of BS‚Äîthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it‚Äîwith an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail

As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before ‚Äì I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.

Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above ‚Äì watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.

The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition ‚Äì he was going to steal!  ‚ÄúOh shit here we go, ‚Äù I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies ‚Äì a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

‚ÄúNo way...is he really going to...‚Äù I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out ‚ÄúWoop woop woop woop!‚Äù loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

tankenka,5,,8,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

RetailQueen,8,,12,1reqkf,,0,"So tonight we had our annual holiday kick-off meeting and instead of getting me excited for holiday and all of the great things that come with it in retail, it made me want to come home and kill myself. 
Honestly, I LOVE working retail an I LOVE My job, but I honestly think this year my boss just hired the first people who came into the store and were looking for a job. I have never ever in my 6 years of working retail seen more incompetent employees in my whole life. 
First off, I'm the one in charge of training most of them, and by the way, I'm still pretty new at this job. I've only been there for about 5 months, but I guess because I'm able to catch on so quickly, and I have commen sense and know how to do things, I have to be punished by putting up with a million questions, and even more blank stares. 
Anyway, I thought I'd share some of the questions that were asked at tonight's meeting, an the responses I was giving silently in my head as I just sat there with my hea in my hands. So here you go. 
-""what we get for free though?""-first of all, learn how to speak proper English. Secondly, YOU are a seasonal employee, if you want something free, you have to earn it....shocking I know, considering by the way you're talking you've probably never had to do that for anything before. 
-""so, do we get here early or...""-hon, it's Black Friday, but no..I think you should continue the streak you have going on and show up 30 minutes late with some ridiculous excuse. P.S. I REALLY hope you don't come in after me , because if I have to wait for you to get here before I can leave my 9 hr shift I can't be responsible for what might happen to you. 
-""what do we do if a customer tells is that the price of something should be different than what it is?""-contrary to popular belief, the REGISTER is always right, not the customer. 
-""if we are supposed to work before we open, how do we get inside the store?""-I don't know, but you may want to try the door? Just a suggestion. Now that comment I actually did say out loud, and I cracked up after I said it, but just got a ton of blank stares..I guess no one else thinks I'm funny, and she proceeded to ask ""but what if the customers run us over when we open the door?"" -we work at a specialty clothing store. It's not like we are selling cheap TVs or anything anyone actually wants. No customers are going to act THAT crazy for a free tote bag. 

And that's basically the jist. I'm sure there were more things said, but I honestly don't want to remember any of it, for fear if my IQ dropping. I just don't understand why anywhere I work its like I'm the only one with any common sense. It happens every time. 

TL;DR: I swear my boss hired the most incompetent employees this holiday season, and tonight I saw all of their true colors in the form of ridiculous questions. ",Seasonal Employees,11,talesFromRetail

The house brand is decent enough, and cheap enough to buy regularly without feeling like I have to take out a loan.

metamaxwell,386,,383,1r14xk,,1115,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

I don‚Äôt speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish).

I walked up them smiling and said, ‚ÄúBastardo barato, get out.‚Äù

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

Not_A_CEO,180,,223,1rdpxf,,905,"Here's a relatively short tale today, folks.

I've posted here a few times before, and it should bear mentioning that I'm a bank teller and have been for 5+ years.  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a Teller.

I had gone through the mandatory 30-day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors, and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank.  I was technically under the 90 day Probationary stage, but for all intents and purposes I was a full-fledged employee.  Two weeks go by, and I'm steadily getting more and more comfortable.  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes, until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pants.

A customer walks in, hands me his $800 payroll check, and says he'd like to deposit it into his account.  *All right, no problem, here's your receipt, have a nice day.*  He leaves, and that's that.  Or so I thought.  About 10 minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says, ""Hey, Not_A_CEO, did you help this guy a few minutes ago?""

When I acknowledge that I did, in fact, help him with this deposit, my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guy's account and to tell him if I noticed anything ""off.""  So I did...and immediately noticed something wrong.  There's a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current day--I can see if he's been to the grocery store, a gas station, or if he's made any deposits.  Sitting in the Deposit section is...wait for it...a deposit made 10 minutes ago for the nice little sum of $100,000,000.  With my teller signature on it.

Read that sentence above again for me, would you?

**I deposited one hundred million dollars into this guy's account when it only should have been $800 dollars.**

Noticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket, and the words *Ohshitohshitohshit* start to fly about in my mind.  I'm currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me.  He affectionately calls me an idiot, and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount (which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that point).

Turns out, I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section, which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited.  Management thought it was hilarious, and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix, but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on me.

Cosmic_Hitchhiker,209,,164,1r82al,,809,"So, as you may know, thanksgiving is next week Thursday. In traditional style many people are buying their frozen turkeys in hopes that they will thaw by next tursday and of course, stores have begun handing out coupons that will alter the price/pound for said turkeys. At our store it is written AND HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW on the coupon that you *must* buy $25 worth of groceries outside of the turkey to get the discount. I've had this ""discussion"" several times already, answers vary but it's always the same basic talk and I'm honestly considering leaving my job at a grocery store because of it.


Customer: C.      Me: M

Me: hi there find everything alright today?

C: yes, I'm only buying my turkey today and I want to use this coupon.

M: well, sir/ma'am, you have to spend $25 without the turkey before you can use this coupon. 

C: well, I spent $200 the last time I came I , I'll just bring in my last receipt and you can give me the discount.

M: no, I can't. You need to spend $25 on this order to get the coupon.

C: well I spend more than $25 every time I come here!!! Ill bring this reciept when I get the rest of my thanksgiving stuff!

M: *no* you *need* to spend $25 on *this order* if you'd like to use the coupon.

C: WELL I SPEND $200 HERE ALL THE TIME I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND $25 RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS COUPON! I WANT YOUR MANAGER! I DESERVE TO USE THIS COUPON BECAUSE I SHOP HERE ALL THE TIME. 



M: ok. Hey &lt;manager&gt; 



&lt;manager&gt;: what's the problem



M: she/he would like to use this coupon



&lt;manager&gt; well did she/he get $25 worth of other groceries?



M: nope.



&lt;manager&gt; then you may not use this coupon.



C: YOU PEOPLE ARE TERRIBLE! IM GOING TO (call corporate/file a lawsuit/ burn down the store) AND IM NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN (until 4 days from now when I come back to get my other thanksgiving things)

j_guazu,97,,176,1raji3,,652,"I work in customer service at our country's state-owned electricity company. Yesterday was one of days when the technicians go around disconnecting anyone who owes over three months of bills, and I had the joy of being one of the reconnections desks dealing with the hundreds of pissed off people that had been cut off. There were a lot of idiots among them, but one guy really stood out. He came up to my window, told me his power was shut off and that he couldn't find the bills to bring with him.

Me: No problem, do you have your meter number?

Him: No.

Me: Ok then, what's your address?

Him: Two blocks from the San Miguel church on route 2, the road with the petrol station.

Me: I need to know the name of the road and the house number.

Him: Well most people call it *random nickname related to the petrol station*.

Me: But what does the city call it?

Him: It's 'Sargeant something'.

Me: Yeah, I can't do anything unless I have the bill, the meter number or the address. Could you go and call someone at the house, have them tell you the meter number and then re-join the queue?

He wasn't pleased about having to queue all over again, but went off to call whoever. Eventually he works his way back down the line, reappears at my window and reads the number off his phone:

Him: It's 1754 and the last number is either 2 or 3.

Me: What?

Him: She says the wheel for the last number is turned halfway between 2 and 3.

Me: That's not the meter number. That's the number that tells you how much electricity you've used. The meter number is nine digits and it's on the grey sticker underneath where it says ""meter number"".

I got an evil-glare from him as he went off to find out the actual number and queue for a third time. Fortunately I didn't have to deal with him on his final visit to the windows, but my colleague did. He managed to get the correct number and pay what he owed, but got angry when she told him his power would be back ""within 24 hours"". He snapped at her that he had eight chickens in the fridge that were all going to go bad if he wasn't reconnected immediately, and that he's going to write a formal complaint to the company about both of us and to demand some kind of recompense for the chickens. I really hope he does, I would fucking love to read that letter.","I can't psychically guess your address, and we're not paying for your chickens.",828,talesFromRetail
AAEmmerson,76,,100,1r7jes,,646,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about ¬£4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,566,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

diinomunster,71,,107,1rcku1,,391,"Hello my lovelies. I had a wonderful 4p-8a shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas station/C-Store. (I'm a softy who just can't say no). This offense happened around 2am. 

Now my gas station is in a really dumb place. We're in the main Highway of our city which is why we're a 24/7 store, but we're in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I don't see much traffic between midnight and four am. That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us. (Somewhere because there's a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart, a pizza Hut, a burger restaurant, a funeral home [yeah idk either], and then the bar is somewhere in that mess). 

So anyway between 130 &amp; 230 I get a nice hour of drunks. Our local police force is always really nice. They know that it's either me (5'3"" 115lbs female) or J (scrawny, but seriously awesome, little white guy) working alone. I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic. The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store. (I seriously give these guys so much free coffee). 

The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had, fresh out of the Academy. Super nice guy. Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss (we get them fresh every day so they aren't dried out if they were bagged) and thanked them when they said they'd be keeping an eye out for me. Around 150ish they had nabbed a drunk driver (yay team!) and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street. 

Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout (I'm on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit). The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store. When you walk in there's the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right, coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall. You have to walk around to your right, following the counters, to leave through the exit door. This is so you can't sneak out behind us and steal something. 

Queue 2am. I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy who's browsing our snack food quietly. In comes this super drunk middle aged black male. He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall (it's about 4.5 feet high). He will be Drunk Guy (DG). 

DG: Hey! How much for a cab to Menomininity? (I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us). 

Me: I'm not sure. We can call a cab and ask. Do you have a certain cab company you like to use? 

DG: just look some numbers up for me on the Internet. 

Me: I don't have the Internet here. I have a phone book though you can borrow. 

Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for. 

DG: NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK! 

Yeah... Okay? He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms. On his way he took out the fruit stand, the magazine rack, and the little employee break table in the hallway. 

Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom. ""That black guy grabbed me by the jacket, pulled me out of the stall, then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me."" 

Uhh.. What? 

The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit (despite me telling him he didn't have to because I have to throw it all away anyway) insists he'll stay until this guy leaves. 

Me: Yeah I don't have the time for this. I'm just calling the police. 

I get on the phone with none emergency, explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in. Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer. 

DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic.. And then he sees the officer. 

DG: AW THE FUCK YOU, YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCH!

the officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didn't fight. I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense. College kid dipped out at some point (I think he was underaged). A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as I'm talking to RideAlong for my statement. Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole. His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar. 

Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at 130 like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks can't hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster. They also haven't been letting the drunk patrons use their phone. For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone. Yeah. Screw them. 

DG got hauled off, I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up. The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation. I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders. 

I thankfully had last night and tonight off so I'll see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better. 

Well it's bed time. Sorry for the sleepy rambling. Good night TFR.

Just a quick story about a customer from yesterday.  My department is right near the DVDs and we don't have any dedicated staff manning the DVD section so obviously if someone asks for help finding something whoever would just help them.  Anyway, a woman asks for help looking for a DVD.  We'll call her Clueless Woman (CW).

*CW:  Hi I'm looking for a DVD.*

*Me:  Sure what's the name of it?*

*CW: The Counselor.*

*Me: Let's go.  It sounds familiar, how long ago did it come out?*

We get to the DVD section and I begin looking for the movie.

*CW: Oh the end of last month.*

I stop looking and turn to her, 

*""You mean it's still in theaters?*

*CW: Yea, probably, so do you have it in stock?*

*Me: Um, typically movies are in theaters for a few months, maybe 3 months or so.  So the earliest you could possibly see a DVD for a movie that came out a month ago would be February or March.*

*CW:  Could you just check in the back?*

*I directed her over to a computer where I searched the item and showed her it didn't exist yet.  She proceeds to ask me about a TV show which is in it's first season on TV right now.*

*CW: So I also want the DVD for this show called Betrayal on ABC.*  

*Me: Sure.*  

Since I'm at the computer, I look to see if we have it.

*Me:  I'm sorry nothing's coming up. How many seasons does it have so far?*

*CW:  Um, I think 1.*

I end up googling it and find out it's currently on TV.

*Me:  Well the show is currently being aired on TV so there would be no DVDs available until the show is done.*  

*CW:  When will that be?*

*Me:  Well it depends if their season goes a full season or a half season.  Again you're talking the earliest March-ish and more likely the Summer or Fall.*

*CW:  Oh ok.  Can I watch it online?*

*Me: Sure you can watch it on ABC.com, or Hulu.com*

*CW:  But I don't have a computer.*

*Me: Well depending on your tv provider, you can maybe watch it free ondemand.  Or if you can access the internet through your TV or other device...*

*CW: How would I do that?*

*Me: Do you have wifi at home?*

*CW: So that means my TV can just connect?!*

*Me: Um, about how old is your TV?*

*CW:  I've had that old TV for years.  It might be as old as you, haha.*

Me:  Then no, you can't connect to the internet unless you have a another device like a gaming console or dvd player.*

*CW:  So... maybe I should just buy a tablet so I can watch it right?*

*Me:  Umm, that's an option...if that's what you want...*

*CW:  And I'll be able to watch the Counselor on there too right?*

*Me:* ****facepalm****  *Ma'am the movie is still in theaters, no DVD is going to come out until next year.  Even then it will take awhile before you'd be able to watch it online.*

*CW:  It's fine.  So tell me about the Nexus iPads.*

*Me:...*

I go through the whole spiel of showing her the different tablets and then she stops me mid-sentence and asks the price of the tablet I was telling her about even though it was right there in front of it.

*Me:  Well this tablet is actually on sale right now for $359.*

*CW:  What!?  That's too much money just to watch this movie.*  

Then she just walks out of the store.","""I'm sorry, what you're looking for doesn't exist yet""",447,talesFromRetail
calador,41,,87,1rdykp,,377,"In 2002, I worked for a national discount department store that had filed for bankruptcy. I was the Upfront Supervisor and worked the Customer Service desk. The company decided to close stores in waves. My store was in wave two. The closing did the usual ""Store Closing! X0% off! Everything Must Go!"" signs everywhere. In smaller print under this was the caveat ""All sales final. No exchanges or returns."" This was printed on the receipt and an employee stood at the door highlighting this line and repeating it verbally before thanking them for their business. 

We were about two months into the 3 month closing sale when this 30-something man who we will call DC comes in wearing nice clothes that obviously came from one of the high-end malls within a 20 minute drive of our store.

DC was carrying a box for an RC car. He drops it on the counter in front of me and asks for a refund. I apologize and tell him that I can't give him a refund as we were closing and all sales were final. I mentioned that the manufacturer's warranty was still valid and he could contact them for repair or replacement. He started getting upset. For five minutes or so, he proceeded to verbally harangue me and said that the reason our store was closing was ""poor customer service."" I tried in vain to calm him down as he got louder and more vulgar. Finally, I asked him to either quiet down or leave. He spoke right over me, telling me where to shove this broken RC car. I snapped. 

&gt;Me: Sir, I have repeatedly asked you to calm down. Unfortunately, all sales are final. We are closing. We have signs on all the support poles and every aisle in the store saying this. Your receipt says this. There is no excuse for you to come in here and harass me like this. Now, shut up or get the hell out of my store before I call security and the police to escort you in handcuffs for trespassing. 

&gt;DC: You can't talk to me like that! I am a Customer! The customer is always right! Where is your manager. I want to talk to them about this.

&gt;Me: Sir, I have waited 6 long years to say this to one of you pretentious pricks. Shut up! You are not always right. In this case, you are definitely wrong. I have told you several times that I can do NOTHING for you. Sure, I can get my manager here. They will tell you the same thing I have been trying to get past your perfectly styled thick hair. 

*I turn and point at the Hardlines Assistant Manager. She is biting her lips to keep from laughing out loud. I can hear the laughter in her voice as she tells her customer all sales are final and thanks for the business.*

&gt;In fact, she is standing right behind me at the register, ringing customers up and telling them exactly what I have been telling you. WE. ARE. CLOSING. So, what are they gonna do? FIRE ME?!? The store closes in a month. I and everyone here is losing their jobs already. Now. GET. THE. HELL. OUT. OF. MY. STORE!

*DC immitates a fish gasping for water for a moment before turning bright red.*

&gt;DC: You have not heard the last of this. I am calling your corporate office to complain.

*He leaves in a huff, forgetting his RC car. HLM, the manager I mentioned bursts into laughter. Through her teary hiccups, she turns and looks at me.*

&gt;HLM: How long has that been bottled up?

&gt;Me: 6 long years.

&gt;HLM: You hid it well. Glad you got it off your chest?

&gt;Me: Felt good.

At this point, DC comes back in, glares at me, and snatches his RC car off the counter. I merely smile and 
tell him to have a nice day and thanks for the business.

&gt;DC: F*** you, a******!

Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

jessajuhanabi,30,,92,1rhnqp,,395,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

Jasonresno,8,,72,1r8zpa,,310,"After 5 years of slaving away at a job in retail (working my way up to management) while I studied and completed school I finally got to put my two week notice in. Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

So it's my last day of work and I've been relaxing and laughing with everybody. The phone rings.

Me (M), Customer (C).

M: Hello, this is XXXX. How can I help you?

C: Yeah. I see this product online. It's a XXX. Do you have one.

-It's not something we carry, exactly. I do have alternatives.

M: No, I'm sorry sir. We don't carry that line of products. I do have a---

C: You don't? What?

M: No, sir, we don't work with that company--

C: Seriously? You don't?

M: No, but I do have an alternative and --

C: Listen, kid, I've been buying from you guys for years. And every year you have less and less in your store. Why are you even open if you don't have what I want?

-I'm taken aback and instantly angry. I've gotten to the point where I don't react well to rude customers on the phone.

M: Due to a number of economic reasons we've focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves. It helps small companies like us stay competitive.

C: Really. Really? So you're telling me you just sell garbage?

-I pause in disbelief and just wait. The man is silent too.

M: Is there anything else I can help you with?

-Instantly angry he responds.

C: Apparently not since all you sell is trash. Really can you even

-And then I'm pretty much seeing red and I interrupt him. Sarcasm so thick I almost choked on it.

M: Yep. You're right sir. All we sell at my store is garbage. Nothing useful, just trash. Thanks for calling and please don't call back.

And then I hung up. Went over to my manager, explained what happened, and that was that. My boss didn't care. I'm done there. Feels good.","""So you guys pretty much only sell garbage now, right?"" or how I happily chewed out a customer on my last day of work.",382,talesFromRetail
Tufty89,32,,59,1rdse5,,289,"*This is a story from long, long ago, that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit. I thought you all might enjoy it.*

This happened a while ago, but it just popped into my head, so I'm gonna do my best to remember it.

I used to work nights on the checkout of a 24 hour supermarket. Now, in this particular store, there were certain things that you couldn't do on the checkout without a manager's key and a code, generally, anything that would change the total by more than ¬£2, including voiding items, would require you to call a manager.

Since we worked nights, they gave the key and the code to 2 women who worked on the cigarette kiosk, because they had worked there for a long time, there was always at least one of them working and they didn't want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake. All worked fine normally.

Until the day that neither of these women were in. Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area? Did they buggery.

There were 3 of us working that night, and the other 2 were quite new on the department. We did our best, but I was the first to go down. A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided. I put a call out for the on duty manager, then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes. The line wasn't very long, because it was getting quite late. There was a little grumbling, but everyone seemed fairly understanding.

5 minutes pass. I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY. I advise everyone to start going through the other 2 tills. I am starting to get worried, but we still have 2 tills running, so it's not the end of the world. The lines get longer.

Then, one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice. It happens, the scanners sometimes just glitch. The item cost more than ¬£2, and bam, 2 checkouts are locked down. I direct people through the lone surviving till. The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done. I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly. No answer. I call again. Nothing. I put another call out over the speakers. Apologise to all customers.

Then it happens. The last till goes down. Another double scan. The line is 15 people deep. And this is at midnight, when it's odd to have more than 1 customer at a time. I try to call the manager again. Nada. I call a team leader, explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager, any manager. I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain what's going on. I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness. Some fo them have been waiting for 20 minutes. I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isn't anything I could do. I wish there was something, anything I could do. We can't open any other tills. They are all shut down, and even if I had the key to turn them on, all of our log in's are locked into these tills.

Finally, someone saunters to the tills. They aren't a manager. They had been sent down by the on duty manager, because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator. I'm getting frantic. I send her back to find the manager.

Time passes. People have been waiting for over half an hour now, and you can imagine what that looks like. Thankfully, none of the customers are directing their anger at us, but they are all very, very angry.

Eventually, the manager turns up. All good right? Nope.

He takes one look at the scene. And walks away. The customer's see my face. Now they know what the manager looks like.

There is more of the same. Frantic phone calls, announcements over the speakers. Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later, the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd. The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me, it seems my pleas for forgiveness worked

The manager is barely listening to the poor people. He keeps interrupting them, trying to push blame off of himself. This was the first he had heard of the situation. Luckily, all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him. The manager eventually rolls his eyes, and wanders off to the office to pick up the keys.

A full 45 minutes after the last till went down, we finally got the code and unlocked the tills. Did the manager apologise to the customers? Nope. Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait? Nope. Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that? Take a guess.

As I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them. It wasn't much, but I would accept any coupon they had, even if they weren't for our store. I would ""accidentally"" mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off. If something wouldn't scan, I'd just pretend I hadn't noticed and give it to them. I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble, but I just didn't care at this point. When we cleared the line, I sent the other 2 girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it. When they were gone and I was sure I was alone, I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering. ",Cashier's Nightmare,348,talesFromRetail
blackaurora,20,,57,1r5trc,,292,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

genericname11,28,,45,1r72se,,279,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I‚Äôd much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being ‚Äúbacking‚Äù). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That‚Äôs why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it‚Äôs a land yacht. It‚Äôs being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it‚Äôs a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she‚Äôs going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

‚ÄúHey, you!‚Äù She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don‚Äôt register that she‚Äôs talking to me.

‚ÄúHey, cart guy!‚Äù She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

‚ÄúDo you ned help unloading?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNo. I want to know why you dented my car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working on the other side of the lot. I haven‚Äôt been in this area for a while.‚Äù

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. ‚ÄúYou left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?‚Äù

Ugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.‚Äù

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

‚ÄúYou have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe says you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? I‚Äôm not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. Be careful. I don‚Äôt want this happening again.‚Äù

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.‚Äù

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it‚Äôs bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

‚ÄúYou just totaled a $60,000 car!‚Äù

Now, I did not handle this well.

‚ÄúYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.‚Äù

Second rule of retail: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù It should not be, but it is.

‚ÄúI want to talk to a manager right now!‚Äù

Yuppie-Husband parks his ‚Äútotaled‚Äù car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: ‚ÄúThis kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?‚Äù

Side note: ‚ÄúTotaled‚Äù is short for ‚Äútotal loss‚Äù This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

‚ÄúLets discuss it in my office.‚Äù Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was ‚Äúmy turn.‚Äù

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don‚Äôt have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband‚Äôs fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

themonkeyone,39,,52,1r7frc,,260,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.
",The one time I almost assaulted a customer,312,talesFromRetail
Legionofclowns,54,,69,1rcc3t,,255,"First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones I've been reading on here. It's long so be forewarned. 

So it's 2006 and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis. I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt, working in the DVD/CD/Video Games area and had become one of the goto guys. The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday; we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everything.....hopefully. The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo, for this was the year of the Wii. 

Now before this i had worked with the public. Had worked at the movie theater, fast food, etc. but this was my first real retail job. I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the news.

Day comes and of course I'm there at open. I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see? A line that stretches from the door, goes around the store, comes back to the front doors, and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store. I think ""no big deal we got this."" We start handing out the tickets, before opening, for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the 30 Wiis we managed to have. And within 5 minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didn't get what and the standard bickering. Not worried, we have a cop outside keeping order. 

So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working, customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown. NOPE! 

Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of ""THEY HAVE EM!"" and ""I HAD IT FIRST BITCH!""  Going into ""oh shit"" mode I briskly jog (flat out run) to the bay and witness about 20 soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway, pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way, and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way. I mean seriously, how many times do you get to see a middle-class housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter?  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees. 

At this point I have to make a decision....do I (A.) Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or (B. ) Stop a possible murder. I go with B. and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP. I get into the bay and WHOOMP, I'm out. Don't remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor. Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system. 

At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying. When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me, but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC-10 at anything not wearing a uniform. The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure I'm alright (SPOILER: I didn't die) More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name (I'm humorous most of the time so I said Garfield, that's how they knew I was ok). I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash (still have the scar) I'm good, in fact I'm ready to go back to work. 

Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras.  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away. I've never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my 7th (although I'm with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazon.com wasn't a competitor, damn restructuring).

tl;dr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that I'm Edward James Olmos on a jetski.

I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise. For about another month, Karen the Boss, would walk around quoting the bible, telling us in private how god is present when we work and how he is the one making us an income (I never saw him working once in the store) and how we wouldn't have jobs without him...Mostly the usual Bible-Thumper stuff. This was all until I finally blew up, in front of customers...She questioned me why I never wear a Cross or St Christopher medallion and how as it was ""part"" of the dress code, I could be fired for not wearing it. I turned to her and told her my ""view"" on everything she said, she started yelling, threatening to fire me I ended up resigning on the spot and I walked out. 

Skip ahead a month...Found out she had been ""Let Go"" due to workplace harassment that was tied in with her 'views' and she was reported for Harassing me and others by my colleagues. I got a phone call and am now back working with them, turns out I got a lot of good response from customers and am now training christmas casuals!",Religion &amp; Jewelry.,310,talesFromRetail
LIVES_IN_CANADA,108,,72,1rbn62,,243,"So I used to work for a large department store in the front-end (cash and customer service mainly). At our location we had 24 cash registers, 10 of which were express (10 items or less) and the other 14 were regular belts. We also had 6 self-checkout machines that were watched over by 1 cashier at a time. This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them. 

Now I don't remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was, but I do remember that it was very busy. We had every single register open and we still had lines of 3-6 people at each register. 

When I'm watching the self-checkouts I'm watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the 48-pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned. I also have to help people out when they have coupons as 95% of the time the machine doesn't recognize them, as well as any and all questions about their purchases/prices/payment methods. So basically I'm busy running around the whole time.

So this day, while I'm watching the self-checkouts, two women who were next in the seemingly never-ending line come to one of the machines nearest to me. One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women (I found out it was the pregnant women's mother). Nothing note worthy happens with them until they're at their last item. It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart. The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness (I think she said cancer). 

Now they choose to come to a self-checkout machine. A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out. They didn't think to wait in one of the 24 other lines where you'd have a dedicated cashier who'd be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you. No, they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watch/help 6 customers simultaneously to lift and scan their item(s). 

So all that went through my head, but what came out of my mouth was ""Sure, no problem!"" and I started walking towards them (they were ~6 feet away from me). I take not more than 2 steps before the daughter says ""Oh it's alright mom, I've got this"" and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself. The mom notices that I didn't match Usain Bolt's world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me, ""What awful service you have, forcing a pregnant woman to lift &lt;item name&gt; by herself.""

I just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if they'd like more hands on service that going to one of the non-self-checkout registers would probably be better. The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on me:

""I guess some people's mothers just didn't raise them right.""

What!?! I don't know what she expected me to do, maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item? I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me, so I ignored her. It's been years since that's occurred and it's still the experience from retail that I remember best.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to. I started my first retail job in August of this year, so it's gonna be fun during the holidays when people get angry at me for ""offending"" them.

dirteater6,12,,57,1rcbas,,240,"I work as a night manager at a grocery store.  I work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., and am the highest authority in the store at night because everyone in upper management goes home.

Most of the clerks and cashiers are high school students, and I am not much older than them.  They tend to think that I'm one of them, so they don't have to listen to what I say even though I am always polite and charming when I ask them to perform specific tasks.  

Three of these kids are the embodiment of Satan himself.  They never work hard (partly because they were never respected by other managers), they swear in front of customers, throw shit across aisles, sexually harass the female workers, etc.  I absolutely dreaded the nights I worked with them because I knew nothing would get done and I would be promptly yelled at the next day because of this.

Anyway, about a week ago they were all caught by the bookkeeper for some pretty bad stuff.  They would steal VISA gift cards, use manager numbers to override the difference on the register so it balanced, and they also stole booze, pizza, and many other things.  This supposedly went on for a couple months, and the three of them had their own little operation.  They ended up stealing $48,000 worth of gift cards.

groundciv,28,,49,1r4jqn,,233,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

If you've read my previous posts on here, I try to show how much fun I have with the people I worked with as we have plenty of horror stories on this sub-reddit. I've worked with a fantastic group of people,  Black Friday was no different. 

I woke up at 2am, getting ready to start my twelve hour split shift. I was to work from 3am to 11am then come back and work 6pm to closing. A pretty long day to say the least. I grabbed a couple of five hour energies, and jumped into my gaming department. Today was some of the holiday paid workers' first day, so they were mainly there to direct people around the store. This is the story of one of those fellas. We'll call him G. 

I began talking with my group, showing them what we wanted to sell, reminding them of the deals to promote etc. While I did this, the group of people came in. 

The way we did it, was we had a route for all customers to follow no matter what. People were to follow this route until they got to the department of their choosing. They were to grab what they wanted, then move back into the line as the route ended at the registers. It was a very organized system to say the least. While the people were being herded through the lines, I began to hear screaming. 

This wasn't a AHHHH I'M IN TROUBLE kind of screaming this was a YEAHH WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!!! kind of screaming. My customers as if they were queued by a director all looked towards the isle, as did I. It was G. He was standing there holding the festive balloons cheering on our customers. 

**G:** OH you got THAT AWESOME LOW PRICED WII?? CONGRATS MAN WOOOOO HOOOO!!!!

You have to realize, this is a high ceiling open area store, and everybody in the store can hear him. 

**G:** BBBBLLLLACCCCKKKK OOOOPPSSS!!!! WOOOO HOOO!!! YOU GOT IT BRO! All I gotta say man is ZOMBIES!!! KILL THE ZOMBIES MAN!!!! 

I began to realize he was cheering our customers on, and just having a good old time. As he did this, other holiday people who also just started on Black Friday began to shout and cheer the customers on. I guess they thought this guy who started it all was somebody who had worked there for a while, and they thought it was normal. 

Basically, I thought it to be fantastic. I had one of the radios on me, and knowing that none of the new guys had radios, I began to talk about it. 

**Me:** You guys hear that? 

**Manager:** You mean the likely sound of epic tickling?

**Me:** Your neighbors must complain a lot if your wife sounds like a male screaming when you tickle her. 

**Manager:** Yeah you'd be surprised. Tell the new guys to put a cork in it. 

**Me:** Well, the customers kind of like it. 

**Manager:** They like being tickled eh? 

**Me:** ...

**Me:** Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.

**Manager:** Well who am I to stop them then?

**Me:** Yeah seriously, you're not God. 

It got to the point where most of the new people (and some of the regular employees) began to do this, all because of G. 

I don't work there anymore, but recently I visited the store to see some old friends. G is still there, and he's a supervisor now. I think the man deserves it, as long as he doesn't tickle our customers.

arsci991,56,,35,1ren2b,,217,"All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories, one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe. It's kind of a long one, but hopefully you all enjoy it!

A little background: I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items, including gun safes. This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year. We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see, with the largest (at the time) being an Canon Armory 80-gun safe. This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock. Our store only ever had 2 of them, they never had an official SKU#(we had to ring them under the generic ""merchandise"" SKU), we had them for over a year, and after we sold out we never saw them again. Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer, but they all ship with the same combination: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes, or by just guessing. It was no secret, and we encourage people to take a good look.

It was the evening, and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day. Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down. I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by, and he looked PISSED. And not just ""end of black friday"" pissed but ""someone done fucked up"" pissed, so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe. Literally ear to the door, asking if it was doing alright. Maybe not to the safe, but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe. Uh Oh. Things start running through my head...why didn't he just unlock it? HOW did a person get locked in it? Then he pulls me aside.

Assistant Manager: ""We have a situation.""

Me: ""A situation?""

AM: ""Yes, a kid just locked his brother in the 80-gun.""

Me: ""Soo why don't we unlock it?""

AM: ""It won't unlock. I think the battery died, but I replaced it and it's still not working.""

Me: ""How did he end up locked in it?""

AM: ""His brother apparently. He's over hiding in the feed racks last I saw. Not sure where the parents are, they haven't made an appearance yet.""

I went over and tried it myself, and sure as crap...it's locked. And this kid is FREAKING out, for obvious reasons. We tried a couple other batteries with no luck, and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other 80-gun, with no luck. The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs. 

We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little, and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup. Assistant Manager called the police, while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safe.

After about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out, we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a 5 minute lockout on the keypad...if the battery dies or is removed, you can't touch it for 5 minutes after putting the battery back in. So after 5 long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions, the safe OPENED. And this 15 year old kid, I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe, straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears. 

The police and fire department left pretty quick after that, but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us. Complaining about precautions, safety, how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently. Eventually we stopped her,

AM: ""Ma'am, your kid walked up to the safe, entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe. Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did, the battery died. At this point the brother closed and locked the door. And it's our fault for not taking enough precautions?""

Eventually the woman and her kids left. No policies changed, except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do. Gives us all a good chuckle. Every couple months she calls, and identifies her self as ""the person whose kid got locked in the safe."" Usually she's prying to know if we've changed our policies (we haven't) then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of (which she doesn't get). Oddly enough, its been another year and we've had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes!

I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,46,1rh8hc,,201,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

prickelypear,23,,27,1rf2t9,,187,"I've lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can remember.

I used to work in a big name retail store in a college town, we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously, and they were generally pretty laid back customers. But of course we got older customers as well.

One night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line. It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come. One of items was a basket, it looked like wicker but I don't remember what it was exactly. Either way when I rang it up it came up full price, ~$30-$40, and the woman stopped me.

**Woman:** That's supposed to be on sale, why is it ringing up full price?

**Me:** I'm not sure, I'll get one of the girls from that department to come up and she'll know what's going on.

While I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle (which this store doesn't have, we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much) and how this is so aggravating. Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the ""Clearance aisle"" and it's ringing up full price and she knows it wasn't placed there by another customer because there were many of them there. The girl from hard lines informs the woman we don't have a Clearance Aisle, but she knows where the baskets are and she will go look.

While we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up. Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others. The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale, the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one, it's full price and walks off. 

**Woman:** (to me) Well he needs the basket for his clothes.

**Me:** Okay (and I start to place it in the bagging area)

**Woman:** No! I'm not paying that price for it. I want it for the Clearance price! You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price. 

I don't remember what she was saying the ""Clearance price"" was, but it was far below the actual price. Usually if its less than $5-$6 we were told just give it to them, and even sometimes if it's $10 on something worth at least $35. But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be $15.

**Me:** Ma'am we don't have a Clearance aisle, the basket is full price and I don't have a way to lower it in my system.

**Woman:** That's bullshit, if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you *can* adjust the price!

**Me:** This store *doesn't have* a Clearance Aisle. We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isn't one of them.

**Woman:** No. That basket was on the Clearance Aisle. Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale. That one is too. I'm getting that basket but I am *not* buying ~$30-$40 for it. Where are the managers? This is bullshit I'm not dealing with you anymore.

So, with the woman's son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes, I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up. I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time; manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer, customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things, manager gives them what they want, and customer leaves smug. Not this manager, she always was my favorite. She gets to my till, listens to the, of course now calm and smiling woman, explain why she wanted the manager. 

**Woman:** So see? the basket was on the Clearance Aisle, but it rings up full price. If it's not on Clearance then it shouldn't have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there, and I need it, I expect to get it for the Clearance price.

**Manager:** (Smiling at her) We don't have a Clearance Aisle. That basket is in the home section with the other baskets. We have baskets on sale in that aisle, they have tags marking them. But this one isn't on sale. If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get one.

**Woman:** (smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes) NO! I will **NOT** go pick out another basket because of your mistakes!!! *I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance price!*

**Manager:** (still calm and smiling) Well, seeing as we still don't have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price. We aren't lowering it. If you want the basket it's ~$30-$40. Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase, you can pay for your other items and leave.

**Woman:** (screaming at this point) I'm never coming back here again, but I'm not done with this yet! This is ridiculous! I'm writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers! I will make sure you both lose your jobs! You can keep this shit, I'm not buying **ANY** of it!!

And with that she stormed off and out the door, leaving her son to mutter ""I'm so sorry..."" and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day. Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman. Nothing was going to happen. And nothing did. So much for not being done with it yet, we didn't hear a thing about about her after that. Her son did frequent the store though.

racheecakes,8,,52,1rhjav,,203,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

Bunbury42,45,,39,1raduq,,176,"I work at a specialty retail store that sells a wide variety of one very specific item. We were running a coupon that offered people to buy 2 and get 2 free. A woman comes up to the register and presents her shopping basket, which contains 4 of the item and a few other things. First issue is that she has mixed in things that aren't part of the coupon. Technically I'm not supposed to allow that, but she was actually buying a worse deal than she could otherwise get. 

Me: ""Ma'am, the sizes you're getting aren't part of the coupon. I'm happy to adjust it for you, but it's actually a better deal to switch to [insert item info here]"" 

Woman: ""That's fine. I prefer these."" 

 Me: ""No problem at all"". 

It's strange to not want more for the exact same money, but if she's happy, that's fine. I get to the end of the transaction and inform her of her price. It's something around like $122.30. She hands me another coupon offering $15 off a purchase of $45 or more. Two red flags. First, we can't stack two kinds of coupons together. We can stack the same coupon in some circumstances, but different types we usually can't. Second, the coupon she gave me expired over a month ago. 

Me: ""Ma'am, I unfortunately can't take this coupon. It expired over a month ago."" 

Her: ""Yes you can. Just manually override it."" 

She's correct. Technically I could just drop her price. I shouldn't, but could.

Her: ""Fine. Just forget it. I don't appreciate it and I won't be back."" 

Me: ""I apologize. If you're unhappy, [Company name here] is always happy to hear comments and suggestions.""

insecure_shit_knob,30,,42,1r2plz,,178,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

TennisAndBeer,4,,37,1r63y6,,168,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman.

meguriau,19,,26,1r5sy8,,170,"Hi TFR, I‚Äôm back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It‚Äôs been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn‚Äôt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That‚Äôs preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs the most I can do for you at this point in time. We‚Äôll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN‚ÄôT DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I‚Äôm terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you‚Äôd left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN‚ÄôT CALL. 

**M:** I‚Äôm sorry to hear of your husband‚Äôs ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let‚Äôs just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don‚Äôt need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that‚Äôs retail!

xVarekai,86,,35,1r3e2x,,162,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

wigglemaster,46,,23,1r3cg6,,160,"So I have been reading this subreddit for a while and all of your retail horror stories help make my day manageable. Sorry if there are any formatting errors, but I am on my phone and it is my first post. 

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.

spotty82,18,,28,1r43bb,,147,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

Foliagus,31,,31,1r761t,,145,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.

MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,,19,1rep4z,,145,"A little backstory: I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school. I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes, however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy people...to be quite honest, I really enjoyed my time at this store...All my managers were great, it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool. I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked with...I guess it was kind of a utopian retail job.  

Now, a little more background about my particular job responsibilities...I was the stock room manager, I was the person that met the truck at the back door at 5am every tuesday, thursday, and saturday.  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipment....I knew how many boxes were coming, I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment.  In a nutshell, I knew the stock room backwards and forwards, knew what we had back there and what we didn't have because I unpacked it, organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers. There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor, and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they needed.

This particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times.  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me.  A little about our return policy...With a receipt and tags on the clothes, there was no time frame for returns.  You can buy something, put it in a closet for ten years, decide you don't want it and bring it back.  No problem.  If you don't have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes, you can always return them....things stay in the system basically indefinitely...but if you don't have the receipt, we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get.  If it says 50 bucks on the tag but comes up .25 cents, you get .25 cents back.  who knows what reduction stickers you've peeled off the tag.  So all this being said, here is my actual story...and I only remember this because in almost a year, this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this job.

Nice lady (NL) comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counter.

NL: Hi, MrDoctorSmartyPants!  How are you?  I haven't seen you the last few times I've been in here!

Me:  It has been a while, I'm doing pretty good...do you want to return these pants?  Do you have your receipt?

NL: I sure don't, but I've never taken the tags off of these as you can see, so I can still return them right?

Me: Yep you sure can, but, unfortunately if you don't have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as, and I'm sure you bought these a while back because I've never seen these in this store. (It should be noted the tag said $65 bucks for these particular pants)

NL:  Ok, that is fine, I've dealt with that before...but the tag says $65 dollars, and just because I don't have my receipt doesn't mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchase.

Me: I know you come here all the time, but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants, we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never there...and to be honest with you, in the time that I've worked here (since the store opened) I have never seen these pants, did you purchase them at another location?

NL:  Yes, but that doesn't matter because I paid $65 for them like a year and a half ago, and I've never worn them...but lets just return them and see what I can get back for them.

Me: ok, lets see...(at this point I scan the item and it comes up, no shit, at $2.45) Ok, it says $2.45.

NL: WHAT? That's robbery! That CAN'T be right.

Me: I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you, I explained our policy and you said you understood.  I've returned things without a receipt for you before....if I could give you more, I would...but I can't and I don't have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads.  

NL: Well this is absolutely unacceptable.  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost me....I know the policy but this is a little different...i paid a lot for these pants...this should be an exception!  I want to see a manager!

Me: Ma'am, I am the stock manager, I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants before...I'm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you, but I can't.  Honestly, this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy exists.

NL: Can't you just go look to make sure?  

Me: Sure, I'll do that for you.  (at this point i go in the back and out the back door for 10 minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back)  Nope.  We don't have any.  what the computer shows is the best I can do.

NL: NO! I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER! LESLIE! WHERE IS SHE?

Me: She isn't here today, ma'am...I'm the only manager in the store.

NL:  Well call her!

Me: I don't have her home number and I'm not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue.  I'm not making you return the pants, I'm not forcing you to take this money....you can keep the pants.

NL:  This is so stupid...I can't believe you're treating me like this! I come in here all the time! You should make exceptions!  Just give me my money and I'll be on my way...I don't want these stupid pants.

Me: Ok, Ma'am...here you go $2.45.  I'm really sorry for your inconvenience, have a nice day.

NL:  Yeah, you ruined this nice day! Wait until I talk to your manager!

I actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about something....the lady walked up and said hello, was cordial, and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior.  Sorry if this is so long, it wasn't even that bad...it just stuck out in my mind.

prettehkitteh,24,,30,1rcsdq,,140,"Wall of Text coming! 'tis the season, and I'm feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they don't need. I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier, so I never really experienced Black Friday - except one year, when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side. I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning. For some reason, the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at 5am. I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout, and we had special areas where the really popular/discounted toys were set up the day before, so I pretty much had no idea where anything was.

We didn't get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon, but people were lined up, and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early. I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside. I was immediately flooded with shouted questions:

""WHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOS?!""
""WHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SON!!""
""I NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTION?!""

I did my best to stutter answers out as people didn't even stop moving for me to answer. I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos (TMEs from now on) were because everyone wanted one. I could not believe how many people wanted one. I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive, and after the initial rush for the first two hours, people started being a little more polite, though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on. That was when crazy beard came in.

CB was a grungy ex-confederate-looking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face. He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded, ""I need a TME."" 

Me: ""Of course sir, if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right, they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle, you can't miss them.""

CB: ""Are you sure there are any left?""

Me: ""I haven't been back there in a little while, so unfortunately I don't know, I'm sorry.""

He waved a hand at me and scurried off. I thought that was the end of it. A minute later, he scurried back, visibly a lot more agitated.

CB: ""There were no TMEs!""

Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we did have some this mor--""

CB: ""How could you not have any TMEs?! You must have more in the back, I need one!""

I knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before - there was no backstock. I tried to explain this to CB as he started shaking.

CB: ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEs!""

Me: (fishing for anything to get this guy off my back) ""I-I'm sorry sir, there's not much I can do. If you had gotten here earlier--"" (big mistake)

CB: ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN I GET HERE, YOU'RE A FUCKING TOY STORE, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES?! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER!""

Those magic words. I was shaking now (I don't handle anger very well) and was relieved to get some help. I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom. CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his world-ending problem, but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder. We waited. I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers, so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CB.

Five minutes passed. I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom, trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers. CB wasn't amused, so I just kept standing there, shuffling my feet. I couldn't leave the guy, so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing. Another five minutes passed.

CB: ""What the fuck is taking him so long?""

Me: ""I don't know, I'm so sorry, I can go look for a manager if you want.""

CB: ""You're staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up, I know a cop out when I hear one.""

Me: ""I'm not trying to abandon you sir, I want to help--""

CB: ""You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HEAR ME?""

I was on the verge of crying at this point. I picked up the phone for a third time, trembling, trying to take a breath so I didn't start crying over the intercom - when the lead manager Tim finally showed up, out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly. CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim, who was 6'3"", built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long, braided black beard. Tim, who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees, asked ME what the problem was, which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitless.

Me: ""We're out of TMEs, and he really would like one.""

CB: ""That's RIGHT. I have a problem with the fact that--""

Tim: ""Just a moment, sir. Prettehkitteh, thank you, you can go back to the front.""

I scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didn't have TMEs, we didn't have TMEs. I watched as CB's anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little, to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tim's best gentle giant voice. Within two minutes, Tim smiled and pointed out the door. CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out. 

Tim came over to me, gave me a big hug, and told me to go take a breather in the back room. The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively, and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand.

Techsupportvictim,9,,46,1ragwd,,137,"Another tale (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1raduq/yesterday_i_was_fussed_at_for_not_accepting_an/) reminded me of this jem

When I was working big box ish books and more, I would get folks demanding we 'override' coupons all the time. And I was the manager. Old coupons, coupons they were clearly trying to double up etc. Thing was we had no override. It was all off bar codes and your reward card. Once something was 'past its sell by' forget it.

I had one day where we had this 'bounce back' redeeming. It was right after holidays and it was a 50% off the REGULAR price of one hardcover book. Art books excluded (being near a high end area we had some crazy expensive titles we basically sold at cost). 

All day folks are trying to stack it on NYT titles, use it on movies so on and so on. I'm down to my last hour and I'm just tired of it. I've already kicked out four folks for calling lawsuit (price company policy we stop all transactions at that point), with four 'I'm going to get you fired' rants. We have to document in detail all customer issues so I had paperwork on all four of them and the other yelling customers. Thankfully for every yelling customer there were several that just shrugged it off as their failure to read.

So I'm in the back, not actually the floor manager that hour, helping the stock room guys pull up their sold today lists to see what needs to go on the restock carts. A call comes back that our FM is with a customer and there's a guy yelling he wants the manager. Sure I'll come out. 

Guy wants to use the coupon on an art book. He's been told no, they are excluded. He's yelling that the cashier can and will take it etc. I cut in and introduce myself as the manager. He goes through his rant again. I explain that it's all programmed into our software and no we can't. He gives that manual override line. With some swear words tossed in. And some 'if that stupid cashier' comments

I'm done. I really want to hulk out on the guy. But I don't. I'm not sure how I kept my cool but I did. The rest of the convo goes something like: 

Me: so vacation or do you have a home here too

Him: excuse me?

Me: I said are you on vacation or do you keep a home here as well as (city our home office is in)

Him: I live here, why the bleeping bleep would I live there

Me: because the only way you can say what our system can and can't do is if you helped right it and those staff all work at the home office. 

Me (rubbing it in) and as a member of the home office you are fully aware that all employee purchases must be rung up by a manager and employees are not allowed to avail themselves of a reward card or the coupons issued in that program. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to report these violations and your harassment of my staff to HR. 

Me: (still rolling with it) if you would like to purchase this book I will ring you up for the employee discount of 10% for art department titles. What was your employee number? 

At which point he walked out without saying a word. And no I didn't think he was an employee I just said it to shut him up and make him hopefully see what a fool he was acting by telling us how our stuff runs. 

Never saw him again, never heard anything about him calling and complaining. Although our camera system has audio and our home office can and does remotely capture all footage to keep us honest. My district manager apparently saw that particular moment and was quite amused. 

TLDR: random customer tries to school us on our point of sale systems, I demanded his employee number to properly ring him up. ",What's your employee number again?,183,talesFromRetail

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16. ¬†Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure. ¬†He wants desperately to be cool. He‚Äôs got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid ‚Ä¶

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid‚Äôs church bow tie and his wife‚Äôs apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I‚Äôm bagging groceries. It‚Äôs Labor Day, so I‚Äôm constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

‚ÄúHey, are you unmined?‚Äù

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She‚Äôs my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and ‚Äúyeah‚Äù is all I can manage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I‚Äôve known since elementary school.
‚ÄúYou working all day today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBummer. We‚Äôre having a pool party. You could have come.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I‚Äôm here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I‚Äôm totally scared of talking to girls.

‚ÄúI wish I could. I hope you‚Äôre having a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe we can do something next week.‚Äù Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

‚ÄúTotally. You have a pen?‚Äù

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I‚Äôm both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy‚Äôs Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

‚ÄúCall me. We‚Äôll set something up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, thanks!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you later!‚Äù She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it‚Äôs all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I‚Äôm feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I‚Äôm so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom‚Äôs stash (don‚Äôt do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she‚Äôs just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bummed. This went by took quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has,‚Äù I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR ‚Ä¶ next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I‚Äôd give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it‚Äôs indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I‚Äôll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","‚ÄùBag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2‚Äù or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",198,talesFromRetail
littlewoolie,8,,29,1r6hc9,,131,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,160,talesFromRetail
aturquoiseseashell,12,,24,1rg9do,,128,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch‚Ä¶""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am‚Ä¶"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever. This pair of kids walk in, one looks 15, the other maybe 11, and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone. Well, manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM. I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security. Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream!!  He stops her, calls her mom, who comes in SCREAMING at her (in perfect english) and makes her spit out those earrings. We only got 3 out of 4 back. She can keep the last one.

This one is more asshole manager than customer.

In our little unit there was very few places to actually store things, so most of our stuff was stored in the bowels of the airport. To get it up into the behind security bit of the airport was a real pain.

We had store guys who'd pack a cage of goods, like the big tall ones you'd see in a supermarket, but then we had to take them into a separate room, with airport security, and unpack all the boxes onto a big scanner, and then repack the cage. Often single handedly running back and forth to either end.

It's a royal pain in the butt, and even worse that 99% of the security guards shrugged and said not my job if something was about to fall off or break. I don't blame them, was just a pain. 

Well one day to do this job, when I start unpacking the cage I notice that there's a puddle of milk underneath. (For the record our milk came in boxes, with a huge plastic bladder inside), so obviously it was leaking, which in itself was not hugely unusual, you'd just grab the mop in there and clean it up. 

So I put them on the belt and send them through, when finally they get to the other side I lift them off, as  i do so, the bottom of the boxes opens, and about 40litres of milk gushes out, all over me, and the floor. I get absolutely soaked. 

I have to keep packing the trolley though, because some of the stuff is frozen and you have to do it in quick time. Except the second box of milk does pretty much the same again, as soon as it touches the cage, it explodes over the floor. 

At this point, i'd been working since 4am, it was 1 pm, i'd had no breakfast, a non stop morning, and was tired and emotional and somewhat covered in 80 litres of milk,

Under threat of death from security, I was told I had to clear it all up, because yeah milk smells. So I traipsed the cage upstairs and to my manager (a different supervisor to Bacon sandwich man) who's just finishing off his break (after an hour working).

I ask him for an extra pair of hands to get the whole thing cleared up because quite frankly it was going to take me for ever. He stands up, and laughs in my face, and walks off shouting ""get a mop bucket and do it yourself"" - It really did take all my powers of self control not to rugby tackle him and punch his head in, but I'm honestly close to rage tears with being so tired drenched. 

I gather my thoughts and go do the job, as unpleasant and as long as it took me, when I get back, and ask for my meal voucher for my break, he tells me I used it all up cleaning up the milk, It's only when I stand up face to face with him (i'm at least 6'3 to his 5'7) and remind him of my legal rights to a break that he backs down.

Needless to say I refused to ever work with him again, and he quickly got transferred to another shop in the airport. That was the worst day of my retail life I think. ",Why I nearly cried over spilled milk,134,talesFromRetail
rumplesplitskin,25,,15,1re4w8,,114,"We had a power cut at the station the other night, thankfully the only customers in the shop were just in buying a few grocery items. Nobody was on the forecourt getting fuel at the time. The only power we had was the emergency battery back up that powers the lights, nothing else no tills, pumps or computer. Even the main door had to be physically pulled open to let people out, it was obvious to anyone with a IQ over that of a cabbage that we were not open for business.

Those customers that were in at the time understood that because of the outage we could not process and credit/debit cards and worse still we could not open the tills to give change. It was a pain in the arse but we managed to give change by breaking in to the staff tea kitty so we got by without having to refuse any sales.

Then the last in the line a 18ish old guy decided that he needed petrol. This following is how that conversation went..

ME : Ok, your total comes to ¬£2.56. Due to the power cut we can't open the tills so if you have close to the correct amount in cash that would be a help.

PP(petrol pr*ck) I only have some pound coins is that ok ?

ME : Yeah, that's fine. We'll just call the total ¬£2.50 and i hand him a 50p coin back.

PP : Thanks, i'll hand in the 6p next time ok ?

ME : Naw, that's ok. Don't worry about it.

PP : Thanks, bye.

Just as my cashier is pulling the door open for him he stops and turns back to me.

PP : Oh i think i better get some petrol for the morning.

ME : Sorry, but we have no way to sell you fuel. Everything including the tills is out so i can't take payments.

In hindsight i should have worded this differently but it was late and i was just wanted him out of the shop so we could close early and get on with documenting tonight's outage for the next shift in the morning.

PP : Then i'll just leave you the cash and you can ring it up when the power comes back on.

ME : Sorry but i can't do that.

PP : (cuts me off) But i NEED petrol, you'll just have to figure something out.

He then storms out to the pumps where he's parked and lifts the nozzle expecting the petrol to flow. I'm looking at my cashier asking him did that really just happen ? After a good ten seconds or so with the guy waiting out there he waves his arms to get my attention and shouts at me to ""turn the fucking pump on!""

I grab the padlocks that we use to lock the pumps overnight with and head out to let this idiot know that he's not getting petrol from us tonight. As i'm walking over to him he's still standing there with the nozzle in his car looking at me like i'm the idiot.

ME : We have a power cut. We have no power to turn the pumps on.

PP : Don't lie to me, your lights are on. you have power, you just want to get home don't you ?

ME : Yes i do want to get home but i still can't give you any petrol without electricity to power the pumps. Those are emergency battery lights.

PP : I NEED petrol, what are you going to do ? i'm not leaving until i get my petrol.

ME : (really pissed off now) Well what i'm going to do i lock these pumps, close the shutters and then go home.

PP : WHAT ? You can't talk to me like that i'm a customer.

ME : No, you're a f**king idiot. now leave before i call the police to have you removed.

Normally i would never talk this way to any of our customers but this guy's attitude and pure dumbness just hit a nerve with me.

PP : Fuck you, you fat munt.

ME : Yeah ok, just leave.

PP : I want to talk to your manager, you're getting fired!

ME : I am the manager and i'm telling you to leave the premises before i call the police.

He drops the nozzle on the ground and looks at me as if to say pick that up bitch!

ME : Really ? What are you a child in a man's body ? Grow up.

PP : F**k you.

He gets into his car and drives off but not before leaving a parting shot of calling me a fat cow. Ok, i was a little taken back by this as i'm a 6.2"" hairy arsed dude with three day old stubble but still a cow ? that really hurt :)

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

SuzyGreenburg,10,,12,1re89p,,109,"When I was bar tending one evening a guy that I knew by name only came in.  He stumbled up to the bar and ordered his drink, a martini of some kind I think.  As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it, he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldn't figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me.  I ignored him and finished the drink.  As I handed it back, he looked at it, told me anybody could make a martini, and slapped 36 cent on the counter.  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached, turned back around and said ""I think I tipped you to fn much.  I can make my own gd martini next time.  Enjoy your minimum wage.""  Okay.  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing I'd said the entire time was ""What would you like to drink?""  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness, but I brushed it off; just another night at the bar right?

Fast forward an hour or so and I go down to meet my husband at another bar on the property that stays open after the hotel bar closes.  Who should be there, but the jerk from before.  When he spots my husband he comes directly over and starts chatting him up because they'd known each other as kids and were friendly.  When my husband introduced me to this guy, it was like I was talking to a completely different person.  He was all compliments and can I by you a drink and it's so nice to meet you lets get a table together.  

Clearly this guy did not recognize me from before.  I stood there looking at his stupid face trying to remain calm, but the more I thought about it, the angrier I became.  When I'm in service mode I'm worthy of ridicule and rudeness, but as my husband's wife I'm someone he wants to be friends with?  I decided I couldn't let it pass.  By the end of my tirade my husband was holding me back, jerk off had spilled his drink on himself and was profusely apologizing while trying to blend into the wall.  He left shortly thereafter and called my husband the next day to apologize sober.  

Ugh!  Still makes me angry, but I hope at least he is hesitant to treat others this way now.  My only regret is that I couldn't handle him in a classier way, but oh well.

talesfromesalesthrow,16,,30,1r6n0m,,100,"Apologies for the length. I just needed this out of my system. Since I've only experienced support on this sub, I need to get this out there. 

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Queue Asshole-Negger. Let's call him A.N. for short. 
A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking.""

Mystic-Spiral,23,,29,1rb12d,,96,"This is a story of a horrible client, a weak manager, and a poor associate (me) caught amidst it all. 

It was a dark night in late spring. The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms. I love my job and my customers at this store (this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location) are generally exceptionally awesome. Even the ‚Äúbad ones‚Äù aren‚Äôt really THAT bad and only minor annoyances. Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD (manager on duty) and I were cleaning up around the store. Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being.   

For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine; I know, somehow, that this is going to be bad. 

DB: ‚ÄúI bought this dress the other day (whips out cotton dress) and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back. Can I exchange it?‚Äù

Me: (Hoping this is easier than I first thought) ‚ÄúOf course, let‚Äôs see if we still have another in the same size!‚Äù(Extra small petite)

We did not. 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry; it doesn‚Äôt look like we have another in the same color and size. We can exchange it for a different color, or I can refund you back your money for it, no problem!‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo, I want to wear THIS one!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI can look it up and see if another store has it if you want. We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there. We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer, but if there is a low inventory, there‚Äôs no guarantee you will get t unfortunately. The inventory is about 24 hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shown.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúNo. That is unacceptable. I want this one! Can‚Äôt you just sew a new button on it?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt have spare buttons, but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesn‚Äôt look off balance if you like.‚Äù (Mind you the button is TINY. About half the size of a dime. It‚Äôs really not that big of an issue.)

Now, this where things start to go downhill. 

DB: ‚ÄúWhat will you do with the dress if I return it?‚Äù  
Honesty, to me,  is the best policy, but had I known how this was going to go down, I probably would have just lied to this person.

Me: ‚ÄúMost likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped out.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúThen rip a button off another dress and sew it to this one!‚Äù

I am VERY taken aback by this.  She wants me‚Ä¶.to destroy‚Ä¶. No way! Just. No. 

Me: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm sorry, I cannot destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúWHAT?! You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it, what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent out?!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWell, that dress is now YOURS since you bought it. You can do with it what you will, and if you return it, then it becomes the property of the company again,  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor. The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúI RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS! YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANT!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI am not going to destroy company property. You can return the dress or I can find one at another store. Those are your options. I am not risking my job by destroying company property.‚Äù

DB: ‚ÄúTHAT IS BULL SHIT! YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY! I RAN A BUSINESS! I KNOW! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAlright, MOD (who has been listening the whole time) this client would like to speak with you.‚Äù

The MOD comes over and I walk away, continue to tidy up the store and do my job. Then I see the MOD take the client‚Äôs dress‚Ä¶. And the dress on the floor‚Ä¶. I'm thinking that she CAN'T POSSIBLY be doing what I think...Yes, the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DB‚Äôs dress. 

Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on. During the entire time DB won‚Äôt stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy, etc etc etc.  She then turns to me again and tells me ‚ÄúLosing your job over making a customer happy? That is SUCH bullshit! I don‚Äôt know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPY.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond, it will be nasty. 
DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes over.

MOD: ‚ÄúMystic-Spiral, I‚Äôm sorry that I went over your head and did that. I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didn‚Äôt want a scene.‚Äù 

I REALLY loved that MOD, she was like another mom to me, but I absolutely could not respond to her. I don‚Äôt think I said a word for the rest of the evening. The whole thing boils my blood even now. 

So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave, you can get someone to destroy company property just so you don‚Äôt have to fork over a few cents for a replacement button at a fabric store.

Sapphires13,19,,19,1r8o2i,,96,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""   
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""   
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""   
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""   
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""   
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""   

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""   
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""   
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""    
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""    
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""   
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]    
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""    
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""   
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""    
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",115,talesFromRetail

Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

KroipyBill,11,,41,1rhynu,,124,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

thompsontoons_art,16,,15,1r9l9k,,98,"Customer walks up to me just as I'm about to go on my late afternoon lunch break. She says she's there to pick up an order for [X person name: We'll call her Fuddle Duddle], and it should be a couple of bedskirts. She received a call that the order was in. Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse. I go to our holds area to find the order...

...there's no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me. I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer. 

""Ma'am, you said your name is Fuddle Duddle? I don't see any orders out back with that name attached.""

""Well, no. My name is Sue. Fuddle is my friend; I'm in the area, so she asked me to pick up her order for her.""

The next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up. Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few large-ish purchases. Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure she'd paid for the order being shipped to the store, and it just needed to be picked up. I look through our log book listing paid for pick-up orders, and there was no listing of Fuddle's name in the book. I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for; if this was the case, our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after 48hrs. Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts. I tried looking up Ms. Duddle's customer information in our register and through our catalog system, and I found no purchase records at all. 

""Well, that can't be right,"" Sue said, ""We were here in the store. We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff. We were here for hours. You must have a record."" I informed her that their purchases would be in our records, but they wouldn't be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them. Since their names didn't come up in our profile search, I figured they'd opted out of having a profile created. 

Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information. Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle. I inquire what style bedskirt it was that she'd ordered for pick up, and she said she couldn't really describe it. (She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store, but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasn't available in store at the time.) Supposedly it was a plain tailored style, and she had a receipt for the item at home... but she wasn't at home that very moment, so she couldn't give me the information on the receipt. She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt, but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order... which she said is, ""...a queen sized dust ruffle in white... or maybe it was two twins."" She couldn't even remember what she ordered. I described a couple of the styles to her, and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely. I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone else's name, and she said no... but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up. So... we had a third person involved in this order. I took down Fuddle's phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce, who was originally called and notified about the order, and I told her we'd give her a call once we sort the issue out.

Sue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddle's order (Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine, which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go). Sue looks at me saying, ""So, if you eventually find this bedskirt, you'll have to mail it to us for free, right? I don't want to drive another 60 miles to come pick it up, and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow it's not."" I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them. Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leave.

Meanwhile, my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddle's original purchase... which has a queen sized bedskirt on it. ""She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store, and they left with her."" What could she have possibly ordered? We went back to the holds area. There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased... under Fuddle's neighbor Pierce's name and contact phone number... and it was unpaid for. I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadn't pulled out of the parking lot yet. They were gone. My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store. We're just hoping things will work out so we don't have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information. The neighbor does get a hold of Sue, she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friend.

**TL:** Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend. Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we can't track down the order that's supposed to be in store. The actual order wasn't a bedskirt, it wasn't paid for, and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer.

GrimGuy,29,,19,1r0zg2,,93,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

Fixer_,14,,19,1r8gem,,92,"**Background:**I work at a popular electronics/appliance store as a Computer &amp; Tablets Sales Consultant. I love my job. However, we get our fair share of nasty customers! 

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

At this point i offer to go get my supervisor, and the man accepts. I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown. At this point I don't interact with the customer again. Apparently, my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said. He (Being the awesome supervisor he is) refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price, saying ""Sir, it's mid November, we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on display.

According to my Sup, the man said nothing but ""I'll be back."" and walked out of the store. 

I'm not sure when he will be back, but I hope he isn't as big of an asshole next time!","""I'll be back!""",111,talesFromRetail
kemmer,37,,23,1rbkuk,,92,"Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino. I've worked at several other retail jobs since then, and the casino job is easily the worst I've ever had. The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money, and they took out that anger and frustration on us. Some stories...

**Orientation:**

Everyone that was starting work in the casino that week, no matter the job or department, took part in the same orientation. It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms, but it ended in a tour of the whole property. We saw the high roller suites, the ballrooms, all the restaurants, etc. While touring the steakhouse (the most expensive restaurant), the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available. He pulled out a bottle of one (I don't remember what it was now, probably Cristal or something like that), and told us how lucky we were to see it up close, because *none of us would ever be able to afford it*. It's been 7 years since I had that job, and the memory of that STILL pisses me off. I was 17 years old, that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make. Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers, there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting. It's been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu. Just for my own satisfication, you know? I should have known then this job was gonna suck.

**Counting:**

I'm not gonna front, I'm pretty bad at math. I'm fairly intellegent otherwise, graduated college with a 3.85 GPA, but I've just never been able to wrap my head around numbers. One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink. The order was something like $12.08. He handed me $13, I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him 92 cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter. I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now. It honesly couldn't have been more than 3 seconds that I hesitated, but in that time he started screaming, literally screaming, at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been. But he couldn't stop there, oh no, he had to *call his wife over* so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were. ""Can you believe it?! How can they hire people this dumb?!"" I had figured out his change in the meantime, handed it to him, turned around and sobbed over the chili. The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgust.

**Suicide:**

My most memorable day working at the casino, and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever. This place was essentially like Disneyland, in that there was a whole underground world for the employees. We had our own stores, our own bank, our own cafeteria, etc. To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli, we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing. The parking garage was right outside the deli doors. One day I was walking back to work after my break, when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage. I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground, mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids. I couldn't tell what was going on, but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli. Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage. They had already removed the body, but I got to see the remnants. The image of that will forever stick in my brain.

Those are my ""best"" stories, but that doesn't even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car, the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company, or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families (neither knew of the other). I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time. Those cookies were damn good.

TL;DR: Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth.

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

I tell her

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

I know it's not in back, it's not got a home and it's not even being carried at our stores. I look anyways and it's not there. I go back to her and explain that it's not in back and not carried at this store. I know what's coming up next, she sighs and tells me ""is there a manager around I can talk too?""

I tell her the Team Leader has gone home, and I'll have to call for a Manager to come and that would take a while since they are in a meeting.

Luca20,38,,24,1ragja,,87,"I work at a large retail store that sells mostly hardware and wood products.  I work in the lumber area with only male coworkers.  This means that most of my coworkers pretty much whip their junk out if a woman customer comes in. 
Last Saturday(we get lots of clueless DIYers on the weekend) a lady came in needing some molding cut to length.  This lady was so hot that I wanted to avoid looking like I'm showing her special treatment (most guys are guilty of this).. 
She was in her late 20's(I'm 21).  She was about 6'0"" had gorgeous blond hair, extremely dark brown eyes, and the ass was fat.  The only problem was she had these Gary Busey eyes.  She was clearly not normal.  She somehow seemed like the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" type.  The kind that will laugh manically at everything with eyes *really* wide open.  I did everything I could to just stay professional.
Eventually she finds the molding she wants and asks me to rip it........meaning to cut it lengthwise.  It's called ""quarter round"" you might have some in the room your sitting in right now http://www.paramount-floors.com/i/Quarter_Round_White_Oak_1.jpg this means to cut that piece into a 45 degree prism. ""You've got to be shitting me"" I thought.  ""Surely she's just trying to be funny, or fuck with me"".  She just stared back with her crazy Gary Busey eyes.  After 5 seconds of silence, I look up chuckling and say ""you know I really can't do that, right?""  She stands right up against me, chest now pressed on the back of my arm, ""gosh, this piece of molding, ripped, would be perfect for my project..""
""This bitch is crazy"" I thought"".  Cutting a piece of wood that tiny by hand will look ridiculous, no matter how hard I try. After quite some time of telling her that it will look like crap, she still insists.  So I get a Drimmel  http://toolguyd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Cordless-8300-01-Dremel-Multi-Max-12V-Oscillating-Tool.jpg and get to it, very, very slowly. 
It takes me about 40 minutes to rip the (2) 10.5 foot pieces of molding, and it still looks like it was cut by a drunken sailor.  I give them to her with a smile and a ""no problem"".  She thanks me and talks with me for about 10 minutes.  This lady is talking like she's known me for years, and it's making me a little uncomfortable.  She's hot, but a serious nutcase.. She isn't *just* being friendly and I'm not sure what she's getting at.
When she leaves, I see her pick up my card, and wink.  
I get a picture message from an unknown number that night.  It reads ""heyyy Luca20, that quarter round worked out really well!""  With a picture of her, showing a*lot* more chest, splintery jagged molding in the background.

ExcerptMusic,18,,13,1rahbf,,87," I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues. Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it. However, there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults.

 Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phone.

Keep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes. I am being as nice as possible on the outside.

I had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone. I knew it wasn't going to be fun to figure out because he had on the ""fuck you"" face and looked to be in the ""ignorant with technology"" age range. He presented me with 3 problems

1. My alarm doesn't alert me in the morning and I need it for work.

2. The outside keys don't lock so the phone turns the speaker on.

3. The battery runs out when I unplug it at night.

He then followed by ""I bought this phone 30 days ago and want to return it"" and ""I've been with this company for 10 years""

 Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the ""I've been shopping here for X amount of years""... This company doesn't care about you personally.. they just don't. This isn't some mom &amp; pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business. This is a multi-BILLION dollar company. They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those 10 years, because I guarantee this isn't your first time complaining. 

 So you bought the phone 30 days ago? Sorry you can't return it. There is a 14 day return policy on phones company wide. This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors (which doesn't happen). We could also get the manufacturer to replace it (if there is actually a problem with it). There was no problem with the phone so there is 100% nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone. So I check it out and explain to him what is going on.

 The alarm.. First off, his alarm was off. He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesn't work. I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdays(I did this for him). He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off 5 minutes after it was supposed to. I tested the alarm feature about 15 times. No issues. If it happened every time like he said, I would have seen it at least once. Even after telling him that the alarm was off, he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically. No. It wasn't. Next issue.

 The outside keys wouldn't lock. Ok. This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys. He also has a horizontal belt carrier. He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him, he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didn't do that. I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling. You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call. After talking more with him, I figured out why his old phone didn't have that issue. He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone. Next issue.

 The battery runs out at night. This one is just stupid... He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night, he unplugs it and leaves it open. The phone also has the screen timeout disabled. So at night, he unplugs the phone at 100%, leaves it open fully lit, and goes to bed. Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead. He must sleep with the lights on or something, I don't know. I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in (even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years). A problem with battery capacity in 2 years isn't going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because ""the phone dies at night"".

 Now that i've fixed his issues, he says that he will try it out but he doesn't expect it to work because it was the phone. 

 Sorry guy, it wasn't the phone. It was user error through and through. Don't blame technology for your mishaps. Technology isn't some black magic. 90% of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read. If the alarm says ""OFF"" then the alarm is off. It's that simple. 

 As much as I hate these people, I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues. It's almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door. I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it. Seriously, those are the best customers ever..

TL;DR- User error accounts for most errors.

LossPreventionSucks,24,,21,1rfcsa,,85,"This is my first time posting here, but I'll just warn you this can get a bit winded.  I've yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy, as my manager mentioned I should ""keep quiet"" about the whole ordeal.


Now... I work for a popular gaming store chain.  I'm sure you can guess which one.  I've heard the horror stories, however I've had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention Manager.

To start the day off, I had to open.  I went in about 15 minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch.  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in.  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didn't go over hours and he was totally fine with that.  Anyway... 2 minutes after walking through the door, a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling ""I'M HERE! LET ME IN!""  I ignore them for the first 5 minutes (I mean, gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and it's almost 2 hours before open).  I walk up to them and inform them we open at 10.  The man quickly snaps ""Bullshit! We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release!"".  So I texted my manager and, sure enough, he said ""Absolutely not.  If they're picking a system up, let them in, though.""  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with ""No, I want to return this stuff"" holding up at least $400 worth of XBox games and a system.  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down.  He finally agreed and left only to call every 2 minutes or so and ask if we were open, yet... For the next hour and a half.  Now, because this guy was so persistent, I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didn't have to wait for the 20 minute timer to go up.  I figured he'd come back right away.  That was my first mistake.  He never did come back and, due to us being so busy and me being the only one there, I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bit.


On to the second half... I was there alone all morning.  I had several people asking for systems, which require me to go through a locked door, through a hallway, and into another locked door to get to.  I have to do this for each system whether or not 3-4 people in line are waiting for a system.  This gives 5-10 minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store.  So what did I do?  I propped the first door open.  Mistake number two.


After a bit, my part-timer came in.  45 minutes after opening (I repeat, we were open for 45 whole minutes, at this point... 30 of which I had spent alone with nearly 30 customers in the store picking up systems)... In walks our Loss Prevention guy.  I didn't know he was Loss Prevention, though... No... He instantly walks in, starts yelling at my part-timer about the door, and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there.  Still no introduction, the following commenced:

FatLossPreventionMan:  ""Why the hell is the back door open?""

Me:  ""Can I help you?""

FatLP:  ""IS YOUR SAFE OPEN?  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING"" (remember, there's multiple people in the store at this point, several in line)

Me: *oh fuck*  ... stutter... stutter...""Yeah, there was an incident this morning where I had a return, but he never showed up.  I also needed to add change to the register""

FatLP: ""You can't do this.  Are you the manager?""

Me: ""No, may I ask who you are?""

FatLP: *beaming* ""I'm Dave.  I'm here to audit and help with customers"".

Me:  ""Okay.  Yeah, I messed up.  It's been a hectic morning.""

After this exchange, he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store.  Mind you... I'm not the manager.  I'm not even assistant manager.  I'm a store worker who gets paid 50 cents more than minimum wage with manager duties.  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs 7 feet in the air, saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them (I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how).  He then answered phones with just ""Hi, this is Dave"".  No greeting, nothing... Just... Dave.  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didn't know the answer... These people then called back so they could complain to me.


At this point, he had yelled at my coworker and I, loomed over us, and degraded us so badly that I was near tears.  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how ""pathetic"" this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing.  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I.  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on, giving no personal space.  The customer asks ""Are you okay?"" and Dave butts in ""She's fine... Do you want the GPG?"".  I said nothing... I was beaten and I couldn't do anything.  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about 90 different things that I had done that was a terminable offense.  I was afraid if I said anything more, that I would be done... And I need this job.  


Anyway... There's a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share (mostly from corporate), but this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.


TL;DR:  Shitty customers banging on the door.  I screw up. Loss prevention guy comes in to tell me how much of an incompetent human being I am, pushing me to tears.",Nothing like being degraded in front of the whole store to end the week. (This is long. I apologize ahead of time).,106,talesFromRetail

AdriValkyrie,41,,23,1r5ewi,,74,"I work in a restaurant in a fairly rich town, in the suburbs of a large city, and for some reason, people feel entitled to make that comment to me all the time. I'm a rather short (5'3""), and slim girl, so I definitely do not give off a ""strong"" vibe (I am much more so than most people think though, that type of job definitely can keep you in shape).

 Most of the time, it's older customers who seem almost worried for me, as in a ""are you sure that's not too heavy for you?"" when I'm clearing off a table. Yes, I can, otherwise I would not be carrying all of this, that would be silly. I appreciate the concern, but no need to make comments.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

One of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while I'm lifting it, and says ""You shouldn't do that! You're a girl! You're not nearly strong enough to do that!"" I just stared at him, then proceeded to dump the ice in the sink, and walked away, while he looked stunned. His friend, on the other hand, started shaking his head, embarrassed by his friend.

I just want to know how people think this is ok? Seriously, making comments about whether or not I can do my job is not cool, and please don't throw in sexist remarks either.

Just as commenting about my weight is not acceptable either. Would you comment about the fact that someone was overweight? No, you would not. So please don't comment on me, either.

Minja78,35,,18,1rgqvv,,78,"Preface, I sell cars in the Pacific Northwest.  This story occurred back in October.   
    
It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)     

Me, ""Mam for me to get you even a small percentage of these option I would need a time machine, what you asking for simply does not exist.""     
    
UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""    
   
Me, ""What your asking for doesn't exist, I think the closest you'll come is the new Tesla but I can't think of anything in the mainstream car world that's even close to half of your list.""

BuffHipster,5,,13,1r556k,,72,"Was suggested to cross post here from [this AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r2b9l/whats_the_most_insulting_thing_you_ever_said_to). My buddy destroyed an asshole customer with a solid one-sentence send off. Enjoy!

&gt;Not me, but my friend. He was at work, and apparently some asshole customer was berating a new employee, like new as in fresh out of training. This customer was a repeat offender to this type of stuff, people who work retail know the type. My buddy, having worked there for a year or two, comes up and tells the new employee, ""Go, I'll take care of this."" Before the customer can tear into him, he said in a quiet voice, ""Your business is not worth your bullshit and the world would be a better place without you.""

&gt;Customer left speechless.

So bonus post-story stuff, I guess... so far, my buddy hasn't gotten in trouble for it, which he totally could as he is not a manager. As for context, the customer was using profanity and being blatantly unreasonable. This poor new employee literally walked out of the training room to go the bathroom, and customer asked him a question, and then proceeded to ""How could you not know where this is?

abbeyinreallife,13,,18,1r1eap,,70,"I work in your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store, and I've had the job for around 2 months. For a majority of the time, I've been the designated punching bag (aka ""guest services"") in the store. I run the phones, announcements, returns, special orders, cashiering, complaints, etc. in my little box. 

Today was a surprisingly slow day, but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out. We had a line of maybe 6 or 7 parties, and I was checking people out along with 2 other cashiers. Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns. Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

*She went and grabbed one of our reusable bags*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

ME: ""..kay. Your total is [total]."" *she pays me in cash*

I had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change, but I restrained myself!

HER: ""That cashier is so nasty."" *leaves*

After closing, I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people ""oh you don't mind do you?"" as she pushed past, yelled at the cashier for ""blinding her"" with the red scanner light, and tried to get her to give her a discount without a coupon.

Needless to say, we were not sad to see her go.

Maloth_Warblade,6,,19,1rhx0y,,91,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,14,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

HeloRising,16,,15,1ra3ti,,64,"Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it, I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one I'd forgotten.

This was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day. Alas, the day was not to remain so. A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves. She smiled and I greeted her, asked her if she was looking for anything in particular, she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that. 

About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried. 

(Note the punctuation in her statement is very. very. deliberate.)

""Umm...I'm trying to decide on one of these It's for my daughter she's graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldn't have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I don't know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe that's a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe they'd go well in her new place but I don't know for sure what it looks like because it's all the way out past the freeway and--""

This goes on for quite some time. I'm overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything she's saying because it's coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesn't seem to want to slow down. I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned. After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesn't intend to stop. Like ever. 

At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security. This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stay-at-home moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasn't unheard of and it was starting to look like she'd either taken too much or too little of something strong.

By now she'd begun almost a full-blown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast. Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly. Also she'd stopped focusing on me, she was no longer looking directly at me anymore. She had this kind of ""thousand yard stare"" going on. 

Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting. Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point, spewing molten crazy on everything around her.

Just before the ten minute mark, she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out. We were watching a grown human being have a full-blown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shop...and we hadn't the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it. She'd gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice, unreasonably hot coworker told the security guard:

""A customer is having a nervous breakdown, what's the policy on that?"" 

It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression you'd expect on people's faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP; profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascination.

Eventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to just...staring off into space with her mouth slightly open. We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact, who I assume was her husband. He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store. He didn't explain what was going on, just thanked us for calling him and left with her. I never did see her again after that.

Part of me is amazed I'd forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it.

TaterSaladDelta,19,,24,1rcu4v,,64,"  So my brother manages a seasonal fireworks tent every year. He lets me work there and gives me a small cut of his final check. I usually just clean up/ring up the occasional customer. More often than not I'm just hanging out. This year we were pretty busy and the tent was packed. It was a few nights before the fourth of July and we were going nuts trying to keep up.

  That's when I saw him. **Bubby**. He looked like a normal guy, late 50's, hispanic, balding slightly. But he was far from normal. He wandered in with his oversized flannel and adidas slip-ons and started scanning the big assortments. Like $200 big. He had a different handler every night, most likely family, that would translate for him. 

  He decided he wanted the biggest thing there and was waiting in line. I was on bag duty and as I handed out bags I would occasionally glance up at each customer. I would catch a glimpse of him every time, one spot closer, ready to seal my doom. He'd do this disturbing thing with his mouth, sort of like [this](http://youtu.be/AFbYU1xpR9Q?t=6s) and stare me down. I knew I was in his sights. I was marked. He had me targeted and I wasn't getting away. 

  The line was going slowly and he didn't like that. He would crane his head up to look at me and point to his assortment, he would snap at me and motion to ""come here"". He didn't speak english but he would say ""bubby bubby bubby"". I could hear him over the roar of the other customers, beckoning for me to assist him. I just tried to ignore it and let him get bored of trying to summon me. Then he was next. 

  *Oh Shit*

  Until that moment I didn't know his translators couldn't translate for shit. He slams the assortment down and points to it like an expectant toddler. He then said something in English.

""Free for me?""

  **damnit**

  Like most customers that don't speak English, he had seen the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE banner with (selected items only) in small print and wanted his free fireworks. We tried to explain to him that he needs to buy a product marked for the deal but he wasn't having it. His eyes narrowed and his weird lip thing intensified. He pointed to the assortment again and his translator tried to help. I don't know what she said but he went into a rage so glorious I almost laughed right at him. 

  He started yelling ""**BUBBY BUBBY BUBBY, FREE FOR ME**"" and I thought he was about to chew his own lips off.

Arntown,20,,6,1r9n75,,65,"Just wanted to say I'm German and I might not be the best story-teller, especially in English. But here we go.


So, we're a clothing store and I usually don't have too many interesting stories to tell but this one from tonight was quite interesting.


It's pretty late and there are two guys checking out the accessoires. Both looked really fucked up. The first one had his eyes wide open and really grey skin and the other one looked like Skinny P from Breaking Bad.


So the first guy waves me towards him. He has a necklace in his hand and asked me if the symbol on it is a satanic symbol. I'm quite confused and just mutter ""uhhh, no"". He then tells me that ""Oh nonono, I'm no satanist, just askin', don't think that!""


And I'm like ""No worries, man""


Then he proceeds to put his hands into his trousers, fondling around in his ball-area. I just think ""Well, odd but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do""


He then pulls out 25‚Ç¨ which confuses the fuck out of me. He then starts grinning like a little child and proudly proclaims that he always keeps his cash by his junk.


I am reeeally confused right now and ask him if he gets regularly mugged. He then gets then tells me with this really serious tone in his voice: 


""I was mugged...by a raven."" And looks exactly like someone who thinks of a terrifying thing that happened in the past. 


I just stood there in silence, not sure whether to laugh or to be worried. And hoping that he won't pay with his junk-money.


He obviously doesn't have anything to say to me anymore so I go somewhere else to tidy up a little bit.


After ten minutes of checking out the satanic necklace he decides not to buy it and both are about to leave the store. 


But then he comes back in and walks up to me. He leans towards me and whispers into my ear 

""Are you able to organize some [verka] for me?"" 

I have no idea what he's talking about and ask him what that is. 


""It's a stimulant"" and he has that eyes-wide-open-look on his face again.


I just say ""uhh, no""


He then simply shrugs with his shoulders and leaves for good.

Crazy_Overlord,7,,5,1rej04,,64,"Our return policy is 30 days with a receipt (we're also a franchise, so *every* store has this rule). That should be simple enough, right? Apparently not when it's a month before Christmas...  
  
Up here in Canada, we don't really have a Black Friday, but corporate decided to get a couple of items *specifically* for this weekend. These items (big ticketed electronics, toys, etc) are **not** stock items and my boss has no intention of selling them after Christmas. Needless to say, cashiers made sure to emphasize the 30 day return policy (which is pretty generous considering that we're probably going to have to re-sell it for half the price).   
  
One particular lady took offense to this rule. As soon as my coworker mentioned the policy, this lady started **screaming**
 about how, ""this is ridiculous!"" and, ""What? You want me to shop **after** the 25th????"" My coworker patiently explained to the customer that these items were seasonal and that we don't normally stock them, but that still wasn't good enough.   
  
The woman started yelling for a manager. My coworker called my manager and confirmed with her on the phone that the 30 days was mandatory. This *still* wasn't good enough. My manager had to come to the front and explain to this woman that we have no control over the return policy and how corporate will not allow us to process returns at a later date. **Still** not good enough.  
  
This lady started demanding to speak to someone even *higher* up. My manager at this point was fed up with this idiot's rudeness and told her that our store manager (who was off today) would be in contact with her. My coworker quickly processed her transaction and tried to hurry her out the door.    
  
Of course, she managed to find someone she knew and spent the next 15 (I counted) minutes telling them about how *insane* our policies are (because of course *we're* the crazy ones here).

amylondon,21,,11,1rdnjq,,67,"Hi all, I no longer work in a betting shop, having left a couple of months ago due to the unpleasant environment, but I do have some stories from my time there. For the Americans, a betting shop would be called a sportsbook over there, and here they're generally known for containing the... not so nice members of society.

Anyway, here's one story I can remember, and I apologise, I'm not a very talented writer.

So I'm working with my colleague at around 9pm (we shut at 10). The shop is empty which is a rare and pleasant surprise. A man walks in and asks for money to be loaded onto one of the gaming machines. These are machines where you can play virtual roulette, slots etc. and the customers can put their money in themselves or we can do it from behind the counter if they're paying by card. Now, due to strict gambling laws and company policy, if they pay by card their winnings have to be returned to them back onto their card. This is to prevent fraud. 

The man comes up to the counter and quite rudely says he wants ¬£50 on the machine. I take his card and inform him before processing the transaction that any winnings will be put back onto the card he paid with. He does not like this at all, raising his voice to me saying it‚Äôs his money and he wants it back in cash. I say that‚Äôs not possible as its policy. He grumbles for a bit but accepts and plays his game. Two minutes later he kicks the machine and I notice he‚Äôs lost his ¬£50. He comes back up to the counter and wants ¬£100 to be put on this time, I again inform him all winnings are to go back onto the card (I have to for every transaction). He loses it. He starts screaming and shouting at me that I never told him that before. I tell him I did and he previously argued with me about it, and my colleague was next to me at the time and also heard it. He goes on a rant about how I now need to pay him his LOST money back and he wants a refund. He gave me the ‚Äòultimatum‚Äô of refunding his ¬£50 or letting him pay by card and get his winnings back in cash. What the fuck? You want me to give you back money you gambled away and lost? He was shouting at me saying I stole his money, he‚Äôs kicking things and he‚Äôs just generally losing his shit. I had to call the police as he refused to leave, and they escorted him out. They laughed when I told them what happened.

Best part? He was wearing his branded work uniform which is a fairly upmarket supermarket, and I had his full name from his card. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs still been kicking off since I left. May have to call his employers and let them know about their colleagues behaviour, after all, he *is* representing their company when he‚Äôs in his uniform.",Refund my money,78,talesFromRetail
BlueLily54,19,,13,1r5col,,65,"I don't know if anyone remembers my post from a few weeks ago, but [here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p4ejt/so_im_quitting_my_retail_job_today_ive_had_enough/)

I put in my two weeks notice at the big box pet retail store not long after I accepted a job as a teller at a local bank. I just wanted to share something that happened yesterday that was pretty much one of the most ridiculous things I've been asked. Not dramatic, just ridiculous.

So this older woman walks in the door and up to my register. She holds out her hand and says, ""Can you tell me what kind of treat this is?"" She's holding a single treat. No bag, no nothing. Just the treat. Coincidentally I had bought the same kind for my dog before, so I showed her exactly where they were. I made my way back to the register. 

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws).

biohzrd451,15,,13,1r61h1,,64,"Hello there first time poster long time reader. This is going back to the summer of 2001 when I was pulling a stint in a Mom and Pop pizza joint in a small town.

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box. I mean the dude threw a full on temper tantrum and slung his boxes across the counter making a huge mess.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

Over the past year and a half, I had many things happened, that I still cringe to this day. But far worst was yesterday. It was a typical afternoon, and a little old woman comes up to my register holding a very squirming puppy and some dog food. W is for woman, M is for me:

W- Can I put the puppy on the belt for just a moment while I get my wallet out and pay?

M- Yea sure, I'll turn off the belt. 


Now at this moment, the cute puppy poops and pees all over my belt. Like diarrhea bad. 

M-Ma'am, it seems like your dog has had an accident on my belt. Right there is a 'oops station"" where you can find some paper towels and baggies. 

W- ITS NOT MY JOB TO CLEAN UP AFTER MY DOG! ITS YOUR JOB. YOU GET PAID FOR IT!

M- Ma'am, you are responsible for your own animal, as I am responsible for my own. 

W- NO! NO! ITS NOT MY JOB, I DON'T WANT THIS FOOD, I'M LEAVING.

shadowmanwkp,12,,18,1r1q8g,,63,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around ‚Ç¨2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.
