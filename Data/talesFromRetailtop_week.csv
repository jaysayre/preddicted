I've been staring at the white walls of the video game store for about 2 hours since lunch. It was a very slow day, I glanced at the tables in front of the store,and my heart ache. It was the donation table for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda that wretched my country and even though I have donated what I can, I still feel sad whenever I saw the people on the TV suffering. 

I was broken out of my thoughts when the doors jingled open . Customers, finally!

She was a small girl, about 10 or 11 and a pink Hello Kitty backpack was at her small back. Her mother was accompanying her, a few plastic bags in tow. I recognized her mom. When I was selling cigarettes on the street, I see her peddling clothes she made herself on her stall at the market. She now has her own online shop and making a name for herself. 

The daughter just had a birthday and her mom finally has enough money to buy a PS3 and some games. 

The girl half-jogged, half-skipped to my counter. She opened her backpack and pulled out a console. Her mom handed me the bag full of games.

""Can I return this?""

""Sure sweetie, no problem.""

I inspected at the console and the games, and nothing was opened. Per policy, I returned the money to the mom. She handed the money to the girl, and she ran off as fast as her little feet can take her. I was about to ask when the mom, seeing my expression, explained.

""She wants to sell her birthday gift, so she can donate to the victims.""

I honestly teared a bit there. She was willing to give up what was supposed to be hers and gave to those in need. That's real generosity out there.

While I was watching her talking to the girl at the donations table, I was reminded that even though there are a lot of selfish assholes in the world, there's a person just like that little girl and I was happy.

Edit: Yolanda and Hayain are the same typhoon.

UPDATE: I was texted by my co-worker today and somebody is claiming that they are the mother of this story and now reaping in the rewards for their ""good deed"".

Personsen,445,650,1qvk5o,1621,"[](/lyranotsure)I'm not a huge fan of coupons in general. There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired, they don't scan, or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up (which is a pet peeve of mine). If you want to use one or two coupons, I am fine with that. I completely understand wanting to save some money.

But there is a trend that pisses me off to no end.  

""Couponers"".  

A lady came in a while back, with a large amount of deodorant in her basket. After I finished ringing her up, she said,  
""Oh and I have a few coupons...""  

She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse.  None of them having scannable bar codes, meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually. I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to.  

She notices I am reading them and says ""Yeah. Those should pay for the entire transaction.""  

""I'm sorry, it says limit one coupon per customer and that they aren't to be used with any other coupons."" I reply.  

""No. I did the math. I have enough here to cover the entire transaction. In fact, you guys should technically be giving *me* cash back."" she says with a chuckle.  

At this point the line was piling up again on my register, so I called up a third cashier and the manager.  

The manager comes up and asks how he can help.  

She says ""Yeah this guy won't let me use my coupons.""  

I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons can't be used like this.  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for free.

Before she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her. She says ""You should be expecting more of us.  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here. Next time just scan the damn coupons"" She then struts out the door with a smile.  

The manager was fired soon after.  ","Fuck. ""Couponers"".",2271
FredFltStn,207,490,1qz4m9,1231,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

JohnBlankets,209,341,1r4xut,1178,"I work 3rd shift at a particularly large employer of many many people. One fateful night, as I was attending my ""putting things on shelves"" duties, some teenaged kids came in and apparently started hiding some high dollar merchandise in the sporting good area. No one noticed this. Later, around 6 AM, the wind down of my night, these kids came back with shopping carts, running to where they hid all these items that they apparently absolutely could not live without. They grabbed all the stuff up and started booking for the door.  
The manager on duty, however, was having NO theft on his watch(mind you, this mountain of a man's nickname is ""The Punisher). He immediately chases after them and yells to the cashier on duty to ""Call the fuckin' cops!"". As he gets to the parking lot, they're speeding off in their getaway Sedona, but do you think that stopped the Punisher? No. As they're speeding off to retire in style after their successful heist, my SALARIED MANAGER proceeds to THROW A DAMN SHOPPING CART at their car, busting out their window.

metamaxwell,385,373,1r14xk,1092,"*So I may cry, I was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down, including the computer and now I have to type this again. That in itself may become another post*

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

FredFltStn,119,323,1r2ps1,952,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  We get our fair share of Spanish speaking customers at my location, and I try to have at least one cashier working that can speak Spanish, just to smooth things along. I don’t speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish). I was actually busy trying to stock one of the shelves at the time, so I shook my head no and held up one finger for the universal “one moment” sign. I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

About 10 minutes later, the two guys are shopping on the aisle across from where I was stocking, and talking to each other in Spanish. I’m really not paying much attention to them, when I thought I heard one of them say something like “She’s at the table, put it in the bag.”

I walk around the aisle, and one of the guys is holding a brick of firecrackers in one hand, and a large shopping bag from a different store in the other hand. I look in the other direction, and my cashier is at the front register checking someone out.

I walked up them smiling and said, “Bastardo barato, get out.”

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

CB: You said you would pay cash to get my car fixed

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

**STORY:**  I love fireworks. I got into the business because I love fireworks. I spend my vacation from my real job selling fireworks in a parking lot because I love fireworks (that, and it pays really well). I spend months researching fireworks, attending firework demos, and watching videos of new fireworks. Please don’t walk into my business and try to talk shit to me.

One of my employees grabbed me and asked me for some help. He had been showing a guy around the tent, and the guy was asking some questions that he couldn’t answer. He was apparently also kind of being a dick about it.

I walked up the to the guy and introduced myself.

**ME:** Andy told me you had some questions. Is there anything I can help you with?

**GUY:** Yeah, I was looking for some good stuff, but you guys don’t carry anything good.

Note to potential shoppers, if you’re looking to piss me off, this would be the way to do it.

**ME:** If you’re talking about legal fireworks, I carry some of the best stuff imported into the US. Is there something specific that you’re looking for?

**GUY:** I usually shop at &lt;other company&gt;, I just thought I’d stop by to see what you had, but their stuff is definitely better. I wanted to pick up some mortars, but I guess I’ll have to make the trip to the coast.

**ME:** Really? What mortar pack are you planning on getting?

**GUY:** I always get &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars. They’re definitely the best you can buy in the US. I'm not surprised that you don't have them, since you're just a tent.

**ME:** Wow, you have shitty taste in mortars, and those definitely AREN’T the best in the US. Hell, they’re not good enough for me to carry in my store.

**GUY:** You have no idea what you’re talking about.

**ME:** Really. &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars are imported by the Beihai Kylin Fireworks Co, located in the Guangxi province of China. Of course the fireworks are actually made in one of hundreds of factories located in Liuyang, a province of Hunan. It’s a 1 ¾ inch diameter 48 gram canister shell. Sadly, it only gets about 125 ft of lift out of the tube, because they skimped on the lift charge. 

**GUY:** But…

**ME:** The shells are also hand packed, rather than machine packed, which probably explains why the breaks aren’t symmetrical. That means it was made at an older factory. That’s probably why they sell them so cheap and will put any label you want on them. Then again, it’s only a 48 gram shell…and not even the best 48 gram shell that Beihai Kylin imports. 

**ME:** If that’s really the type of stuff you’re looking for, I probably won’t have anything you’d like. Thanks for stopping by.

I turned around and walked away from the guy.

He actually did end up shopping for a while, and picked up a lot of stuff from me. Sadly, he didn’t have any other questions for me.

However, I'm loaded with great customer stories. 

----

My current workplace, we're just generic retail, and deal a lot in pop culture. There are several clothing items and decoration-y things relating to different fandoms, movies, games, etc, but we also carry generic clothing items, sweatshirts, hoodies, pants. This story, is about pants. 

A few nights ago, got a kid (probably 11-12) and his mom in looking at some Doctor Who things, and he's decked out in buttons, keychain Tardis, and a Tardis shirt. I knew this kid and I would be friends, as an avid Whovian, so I walked over and told them about the sales, and asked him who his favorite doctor was. Bam, sales-win. 

Normally I try not to stay with a customer the whole time, because I don't want to be pushy, but this kid kept asking questions, so I kept answering. Ended up getting him in the dressing room to try on a shirt, after about 15 minutes. While we walked back in my tiny store to the one dressing room, his mom noticed the 'Wall of Pants' and exclaimed, 'MYGOODNESS, 26"" WAISTS!?'. She grabbed one, and brought them along with her. 

I love selling denim, it's eaaaaaaaaaasy. 

Ended up, she grabbed a pair of super duper skinny jeans, and the poor kid was like 'I can't, I can't feel my legs.' While I wandered off to find a pair of regular cut, she was telling her son to put his regular pants back on. I came back up, with two different styles and colors. Mom yells into fitting room 'TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF RIGHT NOW!' and I couldn't help but smile, and kind of laugh. 

I try not to have these reactions, often, although sometimes there are several moments during the day I could, and the mom caught me. I thought I was in trouble, based on the look on her face, but instead, she went on to embarrass her son a little more. 'BUT, IF ANY OTHER GIRL EVER TELLS YOU THAT, YOU PULL YOUR PANTS UP RIGHT THEN....'

I had to walk away,... because laughs.

I did end up coming back to them and she bought two pairs of jeans and several shirts, and even complimented me on my customer service. As they left, she stayed back and told me, 'I have to embarrass him as much as I can now. He's getting too old, too fast.' ","When Mom says, 'Take your pants off,' she means it.",948
JizzBeef,179,161,1qutuf,713,"Today at my gas station job a woman came in to get some cigarettes. Now we have a policy (and also it's kind of the law here) that if we think you look under 40, we need to see your ID. I know it may seem a little odd, but w/e, I do it cuz in the slim chance I sold alcohol or tobacco to a minor I'd be fired, fined, revoked of my liquor license,  and I think I'd see time in jail as well. So anyway, this lady looks like she's maybe 20 or 30, but I've seen people that look older but their ID shows a different story, so I ask her for her ID anyway. Our exchange goes like this:

Me: may I please see your ID?

Lady: I don't have it, but I'm over 18

Me: I can't sell you cigarettes without seeing your ID, it's against company policy

Lady: I know that! But I don't give a shit. My year of birth is 1986!

Me: lemme see that on your ID.

Lady: look, I told you I don't have it! This is bullshit... can't you just get somebody that works here everyday to confirm my age? I'm a regular here, I come in here like 3 times everyday for the past six months!

I turn to my manager, then I remember two things:

1. My manager is new, and he only works on the weekends

2. I work everyday, and this lady is just a fucking idiot.

So then I tell her, ""mam, I've worked here just about everyday for over a year now and I've never once seen you. I can't sell you cigarettes unless you show me your ID to confirm your age, I'm sorry, but it's also the law. I'm not willing to lose my job over you.""

The lady looks at me all pissy, and obviously embarassed as she has caused a line and everyone was dead silent listening to our conversation,  so she turns around sharply and yells ""fine! This is fucking bullshit but I'll be back with it!""

The rest of the buffet is prepped and served at 11am (pizza, enchiladas, etc), sometimes a bit earlier. 

On this particular day I had just opened up the front doors and was placing out the display stands with todays lunch and special offers when a guy showed up and walked past me into the restaurant. I said Hi, which was ignored, he just continued. Ah well, everything was done at the entrance, so I went back to the cash register (its just to the right of the buffet) and waited for him to come over since he was busy with looking over the menu on the wall and the food serving area. He comes over almost immediately and he does not look happy.

""Where's the fucking buffet?!""

(What?) ""Well sir, the buffet opens at 11am, it says so on the sign hanging right above it, so its about 45 minutes left before it opens.""

""But I want the buffet right now! Why isn't it prepared yet? There's lot of people in the kitchen, cant they work faster?""

""As I explained, it opens in 45 minutes, if we put the pizzas out there now they might sit for over an hour before anyone shows up for lunch, and thats not particularly appetizing, is it? And some of the other food is not done yet. We want to serve them as fresh as possible at all times. But our whole menu is available and so is the rest of the lunch menu."" 

""But I want the buffet! It opens at 11am?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Well, I'll come back then but I want a discount!""

""What?""

""I want a discount on the buffet because you were unable to serve it to me when I wanted it.""

(Seriously?) ""I'm afraid I can not give you a discount on the buffet, sir, its already a price reduced offer and I can not make any form of discount on them, the cash register even denies it.""

""But I want a compensation for not getting my food! It is very rude to refuse a customer service! Is your boss here?""

""Sir, I am not refusing to serve you food, I am simply explaining that the food is not yet ready and that you are very welcome to come back in 30 or so minutes when its all done.""

""Well, fuck you then..."" 

He did not come back at 11.... ","Being to early AND rude will not get you anywhere, sir...",862

It was a loop. 

It was a loop of anger and death as I died for what seems like the 100th time in Volgarr the Viking. My phone rang as I died one more time, by that stupid bee.

Welcoming the break to my endless hell, I did not expect a text from my boss as this was my day-off. Dreading an emergency ""get yo' ass here this minute"" text, I tapped on it. 

""Check your FB. I sent you a link.Someone's pretending to be [The mother's name from Birthday Girl]"". the text read.

I closed the game and went to my Facebook, thinking somebody is reaping in the real life Karma for something that they shouldn't deserve. I was right and much more. It pissed me off. 

Mrs. B has a daughter that games and just had a birthday, but she isn't the Birthday Girl. I never saw Mrs. B in the shop, ever and I was pissed of by what she is doing. She was claiming that she and her daughter are in the story and ""was happy someone wrote about her."" People who was happy about their ""deeds"" and her daughter has been given toys, games and even a new PS3.

I wrote on the comments that I was the OP of the story and I will link this thread to the comments.

GreenEyedDemon,107,175,1qtb0s,564,"I've been lurking here for a while, and decided to post a story from my minimum wage slave job. I'm a cashier at a gas station just off a highway that runs through my state, so I get assholes from all walks of life. From the man who's impatient because I'm not counting his $5.07 in pennies for cigarettes fast enough, to the woman who demands I pump her gas for her because it's a bit windy out. This story happened about a month ago.

It was myself and a new-ish guy alone for the 4-12 shift. This guy was new enough to require some supervision for certain things (money orders, prepaid cards, phone cards, etc.) but there long enough to be capable of being alone for five minutes while I do my chores. Well, I'm outside doing trash and there's a few people in line inside but not enough for me to have to run in. I'm happily picking up peoples refuse from the overfilled bins, when I hear a regular customer yell my name out the door and say ""Green, (new guy) needs you"". I drop my stuff and go in and there's about 3-4 people in line behind a guy wanting a pre-paid card specific to the gas brand we sell (rhymes with hell). These take a minute to do, so I ask him to wait and open my register and get all the other customers out the door. After, I motion him to my register and he asks for a $50 station card.

I grab one and I'm getting ready to activate it, but I tell him I need to see the cash before I activate the card (as is our store policy). He says ""I'm not paying cash, do it as credit"" and puts his credit card on the counter. Oh boy, I know where this is going.

Me: Sorry sir, but I can't use credit or debit cards for purchasing a prepaid card.

Him: Are you kidding me? I've done this hundreds of times at different stations.

Me: Sorry sir, our store policy is cash only for prepaid cards.

Him: This is bullshit! I've been waiting for fifteen fucking minutes (closer to five) and you won't sell it to me?! I'm going somewhere else, you lost my business!

Me: Sorry, have a nice day.

He leaves, and I'm telling my coworker (this was his first experience with a mean customer) to ignore the assholes, the regulars make it worth it. I look down and what else do I see but the douchebags credit card. I look out and see he's just now leaving his pump. Normally, I'd run out and give it to them, but oh no, it appears I need to hang this card back on the rack and by the time I've made sure it's nice and straight, he's left. It's a company card, so I know he'll be back.

Hours later, near the end of my shift he walks back in, looking much more sheepish than earlier.

Him: Hi, uh, I was in here earlier and tried to use my card to pay for a gift card, did I leave it here?

Me: Yes sir, you did. Here you go! (I hand it to him with a nice smile).

Him: Sorry about going off the handle about that, I know it's not in your power to change the policy. I'll be going, thank you for holding it.

Me: No problem, have a great day!

nodnarb232001,130,134,1qy1mf,531,"A little background- This is my first post here (and on Reddit itself), so, be gentle.
I've worked fast food for the better part of a decade now and make it a point to deliver the best customer service possible (and am frequently complimented by customers on that). In that time, I've seen some crazy displays of the unimpressive parts of human behavior. The following is one of those times.

Working the cashier window, taking orders, taking money, generally going through the day like normal, when a customer hands me a Food Stamp card (they're called something else here, but I'll just refer to them as Food Stamp cards) to try to pay for their food. The total is hovering around $15-16.
In this state Food Stamp cards cannot be used for anything at restaurants, and our registers will flat-out decline the card if it's scanned. There is no way to circumvent that. I have the following exchange with the customer, whom I'll call Cheap-Ass Bitch (CAB).

&gt;Me- I'm sorry, we can't take that card.

&gt;CAB- *smugly* Oh? Why not?

&gt;Me- Food Stamp cards cannot be used to buy food that's prepared for you.

&gt;CAB- No, you can take it. I buy food here with it all the time!

&gt;Me- Ma'am, the register itself declines the card and I can't make it take it.

&gt;CAB- You CAN and you WILL!

(By this time, a sizeable line has formed in drive-through and I can hear people elsewhere in the store 
shouting back towards me that the line isn't move...as if I wasn't aware...)
&gt;Me- Ma'am, we legally cannot accept that card and have no way of using it. Do you have any other way to pay?

&gt;CAB- I AM THE CUSTOMER I PAY YOUR SALARY AND YOU WILL USE THE CARD!!!

(At this point, I'm fed up and have a rare moment where I start to snap)

&gt;Me- Ma'am, do you know how that Food Stamp card works?

&gt;CAB- YOU WILL RUN

&gt;Me- (Cutting her off) That Food Stamp card is funded by tax dollars. MY tax dollars. No. You're not ""Paying my salary"" by trying to use that card, since part of it is the money that I paid into the system through taxes. Now, please, do you have any other method of payment?

&gt;CAB- *taken aback at this uppity fast food drone standing up to her, and sputtering* Fine. Here. *thrusts a $20 at me*

&gt;Me- *takes it, cashes her out* Have a nice day.

tl;dr- If you plan on trying to commit Food Stamp fraud on someone who isn't having it, don't try to play the ""I PAY YOUR SALARY!"" card.

EDIT: Formatting derps. Forgot a word here or there.

EDIT THE SECOND: Just to be clear, I've got nothing against the Food Stamp program itself. It's a necessary program that helps feed so many families and keeps the economy afloat, especially in poor areas. People abusing the system, though, rustle my jimmies something awful though; and ones trying to abuse the system AND try to bully me into cooperating through twisted unlogic can get bent.","""I PAY YOUR SALARY!""...with my-tax-money-funded Food Stamps?",665
AAEmmerson,64,65,1r7jes,484,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about £4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

TL:DR Man wastes lots of grilled sandwiches, starts cussing us out, we get him thrown of his flight for aggressive behavior. All for a bacon sandwich.

HeloRising,41,72,1qvprn,394,"This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you. The last one took off so I figured I'd throw another one up.

***

I was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door. This wasn't strictly unusual, sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends. These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear, though, and all whiter than bleached snow. A little odd but this was in an *incredibly* white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall, it wasn't unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given day.

So 3Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces (a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes). I greeted them but they didn't take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes later.

""Yo...Yo man...you got like any frogs?"" 

""Frogs? Yeah we've got a couple of different ones, they should be up on that shelf"" 

""Naw dawg, I saw those ones. But I'm lookin' for somethin' special. Somethin' *gangsta*.""

I stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a ""gangsta"" frog looked like. I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker, thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the new(ish) guy. She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for *reals*, yo.

I told him to hold on and I'd check in the back. I went back where another employee was finishing up glazing.

""Hey...I don't know our whole stock yet. Do we have anything back here that we don't have out there?"" 

""A couple of things, why what'd they ask for?""

-long pause- ""A gangsta' frog.""

""....the fuck is a ""gangsta' frog?""

""I have no idea. Do we have anything that meets that criteria?""

""We've got one with a big chain, give him that.""

We did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to him.

""Yeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii! That's what I'm *talkin'* 'bout! 'Dat's the *shit* right there!""

So he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery. His cohorts also selected figurines, Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose. From listening to their back-and-forth, these were suitably gangsta' choices for various reasons.

As they were painting, my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song (they had, in fact, begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working with).

They took about an hour to finish their pieces. I wouldn't have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously. We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on *at length*, though I'm not positive how a springing lion can look ""straight outta Compton.""

Once they finished, they paid with credit cards (not as gangsta as a wad of cash but *way* easier for me to deal with) and left. Last I heard, they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap. To their credit, they weren't half bad at it.

Antics aside, they were actually very nice and never gave us any static. Never even heard the ""n"" word out of them (which was sadly very common with the hip-hop kids, especially the white kids).",They want gangsta' frogs.,466
Rubychan11,81,92,1qwqa2,389,"Short and so-not-sweet one here... I just got a call from one of my coworkers. She was in tears, her voice barely a whisper. Her mother had just recently gotten back surgery, so she had fresh stitches. Well, apparently the mother is very independent, doesn't like to admit she needs help, so she went to take a shower on her own. Biiiiig no no. The poor thing slipped and fell, opening the stitches and knocking her unconscious.

So of course, they take her to the ER. My coworker calls the manager and tells her what happened, saying please can she be excused from her shift--mind you, she's giving at least 4 or 5 hours' notice, and I would think this would be considered an emergency. Plus it's Monday... we are so not busy on Mondays. Surely they'll let her off, right......?

Nope. The manager says that if she doesn't come in, she'll get written up. So she calls me and asks if I could switch shifts with her (her 8 hour for my 4 hour) and of course I said yes, but I'm boiling mad at the manager.

Is that even allowed? Isn't there some sort of extenuating circumstance if a close family member is in the hospital? It's just like... what the fuck?!

AckAckADack,67,56,1qxzyy,362,"Long time reader first time posting. I devoted the better part of a decade to a company that sells guitars and thinks it's the center of the universe so my tale originates there. If you guys like, I'll put more up. Here goes. 

So one day whilst working a shift as the pro audio department manager, an attractive lady walks in and begins to look around. My slightly new co-worker K engages her and she's talking about she is interested in becoming a DJ. No problems there. K comes and asks me to assist him in closing the sale, not a problem. We get her into a very nice introductory setup - everything's cool. K begins ringing her up and announces the total - $1200. Lady doesn't even blink at the amount and pulls out a wad of cash. K looks at me with a bewildered look ""Ack, I've never seen that much cash before."" Me being used to dealing with large cash transactions, I just told him to make sure he counts it properly and drops it in the safe. He begins to count the money and is looking very nervous. I stand next to him and ask what's going on. ""Ummm Ack, this is a lot of cash."" I look at him then at the customer and immediately figure out why he's nervous. (In a lot of cases at our store, when folks pay large amounts of cash they tend to be involved in not so legal activities but money is money and as long as the sale gets made, I don't ask questions.) He's making the assumption that she's potentially a drug dealer. I begin to figure out ways to not make the situation any more tense when the customer speaks up and says ""Don't worry, it's not drug money, I'm a stripper."" I bust out laughing while K turns a very bright red. 

TL:DR Customer pays large amount of cash, it's assumed to be dope money when in fact it's stripper tips.",It's ok. I'm a stripper,418
Dhenn004,42,81,1qr32l,353,"I've posted here before, and I mentioned I was a Movie theater shift manager. And I apologize this may get long.

Anyways to the story. It's Friday night, and it's busy, Thor came out last week and Catching Fire is next week so pre orders and Thor are making it absolutely nuts. It's also bringing the worst out of my employees (rightfully so, they are stressed) and the customers.

Anyways I digress. At our concessions we offer a free refill for MEDIUM and LARGE drinks and popcorn. It's to beat our competitors because they only offer on Large. Now, typically people who come out with a small and want it refilled I offer to let them pay the difference from a small to a medium and switch their cup for them. It's like 50 cents and most people accept. Not Today, Not this customer.

So this man comes out and wants a refill. My assistant manager politely tells the man that she is sorry but only MEDIUMS and LARGES get refills. 

**asshole:** ""Well one of your employees said I get refills.""

**Assistant Manager:** "" I'm sorry but our policy states-""

**Asshole** ""What, I don't care about your policy I want a refill"" At this point I hear him raising his voice so I start to walk over. But he just throws his cup on the floor and walks away before I can try to defuse the problem.

I shout across the lobby "" Come on man! We work hard to keep this place clean!"" Basically to make him guilty. (if it were even possible). I pick my Assistant up with the ""he's an asshole"" speech and we figure its over with.

Jump about 10 to 15 minutes later. We get a complaint about a man in a theater being loud and talking. With the same description of the man we just dealt with. I sigh and go in and stand in the corner so I can assess the situation without him seeing me. (If I'm seen, most of the time people stop right away and don't make a noise). I hear him and see him talking in the corner. It's the asshole.

I make my rounds, I walk up both set of steps make it seem like I'm not there for him. I walk to his side and stop a couple of rows behind him. He's still talking. I walk up to him and whisper for him to please be quiet. He stops talking for, I don't know, no more than 30 seconds? I ask again. Nothing is working on this guy!

He continues and I once a gain tell him to be quiet with a firm voice. Also I include the I will have you escort you out if you don't keep quiet. He just laughs right in my face. So I tell him to leave immediately.

**asshole:** "" make me HAHAHAHA"" Now this is getting the attention of everyone in the theater. 

**Me:** "" I have no problem calling the police, sir""

**Asshole:** "" Go ahead I'm not doing anything wrong""

**Me:** "" yes you are, you are disturbing everyone's movie experience, I've done this before and the police will be on my side on this""

**Asshole:** "" yea okay whatever, bitch.""

 I radio up to my assistant who has been right behind the projector upstairs and tell her to pause the movie. I announce to the crowd saying I'm sorry for the disturbance but I need to stop the movie so they don't lose their experience and miss out on the movie. (The whole point of me doing this is to call him out, maybe embarrass him). Well it worked but not in the way I expected.

I stands up and I see him ball his fist and bucking up to me. Typically in a business situation you can't fight back or do anything. I wasn't looking to fight this man so I back up to put some space between this guy and myself. He starts moving towards me, and I quickly as possible Radio up and tell my assistant to call the city police department. (911 wasn't needed).

He lunges at me so I just back up as quickly as possible. I'm a pretty quick guy so I easily just moved out of the way. But he tried to get even closer and pushed me. After that it was on baby! Actually not really, he pushed me and I just grabbed him by the neck and held him in a position so that he couldn't do anything. 

I asked him if he was done but he was just getting furious. He tried dipping out before the police showed but I was prepared and had the doors locked so if something like this were to happen I could keep him in the theater. He ended up hiding in the bathroom until the cops showed up. Several police asked other movie goers what happened. Let me off with a pat on the back and said I did the only thing I could do to stop him and arrested him. 

TL/DR: I channeled my inner bruce lee and put him in a headlock.

works_in_a_pet_store,62,66,1qybg3,325,"ANTICLIMATIC UPDATE:

Well I got an email back this morning from our customer service rep telling me that the woman had called.  However, she is no longer in charge of customer service calls, and redirected the call to a brand new office.  I have not heard anything further about the situation.  We hadn't heard about it yet because it literally was being announced that afternoon during a conference call.  I asked my store manager to let me know if we got an email back from this new office, but there was nothing in the email today.  If I hear anything, I'll be back here with an update.

BACKGROUND:

As my username suggests I work in a pet store.  A corporately owned pet store, to give you a little more insight.  I'm a shift supervisor, and so I tend to close by myself and it then becomes my job to handle the majority of customer service issues.  



I'll also preface this story by explaining that our store has a new ""no complaints"" policy.  Corporate has been receiving too many customer calls that are complaints that corporate feels should have been handled at the store level.  The manager staff has been told that we are to do whatever it takes to keep a customer from calling corporate.    I could probably write a whole post about how I die a little bit inside each time I have to give a discount to somebody who in any other store would be told to hit the road. 



I'll also mention right now, if we weren't under this new ""no complaints"" policy, I would have asked her to shop elsewhere about 30 seconds into this whole ordeal.  Then again, I guess I wouldn't have this story if I had...

THE STORY


So I was doing my nightly rounds of the store, making sure everything looked nice and neat when I ran into Eighteen Dollar Lady (EDL for the rest of the story)... 

Me: Hi there, are you finding everything you need ton-

EDL: As a matter of fact, I've found what I needed, but I've got something to say to YOU. 

Me: Sure, what can I help you with? 

EDL: You can explain to me why this dog food is so damn expensive here.

------


I'll interject here quickly - she had a 12 lb bag of [Wellness Core Original Dog Food](https://www.google.com/search?q=wellness+core+orignial&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS527US527&amp;oq=wellness+core+orignial&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3211j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=93&amp;espv=210&amp;q=wellness+core+original&amp;tbm=shop).  This is a fairly high end food.  In our store it runs for about 35.98 dollars for that size bag.  The reason the price is so high is because they use high quality proteins in their food, and they use several other ingredients with higher nutritional value instead of a filler like corn.   I attempted to explain all of this to her, but I didn't get a word out...

Me: Well it's a - 

EDL: (begins yelling out of nowhere) YOU KNOW, I NEVER COME HERE ANYWAY.  I ALWAYS SHOP AT ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location"".  THEY HAVE THIS FOOD FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS THERE.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

HOW CAN THEY HAVE THE SAME SIZE BAG FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  HOW COME YOU ARE CHARGING SO MUCH.

*there's no way the other store charges that for this bag of food...our cost for it is around 25 or so bucks to begin with, and no store would sell it for below cost*

*ok, breath.  ok maybe I can offer her a price match.  yeah!  that's what she wants right?  yeah!  ok.  ok, I can still come out of this on top...  just got to wait for her to stop yelling.*

Me:  M'am I'm sorry to hear that, but do you perhaps have a reciept or an ad showing their price?  I don't set the prices here, but I can offer you a price match if you have - 

EDL:  WHO THE HELL CARRIES AROUND THEIR DOG FOOD RECIEPTS?

Me: Well, if you give me a moment, I can look up ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location""'s number and verify their price. 


EDL: NO.  I shouldn't have to go through all that just to get the right price!  IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  WHY ARE YOU SO GREEDY.

*what the...*

Me:  Again, I'd be happy to give you the food for that price, but in order to ring an actual price match on the register I need some sort of verification that the same product is that price at the other store...

*and that's pushing it, we're not really supposed to go below cost to make a bitch like you happy.*


EDL: NO, I WANT AN EXPLANATION.  I WANT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR FOOD IS 36 DOLLARS AND THEIR FOOD IS 18 DOLLARS.

Me:  Well, as I mentioned before, this is fairly high end food.  They use a lot of high quality ingredients, so it's more expensive to make.  But you are getting a very good quality food for the money.

EDL:  NO. THIS FOOD ISN'T THAT GOOD.  IT'S NOT HIGH END IF IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AT THE OTHER STORE.  DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

*SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Don't call me a liar.  If you want your damn food for 18 dollars, go to the other damn store. Please, just swear at me so I can kick you out...*

EDL:  WHO DO I HAVE TO CALL TO GET THIS ANSWERED.  WHO?

Me:  Well, I'm a shift supervisor, so if you'd like, the next point of contact is my manager who will be in tomorrow...

EDL: NO.  I WANT SOMEBODY HIGHER UP.

*Crap.  We're not supposed to let them call corporate until we've done everything at the store level to keep them happy.*

Me: Well, I'll tell you what.  I think I can scrape together a few store coupons to take about 15 dollars off your bag .

*I died a little bit inside saying this, by the way.*

Me:  Would that be ok with you?

EDL:  NO.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT A DISCOUNT.  I JUST WANT A NUMBER TO CALL.  YOU CORPORATE BIG BOX PET STORES ARE SO GREEDY.

*side note, I don't work for either of the two stores that probably come to mind when I say big box store.  It's a corporate store, yeah, but we've only got about 150-200 stores total. We're actually cheaper compared to the other two big pet stores that probably come to mind*

Me:  M'am, I don't set the prices.  I can give you a number for our customer service representative, and I can give you some coupons to bring the price down a lot more than I quite honestly should.  

EDL:  NO.  I WANT WHOEVER SETS THE PRICES.

*Fucking seriously?  Nope.  She's not getting anything other than our CS rep.*

EDL: M'am I don't have that information, I can give you the number for our customer service rep, and if she's not able to help you out, then she will give you the number of somebody higher up.  

EDL: Fine.  



We get up to the register.  I find a few store coupon PLUs that we have to use in situations like this.  It's meant to be a last resort, that maybe, just maybe if a customer sees the price come down that much, they won't call corporate.   

Even though I know she's going to call corporate anyway,  I still give her the coupons off,  I think because all that will happen if I don't do it, is corporate will fucking send her a $25.00 gift card ""for her troubles"".  Because to them, she's one more customer that will spend money in our store, so let's give her 25 bucks now to keep her coming back...all about that bottom line for them.


She finished her transaction and left the store. 


Knowing that she's going to call corporate, I now had to write an email to the customer service rep, detailing the whole incident.  


And then I had an idea.


I pulled out the yellow pages.

I looked up that privately owned pet shop that was about 20 minutes away from us.


I called them from my cell phone, pretending to be a customer.


 
Asked them if they had Wellness Core Original in the 12 lb bag, and what the price was if they did.
 
The guy came back on the phone after checking. They do not carry a 12 lb bag at all of that brand.  They carry the largest size 25 lb.  It's 55.99.

Our price on our 25 lb bag is 52.98.  We're cheaper than them.  WE'RE CHEAPER THAN THEM.  I pretty much was dancing at that point. 



I won't know how everything went down on the corporate end of things until tomorrow.  I'm praying and praying that they tell her to shove it,  because I REAAAAAALLLY wanted to.  And I'm hoping that maybe this particular nutcase makes them rethink their ""no complaints"" policy...

yohtin,39,71,1r052q,307,"I used to work at a hotel as a night auditor (overnight front desk guy). It was mostly pretty safe, but every now and again a homeless person would sneak into the building and try to sleep or steal food from the breakfast room. I quit and got a new job for a lot of reasons, mostly related to the fact that my manager was a terrible human being. This was the straw on the camel's back, though. 

One night I was delivering muffins to the breakfast room and was going to make coffee. At about 4am I found and confronted a homeless guy and asked him if he was a guest. He said ""I'm tired of people asking me that question"" and unsheathed a big knife. I dropped the muffins, ran downstairs and called the police. They showed up right away and he was already gone, but had stolen a bunch of the muffins. We had security cameras so I gave them a description of the guy and my manager's number so she could send them the footage.

A few days later, my manager called me into her office, and before asking me if I was ok, she passive-aggresively showed me the security footage of the homeless guy stealing the muffins. She said that she understood why I ran away but I should have taken the muffins with me, because now they were going to be short on muffins for the week. I acknowledge I could have picked the muffins back up and ran with them back downstairs, but not getting stabbed kind of took precedent at that moment.

So, yeah, the moment I realized my manager gave more of a shit about breakfast muffins than whether or not I got stabbed was a big reason I quit. I have a new job (day job) and am way happier now, good riddance to that place!",Breakfast muffins vs. me getting stabbed. Hmmmm yeah not really a choice at all...,378
Cosmic_Hitchhiker,85,69,1r82al,402,"So, as you may know, thanksgiving is next week Thursday. In traditional style many people are buying their frozen turkeys in hopes that they will thaw by next tursday and of course, stores have begun handing out coupons that will alter the price/pound for said turkeys. At our store it is written AND HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW on the coupon that you *must* buy $25 worth of groceries outside of the turkey to get the discount. I've had this ""discussion"" several times already, answers vary but it's always the same basic talk and I'm honestly considering leaving my job at a grocery store because of it.


Customer: C.      Me: M

Me: hi there find everything alright today?

C: yes, I'm only buying my turkey today and I want to use this coupon.

M: well, sir/ma'am, you have to spend $25 without the turkey before you can use this coupon. 

C: well, I spent $200 the last time I came I , I'll just bring in my last receipt and you can give me the discount.

M: no, I can't. You need to spend $25 on this order to get the coupon.

C: well I spend more than $25 every time I come here!!! Ill bring this reciept when I get the rest of my thanksgiving stuff!

M: *no* you *need* to spend $25 on *this order* if you'd like to use the coupon.

C: WELL I SPEND $200 HERE ALL THE TIME I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND $25 RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS COUPON! I WANT YOUR MANAGER! I DESERVE TO USE THIS COUPON BECAUSE I SHOP HERE ALL THE TIME. 



M: ok. Hey &lt;manager&gt; 



&lt;manager&gt;: what's the problem



M: she/he would like to use this coupon



&lt;manager&gt; well did she/he get $25 worth of other groceries?



M: nope.



&lt;manager&gt; then you may not use this coupon.

A little back story I'm 17 looking for a job. my mom is one of those people on this subreddit that you guys dont like ( yelling at people for small thing, not understanding clearly stated rules to sales,coupons, etc.) its kind of embarrassing shopping with her. 

-

So I'm with my mom at this little outlet Verizon store trying to see if we can get some internet for our apartment. The guy helping us out was nice enough, helpful and explained everything pretty well. He set us up with a internet package with DSL internet and a TV package. 

So Verizon has to send us a modem through UPS, as it turns out Verizon gave UPS the wrong address (to our last residence, don't really know how they got that) so my mom gets PISSED so to calm her down I tell her I'll call UPS and fix it. 

So I'm talking to a UPS rep trying to get everything fixed and I do but mom asks me to hand over the phone so she can talk to them, me not thinking about it hands her the phone.

Mom: yes hello are with UPS?

UPS lady says something, I assume she says ""yes""

Mom: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!? I""VE BEEN WAITING ALMOST WEEK FOR THAT! YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE TO BILL ME BUT YOU CANT BRING ME MY BOX?!

I'm just there speechless as to why she is yelling at this poor woman.

Me: MOM! 

Mom: WHAT VoicesDontStop?

Me: they aren't the internet company, they're just the delivery company it's not their fault. Verizon gave them the wrong address.

Mom:......... hello? yes I'm sorry for that, here talk to my son.

I take the phone.

Me: Hello?

UPS Woman: Yes will that be all you were trying to fix?

Me: um, yeah.... sorry about that ma'ma.

UPS Woman: No I'm sorry.

Me: what? what do you mean?

UPS Woman: You have to live with her.

after that I hang up laugh to myself and go on with my day. A couple days later my bro told me about how she went down to the Verizon store and made a scene yelling at the Verizon guy who helped us get the internet package.

Frenchington,74,55,1r4g7b,303,"You know how you ""normal"" people out there seem to put your carts away in the designated areas? It makes sense doesn't it?
Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

RachelmElizabeth,37,75,1qs9et,290,"This is my second post on here and let me just say i've fallen in love with this subreddit because I now know i'm not alone with all the crazy customers.

This happened when I was working at clothing store that buys gently used teenage clothing (sounds like plates in spanish). I was about 30 minutes into my shift and this lady was running around with a friend and i'm assuming her daughter. They were really strange but I shrug that off because I had seen worse.

Well when it came time for them to checkout they had quite a few items. I'm ringing them up, making sure I don't leave any security tags on, then making a pile so I can put them in a bag. She starts getting really impatient with me even though i'm going as fast as a I can and says (we'll call her CL for crazy lady):

CL: ""You don't have to fold them, just shove them in a bag and hurry up.""

ME:""I'm sorry mam, i'm checking for security tags.""

CL:""Well you need to hurry up because I need to change my bandage. I got a foot of my intestines cut out and I shouldn't have been standing this long. Let me show you my bandage.""

Before I could tell her I was not interested in seeing it since I just ate lunch, This bitch pulls up her shirt and low and behold a huge clear bandage with her intestines protruding out of it. I don't get queasy easily but all I could think is if that bandage comes off all her insides are going to pour out like an episode of The Walking Dead and i'd have to be the one to clean it up.

GrimGuy,58,63,1qsw32,272,"The scene is a movie/game rental store in the final days before their downhill slide. This particular store is a fairly busy one, but it's a weekday afternoon and the place is nearly empty. I've been ""borrowed"" from another store for the day and, having just finished my shift, am lingering while I shoot the shit with coworkers.

Enter a child and his mother of non-assuming appearance and demeanor, their appearance and demeanor non-assuming enough that I forgot about them nearly immediately. Minutes pass, I putz around in indecision over which crappy movie to use my daily free rental on, and the mother/child come around to our games. 

Now, we primarily rented movies and games, but we did sell some as well. Invariably, the games we sold were ancient shovelware and sports games half a decade past their day; all of them were without instructions or original cases, all of them were scratched to hell. They were also all ludicrously overpriced, running damn near what a new game might.

For whatever reason, the child decides he has to have some baseball game. He's been quiet so far, but he's found his muse in the form of a brightly colored plastic box with one of our generic store inserts serving as cover art, and ""Baseball 2001"" written half-assedly on it in Sharpie. ""Baseball 2001"" could be one of a couple games, but the kid wasn't concerned with quibbling details. 
His mother, either due to wisdom or disinterest, wasn't having any of it. The first couple polite refusals weren't taken well, and soon the kid is pulling out the arsenal. He tried to bargain, he tried to plead, and the crying didn't come long after. 
Hoping to soothe him, she let him carry it while they continued their rounds. This only led to him using it to smack her on the leg and continue to ramp up his growing tantrum. Her refusals became more firm as time went on and things escalated steadily. 

By the time he threw himself to the floor in full tantrum, the scene had garnered the attention of my coworkers and I. It was nothing alarming, and there was an almost refreshing quality to the mother not breaking down in the face of a crying kid. When his tantrum began, she earned a bit more of our respect by taking the game from him and stating very clearly:
""I'm not buying you this game today. We can talk to your father tonight - but if you keep this up, I'm going to write down the game's name and tell him about it so neither of us EVER buys it for you for your WHOLE LIFE.""
My coworkers and I all had a look I can best describe as that Obama ""Not Bad"" face as we nodded to each other, assuming the matter was closed.

Not so.

The child, face red and tear-streaked, stopped making much noise. This wasn't because he was soothed or stopped, but because he'd turned into a white-hot ball of seething rage, his senses failing as his world collapsed around him.  
He started making noise, eventually, in an unconscious sort of way. It was this half-asthmatic, cat-in-heat, moaning sort of sound that belonged in a Lovecraft novel. It never got very loud, but his actions spoke volumes.

Promptly, he dropped his pants and took a splashing, chunky, yellow shit all over the floor. 


My curiosity about how this would end collided with my minimum-wage survival instinct, and I got the hell out of Dodge in short order. I'm told she cleaned it up, in tears, while the child went back to asking if he could have the game.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I’d much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being “backing”). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That’s why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it’s a land yacht. It’s being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it’s a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she’s going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don’t get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

“Hey, you!” She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don’t register that she’s talking to me.

“Hey, cart guy!” She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

“Do you ned help unloading?” I ask.

“No. I want to know why you dented my car.”

“I’m sorry?”

“You dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it”

“I was working on the other side of the lot. I haven’t been in this area for a while.”

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. “You left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?”

Ugh. “I’ll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.”

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

“You have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.”

“I wasn’t anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.”

“She says you did.”

“How? I’m not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.”

“Look. Be careful. I don’t want this happening again.”

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.”

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it’s bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

“You just totaled a $60,000 car!”

Now, I did not handle this well.

“YOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.”

Second rule of retail: “It’s your fault.” It should not be, but it is.

“I want to talk to a manager right now!”

Yuppie-Husband parks his “totaled” car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: “This kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?”

Side note: “Totaled” is short for “total loss” This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

“Lets discuss it in my office.” Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was “my turn.”

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don’t have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for “causing” and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband’s fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

genericname11,27,33,1r72se,241,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.



Lesson? If someone is supposed to come help you, don't freaking walk away so they can't find you.

GetKegged,83,56,1r4onp,234,"Hey everybody, so this is my first post to r/TalesFromRetail and I am only really posting this story because I saw a similar one on here Called ""The Bible Story"".

So anyway, I am new at my work, and I am a casual at a Jeweler. This was my first job so I put up with most stuff I didn't really like as I didn't want to cock it up. I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise. For about another month, Karen the Boss, would walk around quoting the bible, telling us in private how god is present when we work and how he is the one making us an income (I never saw him working once in the store) and how we wouldn't have jobs without him...Mostly the usual Bible-Thumper stuff. This was all until I finally blew up, in front of customers...She questioned me why I never wear a Cross or St Christopher medallion and how as it was ""part"" of the dress code, I could be fired for not wearing it. I turned to her and told her my ""view"" on everything she said, she started yelling, threatening to fire me I ended up resigning on the spot and I walked out. 

Skip ahead a month...Found out she had been ""Let Go"" due to workplace harassment that was tied in with her 'views' and she was reported for Harassing me and others by my colleagues.

Dr_Kelvin,50,46,1qxl83,218,"When I was in Highschool in Australia, I worked at a photo processing store across from a Supermarket. It was a reasonably up market processing chain, so the prices were a little higher than some of the other chains around the area, for example the processing cost for 36 photos was around $15 or $11 with a coupon from the Supermarket. 

One night a lady came in to pick up her photos, I quoted her the standard price of $15, she looked at me and said “I am not paying that”, cue an awkward silence before I reply “Well that is the price”. She again says “I am not paying that much, that is way too much for a roll of film”, to attempt to avoid any more arguments in front of the customers behind her I said “Ok Ma’am, no problems, I will be happy to ring you up for the coupon price of $11 then”. I started to ring it up for the discounted price and she stops me and says “No, I will not pay $11 either; I will only pay $9 for that roll of film because that is how much it should be.” I am generally pretty calm, but for some reason her attitude that night pushed me over the edge, so I held up her photos, pointed at the supermarket across from the store and said “Ma’am, I don’t know how you think this works but you cannot just come into a store and tell them how much you’re willing to pay for something. Do you walk into the supermarket pick up a steak and tell them how much you’re going to pay? No, you don’t, you pay the amount that is listed on the product. I don’t know why you think because we print photos the rules have changed, but they haven’t.” I threw her photos back into the drawer where we kept the prints that were ready to be picked up and continued “I am not sure why you think you can name your price, but I am more than happy to hold onto your cherished memories until you are ready to pay the full $15 as you do not have a coupon, if you’re aren’t ready to pay that they will be thrown out in 30 days as per store policy.” As I finished my rant her eyes were pretty wide and before she could reply my Manager ran up behind me and told me to go on break. 


I later found out he only charged her $9 for the photos and I also got written up with an official warning for poor customer service.

It was totally worth it.

IronyJudge,37,48,1qv462,212,"This afternoon I was manning the front of store, directing traffic and intercepting customers at the entrance if they needed help. If anything arose I'd be right on the spot to handle the issue.

A guy comes up with a dog bone, and the little sticker with the UPC had fallen off. The cashier made a little motion for me to go over, and I got the SKU for the bone. It was $7.99. He pays for it and wanders off.

As I'm dealing with a somewhat difficult customer at the register the bone guy storms up  **SLAMS** the bone down on the register full force and starts screaming in my ear.

Bone Head: ""**5.99!**""  
Me: ""I'm sorry it came up wrong, we can get it fixed for you. I just have to help this customer.""  
BH: **YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING THEIVES**  
Me: ""Again, we'll get this worked out.""  
BH: **DON'T TALK TO ME**  

The other cashier said she could help him over there, and I finish up the customer I was helping. Meanwhile I hear him screaming to the other cashier.

BH: **IT SAYS $5.99 ON THE TAG. RIGHT HERE** *slams shelf label on counter, breaking it*.  
Other Cashier: ""We can get this fixed for you easy.""  
BH: **YOU GUYS TRIED TO STEAL MY MONEY**

Me: ""I'm sorry, I can give you ""  
BH: **I TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY ANYTHING**

So I was working in a customer service call centre for a multinational grocery chain when I received a pretty typical complaint call from a pretty typical entitled asshat of a customer. It was something to do with product quality. I asked if he had the packaging. He didn't.  I asked for specifics regarding the poor quality, and the best he could come up with was that the sauce ""tasted funny"". Oooookay. Now, I should have let him go with nothing but I had only been in the role for a month and so I offered him 500 points on his reward card for the inconvenience.

""500 points?! That's what, £5? Not even worth it.""

Having had this more than reasonable offer thrown back in my face, I realised that I was done being nice.

""Ok then, sir. I'll still forward your complaint to the company. Thanks for bringing the issue to our attention.""

""When will I see the points on my account?""

In a saccharine tone of voice - ""Oh, no, you said that the points weren't worth it, so I've voided the credit. If you want to take the matter further, you can write to the address on the back of the receipt. Have a lovely afternoon!""

groundciv,26,49,1r4jqn,207,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

themonkeyone,33,40,1r7frc,212,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

SenorPierre,25,47,1r0aps,189,"what's up, Tales From Retail. I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

manager ""oh, okay then. have a good day, SenorPierre.""

chrilo,40,68,1qqbev,190,"Okay, some background first. The currency in Norway is crowns and cents (not really cents, but lets call it that for simplicity). When you buy a soda, or other kinds of soft drinks, you pay an extra 1 crown for the bottle if it's 0,5l, and an extra 2 crowns 50 cents if it's a larger bottle, this is known as pant. You get this money back when you return it, it's to make people recycle or something.

Now, a couple years ago, Norway removed cents (as in the physical coins, prices are still set to 1.49, 3.68, etc.) from it's currency system (1 US dollar equals about 6 crowns these days, so you can imagine how little it was worth), so if your total comes to 3 crowns and 0-49 cents, it's rounded down to 3 crowns, and up if it's 50-99 cents.

Finally, the real story. Now let me just tell you, I have seen some cheapskates in my day. I've had people yell me an earful because an item had the wrong price-tag, and people who would rip me a new one because a sale ended the day before. I've had customers that literally went to 5 different stores to get their shopping done, just so that they could take advantage of every sale they could find, but NOTHING beats this woman! 

This lady comes up to my register and hand me a check from the pant-machine. It's for 2 crowns and 50 cents, I scan it, press enter and lo behold, she gets her 3 crowns. Fairly uneventful. The she gives me another. And another. AND ANOTHER. Turns out she has 10 of these, that she wants in cash, one at a time, so that she can get an extra 50 cents for each. She should have gotten 25 crowns, she got 30. And after that she has the AUDACITY to ask me to change it for her, 'cause she ""doesn't want all this loose change"".

She basically did this to ""save"" 5 crowns, ALMOST 1 US dollar (I use the term lightly, swindle is really a more appropriate word). I was about ready to rip her throat out, unfortunately, my boss wouldn't let me...",So I had a run-in with the biggest cheapskate I have ever met today...,258

aub51zzz,20,37,1qxj70,185,"I've been reading these posts for a while now, so I decided I would share one of the *many* stories I have from working in the food service industry. 

I work at a chicken finger chain restaurant that has a drive-thru and a lobby, and this particular branch gets extremely busy during our peak times. This specific day, I was working in the drive-thru. My other coworkers and I are all on hyper-speed trying to get customers out of the drive-thru as fast as we can without sacrificing the quality of the food. We normal do an exceptional job at this. 

During one of our bursts, a car pulls up to the speaker, and I greet the customer over the headset with one of our overly-friendly, rhyming greetings. The woman on the other end clicks her tongue and says, ""I don't know what you just said. I just want my chicken."" 

I roll my eyes, even though she would not be able to see it. ""Sure thing, ma'am! What can I get for you?""

The lady proceeds with her order, and though she is rather snippy with her responses, it goes smoothly enough. She orders the most popular combo, which comes with a regular (21 oz) drink, specifies that she wants tea (which does not cost any extra,) and I tell her the total and she pulls up to the next window. 

We are slowing down at this point, and the coworker expoing the food runs to the restroom. I am left making the drinks and handing out the food, and luckily for me there are no more cars left ordering. 

The snippy woman pulls up to the window I was at and I smile as she rolls down her window. ""Hi, ma'am! You had a &lt;such-and-such&gt; combo with a tea to drink..."" I hand her the drink and she looks at me like I was the Devil. She has her fingers around the drink like it is full of poison, and asks,

""What the fuck is this?""

I am taken aback. ""Excuse me, ma'am?""

""The combo comes with a *large*, 32oz drink!""

I know this is incorrect, but my coworker has just come back and the drive-thru is picking up again. He is taking orders and the cars are building up. 

""Ma'am, the &lt;such-and-such&gt; combo comes with the regular, 21oz drink. Only the &lt;other&gt; combo comes with the large.""

She thrusts the drink back into my hand and clicks her tongue again. ""No. You're wrong. The other store in &lt;the neighboring town&gt; *always* gives me the large."" Which is wrong.

The cars are beginning to wrap around the store, and not wanting to upset a customer, I oblige with her obvious request. ""I am sorry about that confusion, ma'am. I will be more than happy to upgrade your drink for no extra charge."" I take her drink into the window and get her a larger tea, hoping that she will be appreciative and on her way. However, my patience is not enough for this woman. I hand her the drink with a smile on my face and hand her the food. ""Anything else I can get for you today, ma'am?""

""Your manager! I cannot believe the lack of service here!"" She goes on and on, and I quickly grab my manager. He tries to soothe her and offers her a free combo on her next visit, but she isn't taking it. She starts yelling, ""I am sick and tired of these high school drop-outs fucking up my orders!"" 

At this point, I am furious. At the time I was a high school senior, and I was soon to be graduated and off to one of the best, most prestigious public schools in the state. I nudge my manager out of the way and kindly say to the woman, ""Ma'am, can you please explain how I messed up your order to my manager?""

The woman is red with anger now and says, ""She gave me the wrong fucking drink!"" 
I point to the drink in her hand. ""What size is that drink, ma'am?""

""A large...?""

""Yes, ma'am. And what size did you want?""

""A large.""

""Correct. Now, I could have charged you extra for upgrading your drink, but I didn't. Because you paid for a regular. If you have an issue with my customer service, please explain it again to my manager.""

The lady stutters, fumbling for the words to explain the major crime committed against her.

""Anything else, ma'am?""

She shakes her head. 

""Alrighty then! Once again I apologize for the inconvenience. I guess they won't teach me manners until I get to college in a semester. Have an *awesome* day!""

The fact that she got so angry over a *drink* still amazes me to this day...

One day when I was a receptionist, a woman came in looking for directions. She had just moved to town and wanted to learn about the area. She was also trying to find a local historic school house her grandmother had attend in the early 1900's. We ended up chatting over this and where she was from for about a half an hour (it was a pretty slow job..) and she brought up that she was adopting a cat later that day. We talked more about that and had a really wonderful conversation. As she went to leave she stopped and turned back around.


""What is your name?"", She asked.


""The name's Herpsen!"" (It's pretty close)


""Herpsen. You are truly a remarkable young man,"" She said, ""right down to your name! Not a lot of people want to hold a long conversation with a loony old woman like me.""


Whoa. I was blown away by that.


""You seem like a very kind person which is so rare in people your age. And you have helped me more than you know today. I see you being an absolutely wonderful man!"" She continued.


""Well thank you very much."" I was really touched. ""This is such a professional place, it's a treat to get someone that's actually personable!""


She looked at me like she knew about a fountain of youth and was debating telling me. ""May I name my new cat after you?"", she blurted out.


SAYYYY WHAAAA??? ""Absolutely!"", I didn't even hesitate, ""If you think he can handle the pressure of such greatness!"" I said with a humble giggle.


She gave me the biggest, most heart warming, most genuine smile I have ever gotten. As she walked back to the door and said her good-byes, she said, ""Your legacy will live on!""


I stared out the door after her with complete shock. I thought about my ""legacy"".. Smoking lots of pot, trying very little in school, disappointing my parents, failing out of community college, getting arrested, stealing, and 9 years of therapy was what I immediately thought of.. But then I felt a warmth in my chest. She was right. I do have a big heart. I care!


So from then on that will be my legacy! 


It was just so beautiful!


That was about 9 months ago and I never saw the woman again. I have no idea if there is *actually* a cat out there named after me but that lady and her new cat will always be a part of who I am.

insecure_shit_knob,30,41,1r2plz,170,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.



",The one where the guy didn't understand clearance racks.,211
WishfulOne,29,27,1qv8pl,165,"I used to work with an older lady (she was 70+) whom I'll call Bee.  Bee had been working in retail a long time and was hired by our store when the company she had been working for closed down.  Bee was very set in her ways, insisted things should be done the way they were at her old store and could try the patience of the calmest saint but was also very kind and hard working.  

Bee really wanted the position of department head, the position she held in her previous store, and tried to get it several times.  She was continually turned down because she had never learned how to use the telxon (a device like a hand held computer that stores can use to order, do price changes, check what's on-hand etc.) and didn't think she should have to.  One day one of the managers caves and tells her she can have the position temporarily while one of the heads is on medical leave.  I'm given the task of teaching her to use the telxon.

Teaching her the telxon is an exercise in futility. She's just not getting it.  Part of me understands because this technology is all new to her and pat of me is screaming in frustration because I've explained it a dozen times already, wrote out step by step instructions and she still doesn't get it.

Cue the morning of this story.  I'm explaining something to another dept. head when Bee approaches us.

Bee: ""My telxon isn't working.  I don't know what's wrong with it."" She gives it a shake.

Me: ""Let me take a look at it."" She hands it over and I try to turn it on (yes, I honestly thought she didn't try to turn it on). It won't so I hand it back. ""I don't think it's frozen. You probably need a new battery.""

Bee: ""I didn't think it was frozen, it didn't feel cold."" And she walks off, hopefully, to get a new battery.

Kaeobais,30,49,1qu5pg,163,"I used to work at a fast food place in a mall. It was a pretty terrible job, over all, although the staff was mostly nice and I got whatever hours I wanted, almost. The issue is that the company is cheap (I got a 10 cent raise at one point, though!), the uniform sucked, and the people... well, I'll just tell you about them. I can't remember everything though, so expect some paraphrasing and lacking descriptions here and there.

It's also very late, so I'll just do a couple, and might post more tomorrow (if I can remember more good ones).

* **I find your lack of dip disturbing.**

The place had yam fries, which were served with a small plastic container of chipotle dip. One day, a guy who worked in the mall ordered said fries and dip. He was nice enough, and left to go eat his food at work. 

However, a little while later he returned. He placed the plastic container on the counter and said, ""What do you see?""  
""Uh, sorry?"" I replied.  
""What is this?""  
""Uh...?""  
""Where's the dip? Why the hell is there so little? Like, are you f@#$ing serious? There's barely enough for one fry. This is bulls%$t.""  
""Dude, the dip is free. If you want more you can have more.""  
""Well yeah I'd like some more!""  
So I grab him his dip, hand it to him, he scoffs, and says under his breath, ""F$%#ing ridiculous"" as he walks away.

* **Friday Guy**

Every Friday, around 10 to 5 minutes before close, a man in what I would guess is his early 40s would arrive, ordering the same thing every time: A cheeseburger and large fries, a large coke (which must be bagged), 4 packs of ketchup, 6 packets of salt, and 6 packets of vinegar. He always paid with a 20 and always required that his change be entirely in loonies ($1 for those outside of Canada). He would always exchange some of his spare change fore a quarter, and would always throw out his plastic bag in exchange for a new one. The most annoying part was he was very talkative. He followed every sentence with ""Okay?"" and expected you to reply, or else he would just keep asking. 

Upon leaving, he had to tell us that he would be back next Friday at the same time, and the Friday after that as well, as well as saying thank you and goodbye several times, and if you didn't respond he would continue saying it until you did. Apparently he would also come in the following Saturday to tell us he'd be there the following Friday, though I never witnessed it. He had been doing this for 5 years before I started, and never missed a day, except once, at which point he got angry and began banging on the counter because we were closed.

It's obvious he has severe OCD, so I can't really be mad at him or anything, but it was REALLY annoying, especially after a busy day.

* **Dumb Question Lightning Round!**  
    * ""Do you have any deals on?"" they ask, ignoring the banner 5 inches above him, the two posters on either wall, and the menu behind me all stating a 2 for 5 deal going on.  
    * ""Could I get a new burger? I asked for no cheese, but it has cheese on it."" they ask, handing me what's left of the burger they clearly had no problem eating.  
    * ""I'll have the double bacon burger. Is there any pork in that?""  
    * ""Can I get a McChicken burger?"" Pro tip: We weren't a McDonald's.  
    * ""I'll get a spicy chicken burger. Is that spicy?""  
    * ""I didn't bring my coupons, do you have any here that I could use?""  
    * Here in Canada we've phased out the penny. No stores will give you pennies in your change, and few will take them. We round either up or down to the nearest 5 or 0. So a woman bought some stuff, and I rounded down her change from $3.16 to $3.15. ""How come you get the extra change?"" she asks angrily.",Fast Food Fun,212
jorcoga,42,36,1r1ut3,162,"So we do breakfast products until 11am. Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

xVarekai,78,28,1r3e2x,158,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

I told her that couldn't cut in front like this, that she'd have to wait in line like everyone else. Oh, but nooooo, ""I only have a few things! It won't take long! I'm in a hurry!""

I just repeated the same thing, that she'd have to go to the back of the line. She was furious at this point and just dropped all of her stuff on my register as she stomped away.

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

meguriau,17,20,1r5sy8,154,"Hi TFR, I’m back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It’s been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn’t have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I’m sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That’s preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I’m afraid that’s the most I can do for you at this point in time. We’ll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN’T BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN’T GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN’T DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I’m terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you’d left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN’T CALL. 

**M:** I’m sorry to hear of your husband’s ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let’s just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don’t need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that’s retail!

Locclo,70,37,1qssv1,141,"**Background**: I work in the bakery department of a big retailer. My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor, and occasionally taking a cake order (or handing one over to a customer).

So, today I found out about something new that my store is doing, and I'm pretty bummed out about it. Where I work, the scheduling system gives a lot of freedom and control to the employees. Scheduling is automated, and it's based on what you put in for your availability, meaning that if you ask not to come in until 3 PM, the computer won't - and in most circumstances, can't - schedule you until 3 PM. What's more, managers can't change the schedule on a whim, they need your login and password in order to do it (and that's one piece of info they don't have).

What's all this got to do with anything? Well, for the first time since I've started, and probably as a result of Target infamously opening on Thanksgiving last year, the computer is allowed to schedule people completely outside of their availability for one week. Take a wild guess as to which one. 

Thankfully, the manager I spoke to said that he'd be able to tweak my schedule ever so slightly so that I can actually go to class on the Monday before Thanksgiving, since my school only closes on that Thursday, but sadly, for the first time in 22 years, I'm going to miss out on my family's big Thanksgiving dinner, because I have to work from 11 AM to 8 PM on that day, and dinner's right around 4-5. I even have to skip class on Black Friday, because my manager told me flat-out that I could not change my hours for that day. (Edit: to clarify, he did flat-out tell me that I wasn't going to be able to change my hours on Friday, but after reading some of these comments and considering my options, I'm definitely going to at least leave early on Friday to go to class)

I don't think I've ever contemplated calling in sick on a day that I know will be busy, but this news has me pretty tempted to do it on the 28th out of spite.

TL;DR: For one week out of the year, the world stops to stare at my store, and any employee who says otherwise might just be out of a job.

Edit: For the record, the store is open for 24 hours, and the only day they close is Christmas Day; the only change in policy here is that the computer is being allowed to schedule people outside of their availability, and said people are not allowed to change their hours on Thanksgiving/Black Friday.","A New Store Policy, or Why This is My Last Year",178
RaxonDR,23,36,1qqd6p,134,"A while ago, I posted the story of CRB. After a week, I have finally gotten the story out of her. This is that story. Names have been changed to amuse me. We will call CRB Daisy this time.

It was a typical day in the neighborhood, a typical day for cosmetics. Daisy was working her counter, when this kid, about thirteen or fourteen, ran past her, grinning. One of the security guys, Rosco, showed up, looking around. Daisy knew what was what and pointed where the kid had gone. A short while later, she's doing a bit of tidying, cleaning the front of her displays.

As she's bent over, she feels her skirt moving, followed immediately by an excruciating pain in her arse. ""That's what you get for snitching!"" The boy from earlier had just stabbed her in the ass by ramming three pencils into her soft flesh. He had pretty good aim. They were all right around her rectum. They were, unfortunately, cedar pencils. Daisy was and is allergic to cedar.

Her brain started to get muddled. She turned and slapped him so hard he fell down. Rosco showed up about the time she was starting to to get sick. She couldn't walk, but she had tears streaming down her cheeks.

She was gripping him by the collar of his shirt and hanging on for dear life. Her manager, Boss Hogg, was called, as well as her brother, Bo. They called an ambulance, and the EMT had to cut the boy's shirt to get him free.

Good thing they did, because she was having convulsions and shaking him violently. The kid was yelling ""GET THIS CRAZY BITCH OFF ME!"" Boss Hogg called the police, and decided to press charges. A few days later, Daisy was back to work. She needed a cane, and could not sit down, due to three sore, golf ball sizes swellings. She had to have a [very special pillow] ( http://www.hemroidharry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/donut-cushion-from-duro-med.DMI102.1.185.jpg) to sit on. Boss Hogg bought the pillow for her. She was and is one of his best workers.

A few days after she got back, guess who she saw! As the boy ran past, he said, ""bitch!"" She grabbed him by the back of his collar and yanked him off his feet. She let go and let him hit the floor hard. Homeboy was down and out.

Ambulance was called. Kid had a concussion. It was finally decided that he had ignored some wet floor signs. That was the last they ever saw of homeboy. Daisy got a verbal warning and told she was lucky no customers had been around.

Ever since, she has been referred to as the ""Crazy 'Roid Bitch""",Origin of the crazy 'roid bitch.,170
spotty82,18,26,1r43bb,139,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

TennisAndBeer,4,27,1r63y6,143,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues. 

When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous, technically she's in another department, but she's been there like 20 years so I'm sure she could have me fired. However, she was actually very mature about the whole thing. She apologized again and thanked me for the warning, saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadn't realized it.

blarglznoflo,28,43,1qqwj5,135,"A few weeks ago or so, my store had a brand of vitamins/supplements on sale as buy one/get one free. Simple, right?

The brand has tons of coupons. There are almost always those little folded-up coupons stuck to the top of the bottles. I mean, it's a decently expensive brand of vitamins, so people really appreciate getting a buck or two off of their $16 vitamins (although we sell the same thing in much cheaper brands, but whatever...).

Well, I had a customer come through and, in addition to his groceries, he had two bottles of these vitamins. First, I had to explain to him that they had to be the same price for the BOGO, but he accepted that easily enough and we had a clerk grab a replacement bottle so the BOGO would work.

I put it through just fine, he paid like $11 for one and the second was free.

He then hands me all his grocery coupons, and eventually I notice several coupons for these vitamins. I point out to him that we're only allowed to use one vendor coupon on each item, so I would only be able to use one of his ""$1.50 off a bottle of Vitamin Brand"" coupons.

He freaked the heck out. 

Customer: ""No! I paid $11 for TWO BOTTLES, so I need to get all $3 off!"" (the amount it would be with the two coupons, in case that wasn't obvious)

Me: ""But sir, because of the sale, technically you only paid for one bottle. We sold you the second bottle at zero dollars, and we can't take $1.50 out of zero. The computer simply will not let me.""

I turned my screen around so he could see the error message that popped up when I scanned the second coupon. It was something like ""no applicable item"" because, well, one coupon had been applied to bottle 1, and bottle 2 wasn't eligible.

Of course, he gave my favorite outcry of ""let me talk to a manager about this!""

I called over a manager, knowing that I had done it correctly. We face this issue EVERY...TIME we have this sale. But he kept repeating what is now my least favorite phrase, and I do not understand how every problem customer is convinced of this delusion...

Customer: ""I did this just last week!""

Manager: ""Sir, we don't allow that on BOGO sales. And these weren't on that sale last week.""

Customer: ""Well, it was last time, whatever. And (name of another manager) let me do it.""

Manager: ""No, sir, she wouldn't have because this is part of our company policy, we've discussed this issue about this sale.""

Customer: ""Well, I did it last week!""

Manager: ""And you won't be able to do it today. Do you want the two bottles for $9.50, or not?""

Customer: ""Not if you won't let me use coupons like EVERY OTHER STORE!""

Manager: ""Ok then, sir!""

She removed the coupon and took the vitamins back to put them away.

These vitamins are usually $15+ at regular price. We have them on sale, PLUS buy one/get one free, PLUS using a coupon...so getting about $30 of vitamins for $9.50 wasn't good enough for him?","No, you can't get $1.50 off a free product.",178
Lightfairy,25,42,1qz14s,131,"I work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city. I have posted other stories (Go search! Still haven't worked out how to link stuff!). I get to deal with all sorts of weird and wonderful people and with fetishes that I had no idea existed (google is my friend) but the ones that I do bend over backwards for (get your minds out of the gutter people!!) are the people who come in seeking advice/help due to medical conditions. Life really hands you lemons when you lose your sex life due to accidents or other causes. I worked for a while as a carer for disabled/elderly/sick/dying people. In that job I provided personal care such as assisting with showering/bathing/dressing and all aspects of assistance needed for a person to maintain their lifestyle and their dignity. I try to carry some of that over to my job. I really have seen it all!

Todays tale. A gentleman of around 45 comes into the shop. He makes some inquiries about our range of strap-ons. I go through the different models and show him the various features. He also asks a few questions about other 'toys' that will help him give his wife pleasure. He starts getting chatty and tells me he has had some surgeries and as a result of his medical issues has been left heavily scarred and is impotent. He still wants a happy wife, hence the reason for his visit. He continues detailing his various surgeries for me and then out of the blue says,

'And this is the result' and promptly drops his trousers!

There is this man standing in front of me with his pants at his knees (he had no underwear on), pointing to his limp member. 

'It's dead! Bloody useless thing! Never to rise no more!' 

He points to the scars. 

'And look at this! Bloody road map over my stomach and abdomen! Ugly as fuck!' 

He gesticulates wildly at his nether regions.

I peer down and say, 'I can see what you mean but it really doesn't look all that bad based on the surgeries you just detailed to me. I have seen far worse.'

He pulls his pants up 'Really?' 

'Yes sir' say I 'it sounds like you are lucky to be still alive.'

'Yes I suppose I am' he says  'and my wife still loves me and I love her.'

'I think you are a pretty lucky guy then.' 

He smiled.

Went on to spend about $300. To me it wasn't really the money. It shows that adult shops serve another purpose. We are not just there for shits and giggles. We actually help make people happy, keep relationships together and keep that sexual energy flowing. 

TL;DR Richard Gere came into the shop. Didn't have a gerbil! No really, read the story!

albinosquirel,24,22,1r6unw,129,"Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.

RenM,60,20,1qwc0g,118,"So I used to work as a pharmacy technician which means I both handled prescriptions and rang up everyday shopping items for customers. It was a combo hell. Here are some of the stories:

1. We had a regular that was HIV positive, super nice, but also a bit mentally disabled. His mother often brought him to the store or just picked up his meds for him. However, one day he came in without her and we exchanged our normal pleasantries. He said he needed a refill, I said I needed a new prescription, he pulls it out of his wallet and I see that his finger is bleeding (it looked like a paper cut). He take out his prescription with said bleeding finger, and attempts to hand it to me. Normally policy is to hold a customer until you are done running the script incase insurance feels like making the job extra awful. Instead I say while typing, ""Oh no, [name]. It looks like you cut yourself. Just put the script on the counter and here take a bandage (which I don't hand to him but instead place on the counter, normally rude but...). We'll call you when the script is ready."" He just smiles, says thanks, puts on the bandaid, and walks away. I smile until he disappears behind an aisle and then tell the pharmacist what just happened. In the end we cleaned it up and my manager actually called his mom. His mom apologized. She was sick and he wanted to run errands on his own. I guess she explained to him that he can't bleed on public things b/c he apologized profusely the next time he came in with her. 

2. Our duties board is posted in a place that customers can see it. This means if they feel like being creepy they can tell when you start work, get off work, or take a lunch break. I had one older gentleman look at my name tag, then at the board, and then he said, ""I'll be waiting for you at 9pm."" Then he winked and walked away. The assistant manager walked me to my car that night.

3. Another older gentleman came to pick up his viagra. That stuff is expensive so most men only get a few pills at a time and refill as necessary. This man said, ""My wife and I don't do it that often anymore. Maybe one of these pills has your name on it?"" Me: ""No, I'm pretty sure they just say 'Pfizer' on one side and 'VGR 100' on the other. Sorry."" Then I walked away. 

4. I lady comes up to buy a behind-the-counter cold medicine. 
Me: ""Can I see your drivers license please?"" 
Lady: ""No."" 
Me: Kind of caught off guard. ""Um...I need it to sell you the medicine."" 
Lady: ""Why?"" 
Me: ""State law."" 
Lady: ""Why"" (She was well into her 40's so I'm not sure why she was mimicking a toddler).
Me: ""Because some of the ingredients can be used to make illegal drugs.""
Lady: ""Like what?""
Me: ""Meth.""
Lady: ""I don't make meth. Can I have it now please?""
Me: ""No, I still need a drivers license.""
Then she asked for the manager. I got the pharmacist and she had nearly the exact same conversation with her. The lady ended up just leaving. To this day I still think she was screwing with us.

5. My favorite story. There was a doctor in the area that had a couple of his prescription pads nicked. All the pharmacies were on alert and he had already agreed to call in any prescriptions until he could get new pads made. Well a couple comes in (and not to judge but they were the rattiest, dirtiest, couple I had ever seen. I mean they actually had dirt on them and smelled like they hadn't bathed in weeks.) and gives me a prescription for a Class 1 Controlled Substance I had never seen filled in my 3 years of working there. We always had a bottle stocked but I never saw us actually fill a prescription for it. This was my first red flag. Then I get to the doctors name and it's just a scribble (not really uncommon), so I go to the typewritten section and realize it's for the doctor that had his prescription pads stolen. I tell them I'm sorry but I can't fill the prescription. I don't give them a reason why. (I hadn't thought this through yet.) So they say okay and instead of leaving pull out a second prescription but for a simple Class 3 Controlled Drug. This time I just take the prescription, smile and say I'll call you when it's ready. Instead I called the cops. 

6. Finally, my last story which shows that sometimes it's not the customer that is the jerk. It's a pharmacy. We sell Plan B. If you are over 18 you do not need a prescription. So I'm working prescription drop off, the pharmacist is mixing up a compound, and my least favorite coworker is working prescription pick up. It's late so it is just the three of us, and I had no customers so I'm just filling the next days orders when a lady walks up to the pick up area. She is a good 30 feet away and very quiet so I can't really hear what she says. Apparently my coworker couldn't hear her either b/c she goes ""What?"" The customer speaks up and all I hear is Plan B. I know my coworker hates all birth control, but what she does next is mortifying. 
Lady: mumble mumble ""Plan B"" mumble mumble
Coworker: ""Oh."" She looks at me, and opens her mouth. 
Me (thinking): ""Don't you dare do it. Don't you dare.""
Coworker (yelling): ""This lady wants some Plan B. Will you take care of it? I won't fill a baby killing drug.""
There is a loud clanging as the pharmacist drops her pestle, the customer begins to cry, and I am just standing there jaw open. 

The pharmacist could not control herself. She yells my coworkers name and brings her into the back room. I take care of the crying customer and get her a gift card that more than pays for the Plan B. I apologize profusely, and she leaves no longer crying but obviously upset. 

My coworker comes out upset and angry, but she returns to her job. About 40 minutes later I'm off for the night so I clock out. I walk from behind the counter to pick up look at my coworker and go ""I need to pick up a prescription. *pause* It's my birth control."" It's not Plan B, but she hates it too. She turns red, looks at the pharmacist who goes ""nope"", and then gets me my prescription. That was her last week. ",Pharmacy Stories,138

- ""Do you have a tailor on staff?""

- ""If I try to shrink this and it shrinks too much, can I return it?""

- ""If I wait to return these shorts until next summer, will I get a full price refund for them?""

- ""So...how do I tell what the sizes are?"" (cue me pointing out the size rage, the size label stamped into the clothing, and the size sticker)

 - ""Can I use a coupon on my credit card bill?""

-  ""How do I know what's on sale?""
""Anything on promotion will have a sign with it.""
""So, this sweater?""
""No, unfortunately not this one, but these tops over here are on promotion, just look for the white and red sign.""
""Oh... How about this jacket?""
""No. Just. The. Signed. Items.""

- ""Can yo just give me $15, I didn't find anything I want to use my $15 coupon on and it expires tomorrow, so can you just give me the $15?""

Stuck_In_Purgatory,7,24,1quu03,111,"I work in a fish and chip shop in Australia. It's a great job and I love it. Last night, I had a couple interesting encounters and thought I'd share them with you!

There's a group of young boys ranging from about 10 to 13 that hang around the shop sometimes. Yesterday, 2 of them came in and sat on the chairs and waited. My boss (who is Greek and doesn't have the best English) asked what they were waiting for. The older one says ""oh we ordered $5 chips and 2 potato cakes.""
I laughed and told them ""we don't have any orders for that.""
Their response? ""well that didn't work.""  So they got up and left. I was both annoyed and amused. Amused that they thought we were that stupid, and annoyed that they were so rude to try scam food off us. 

A little while later there was a few more of them. 5 total. The youngest one walks into the shop, looks at our lollies, and walks out. Bit of info: we have a container of lollies in front of the register for paying customers to eat. Now these kids had no intention of buying anything, so when the kid walked out my boss's son said quick grab the lollies! So I took them to the back right as they walked back in. 
Kids: ""aww where's the lollies?""
Me: ""I took them to fill them up.""
The kids seemed happy about that, thinking they'd have even more lollies to take, until I said:
""except you don't get any, because you haven't bought anything."" and I walked off. All the other workers kinda laughed that I'd be so mean but they definitely deserved it. 
Boss's son talked to them for a tiny bit but they realized they couldn't scam free shit off us, so they left. 

I can't believe that kids these days are so rude and disrespectful. Which is why I don't take their shit.

A little later, a guy and his girlfriend ordered food. Once it was ready they decided to buy drinks and a sauce. The total came to $5.10

Remember how I said I'm in Australia? Our smallest coin is 5c. And no one tips except to say oh keep the 10c (or whatever) change. 

The guy pulls out two $5 dollar notes. I hand him one back and tell him not to worry about the ten cents. He hands it back to me and says, ""keep the change.""
I asked him if he was sure he wanted to give me $4.90 change to keep and he said yes. So I thanked him and told him to have a good night.
I went abd told my boss and she said ""that's the biggest tip we've ever had!"" I told her, ""well it makes up for all those 10c we tell people not to worry about.""

littlewoolie,8,24,1r6hc9,112,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,136
Foliagus,25,25,1r761t,113,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.

consultingcanadian,10,17,1qyln0,102,"Hello TFR! Haven't posted in a while, but I had a very interesting Saturday so I thought I would share. Sort of a short one but very odd.

So I work in a typical Canadian grocery store, and where I work we have a choice of what to wear for our uniform. We always have to wear black pants, black running shoes, and our choice of a work shirt, sweater, hoodie, or rain jacket. If we wear a hoodie or rain jacket we have to wear a colour underneath that matches to the store colours. So on Saturday, instead of wearing a work shirt I decided to wear a sweater and a barely revealing tank top underneath (this is relevant, don't you worry your pretty little retail head).

Now on to the actual story.

So it's a Saturday, pretty typical business, nothing too major. I then get a (what appears to be very Russian) middle-aged woman and what I assume is her daughter. They say hello and start loading their stuff up, I scan as fast as I can go as it's getting fairly busy. Her total comes to around a little over $300. I tell her the total and she hands me what she assumes is $300. I count it over three times and I only end up having about $220. I tell her this and she immediately gets mad.

&gt; Her: No, I gave you $300.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Mam I've counted it three times and I only have $220. I have nothing else here.
&gt; 
&gt; Her: Well I gave you $300, where is it!?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Mam I only have $220 I can assure you I do not have anything else.

I count it out in front of her and it shows that I only have the $220.

(Now, I should point out, I'm short. Like, really short. This woman had a good few inches on me.)

She starts to look around, very frustrated with me, and then she proceeds to get on her tippy toes, look over my register and glance down my tank top. I basically stood back after seeing what she was doing and gave her a WTF face. She backs off and, while still acting very rude, Throws the rest of the money at me while still telling me that she gave me $300. At this point she's held up my line so I'm a bit pissed. I give her the change and she goes on her way, still complaining. 

Surprised she didn't want a manager. I would never take money, my mom is one of my managers so I would not only get fired but get disowned from my family. I've never been accused of taking money before either, so this was a new one for me.

chesterfeildsofa,29,19,1qvy3h,103,"I worked 3rd shift at a grocery store for around 6 months, and I would start at 10pm, get my lunch at 2am, and get off at 6am. For my 2am lunch, the assistant manager(AM) would have to come up and run the register the 30 minutes i was gone, as well as close out the register for that day. It was probably worded different, but at 2am the computers would freeze and not let you scan anything until you did the end of day stuff. 

I can only remember one extreme coupon incident. I think maybe twice a year the store would have triple coupon days, where any coupon under $.99 would automatically be tripled. 

This lady came in around 1am and got to my register around 1:45am. She had a TON of coupons and a lot of duplicate items. I finished scanning all of her items and had started scanning the coupons around 2:15am. So of course the computer would freeze right then. The AM tried to fix it, but it said nothing could continue without doing the end of day, which would also void the entire transaction. A line had started to form behind the lady, so the AM said he would rescan all of her items on a different register while I took the other people behind her.....only my computer wouldn't work until he did the end of day stuff. So I am standing there, looking like an idiot, while he tries to get this lady out of the store. Then HIS computer freezes. I don't know what happened after that because he told me to go to lunch, and he would take all the other customers on his register. This whole situation was confusing as fuck because he was so frustrated and wouldn't explain anything he was doing to me.

I came back 30min later and he tells me he got her taken care of, and she got $300 dollars worth of stuff free, and he even had to give her money from the register when he was done. I thought that was probably a huge mistake, but whatever, it's on him not me.

The next night I come in and the General Manager asked me what had happened, so I told him the story of the previous night. Turns out the triple coupon deal was only to be applied to the first 3 coupons for a certain item, then just the regular coupon after that. No one had told us this before they left the previous day, so we didn't get in trouble for it.

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

It's about noon when we're looking out the windows of the local burger joint I work at. Our food is made to order, so we always park cars at the drive thru. This was not happening today. The winds were howling. The clouds were rolling over and swirling around, and the sky rapidly darkened. Every now and then, lightning would streak across the clouds. In the morning, we got a few sudden hits of torrential downpour. The FSM literally dumped the entire water content of His pot on us when He went to strain His pasta. There is a huge sloping ditch next to our parking lit, and it became a miniature lake by around noon time.

We got a call from one of the owners, and we all stopped doing what we were doing. NOPE. She wants us to stay open. Areyoufuckingkiddingme.

So we had to take orders at the window since it was impossible to hear anything but wind at the speaker, and since we were not parking, only one order at a time was going out. People were getting impatient and we had a few drive off from the drive thru line. By half past noon, nobody was outside, and the few customers we had in the dining room didn't want to leave. Which was totally fine and understandable. Especially when the tornado sirens started going off.

The clouds a few miles out that we were watching from the window looked like they were trying to form. We start trying to gather up the two families left to shepherd them into the bathroom, when I hear my headset beep. I look over at the other cook who was manning drive with me. She goes to answer it, and the guy starts trying to yell over the sirens his order.

Dude. Get the fuck out of your car and come inside.

He eventually gives up trying at the speaker box while my coworker was trying to get him to just get inside. He pulls up at the window and actually honks at us.

PWND_U_IN_MK,47,25,1qw874,89,"Wall of text incoming...3...2...1...GO!

So I work at a retail pharmacy/convenience store. I don't work within the pharmacy, but I work at the front end of the store, where I am one of the managers. Although it's not entirely significant to this story, I'll let you know that the front end is open 8am-10pm 7 days a week, while the pharmacy is open 9am-9pm weekdays, and 9am-6pm weekends. On with the show.

So the night before last I had two very drugged out 20 somethings come into my store. They were both wearing jogging pants and jogging jackets with zippers. His was grey, dirty, and far too baggy for him causing the pants to droop. Hers was black and probably the right size, but her jacket was zipped open to reveal a t-shirt that was many sized too small leaving 4 inches of flabby midriff exposed. Both of them were as pale as ghosts and have the telltale facial marks of meth addiction.

They come straight up to the counter and ask if the pharmacy is open. I assure them, that as it is 8 pm on a sunday it is not open at this time. The male asks if there is another pharmacy nearby that would be open. I tell him that I don't know off hand but that I can check our system to see. I go into the office, and see that there is a 24 hour store just a few miles away form us.

I return to the male who is at the front counter and ask him if he is walking or driving. He looks at me, puzzled for a second, as if to say, ""Where am I  going?"" His drugged out train of though reminds him that he asked about the pharmacy, and he replies ""driving."" I tell him that there is a 24 hour store less than 3 miles from here. I offer him the address, and he loses concentration for a moment. He then asks me if I know any of our nearby competitor/s pharmacy hours.  I do not.

His initial reason for needing a 24 hour pharmacy was that we are the only ones that take his insurance. Now he is rambling that he will check the competitors to see if they take his insurance. At this point he runs off into an aisle to meet his woman. 

I tell my cashier to find them, and watch them like hawks, while I man the register. He nods in agreement and makes his way over to them.

The man and woman have a very loud expletive filled conversation with one another about what they should get. The man comes to the front to get cigarettes. I'm worried that the drug use has artificially aged him, so I ask for his ID. He doesn't have it. He yells down the aisle for the woman to bring her ID to the front. She yells that she doesn't have hers with her. He asks me if a passport will be okay, and I oblige him.

He tells me, and this is important, that his passport is in the truck. So I set the cigarettes to the side and help other customer while he runs out to get it. 

He comes back, the passport shows him born in 1991, which makes him old enough. I ring up the cigarettes again and tell him the total. He tells me that the woman has the money, and runs off to bring her to the front. She loudly exclaims that she obviously wants to buy everything once, and that the cigarette purchase will have to wait.

I call my cashier back to the front, as I have to leave the front to help a real customer.

Fast forward a bit, and they are at the front with Milk, ice cream, and cookies, much less than the woman seemed to be carrying around. They ask if we can check the balance of their food stamps card, my cashier tells them we cannot, and so they stand at the front counter and call the phone number on the back of the card to check their balance.

I manage to ring out most of the line of customers forming behind them. The whole time the guy is loudly complaining about how they cut stamps benefits for everyone, using lots of colorful language. He keeps telling my cashier that they were only supposed to cut it $20-$30 but him and a buddy of his went down $120. Oddly enough none of our other multitude of food-stamp customers have mentioned this.

Finally they find out that there is around $5 dollars on the card, they swipe it to pay, but obviously it's not enough to cover the food in the transaction, so it is declined. I tell them any my cashier that if they don't have enough to cover the full amount on the card, that he must enter the exact amount they wish to use, and then the rest can be paid separately. At this point they decide not to buy the food, and to instead just buy the cigarettes with cash.

All is well, except that the woman's fairly large canvas bag purse seems much fuller than when she walked in. The walk through the doors and the shoplifting alarm goes off, myself and my stocker immediately head over to stop them.

The man immediately exclaims that the alarm went off because of him. It didn't, it obviously went off when the woman's purse went through. I tell the woman I need to see in her purse, as it is what set off the alarm. She holds it up and sticks her face in it. She exclaims nothing is in it except for her stuff.

I grab the purse to look inside of it, and she grabs it back and screams at me. She exclaims that it is her personal purse and you go lookin' in peoples personal bags.

Her and the boy friend bolt out the door. Myself and my stocker follow them out. I tell them that I am calling the police and begin placing the call on my phone. At this point I could grab her bag from her, but I don't I have health insurance and I'm not getting into a fight with two druggies.

This is the fun part, the girl is screaming to the guy to get into the truck. It's a black ford explorer, that my stocker is writing down the license plate of.

The man starts saying ""We didn't bring the truck. This isn't my truck. We don't have a truck.""

The woman after a minute or so decides she has had enough, and begins walking away in tears. 

The man shrugs and gets in the truck finally and pulls out of the parking lot.

The woman runs around the other side of the car and jumps in, and they speed off into the night.

The police arrived a few minutes later and we file a report, complete with the tag number of the truck.

vegasyndrome,23,38,1qulv3,89,"I work at a baby store. Recently we had a sales associate ring through a hefty order last week. She made a couple of mistakes while ringing through this customer (the expecting grandparents). She accidentally discounted too many items on this invoice. One of my managers noticed this and pointed out that we didn't break even (around 5%). 

The expecting mother calls us a couple of days later and pointed out we didn't discount a couple of items on her receipt. We explained why we didn't (long winded but valid) and I was told she said ""I guess you don't want our business then."" 

I don't get that. Most of our products don't have a margin greater than 40% especially the bigger ticketed items. We gave this customer's parents around 45% off their whole order. We lost money. Why do we exist as a business if we are expected to give them more? Why bother running a business at all if we don't make money? 

Does anyone have an answer for me?",Rant: What's the point of existing if we don't make money?,127
KGBsurveillancevan,6,21,1qs00e,92,"Earlier this year, I worked for a franchise that bought and sold used clothes. I only worked there for three months total, but one of the regulars that I started recognizing was a tall, gorgeous redhead in her late 20s or early 30s. She was always really nice to the staff, and just casually flirted with the guys on staff, including myself. One of the most charming people I've met, and by far my favorite customer. Everything about her was just relaxed, energetic and carefree, even though none of my coworkers knew anything about her.

The last time I saw her was during my last week of work, two weeks before I moved to another state. She was in the store with what I presumed to be her boyfriend. She chatted with my manager briefly, just asking him to open a fitting room for her. He did, and then walked over to me. ""Dude. She just said the craziest thing to me. I'll tell you on break.""

She finishes trying everything on, we check her out, and she leaves. When I go on break, my manager comes back to the break room, and I ask him what it was she said that got him so freaked out. He had just commented on that she was trying a lot of things on (as she usually does), and she just smiled at him and said sweetly, ""Yeah. But if you've only got six months left, why not get everything you want?""

He didn't say anything, just politely opened the door and let her in. She didn't offer any explanation to what she said, and I haven't seen her since. We still don't know what to make of it, but our first thought was ""dude... is she fucking dying?""

BadgerSixTwo,9,18,1qrroa,89,"I work in tourism and my job is primarily to sell tickets for various length excursions. I also have certification to operate the equipment so I work out on the trips as well. About a year and a some months back, the trip was shortened due to flood damage and I was working the trip.

At the end of the trip, we all stand by the exit and wish people a good day. There are four workers on this trip consisting of me doing ground work, N doing narration, W the old conductor, and E the engineer.

The trip unloads front to back and the last two groups are a mother-daughter (MD) pair about 80 and 50 years old, respectively, and a family of four. As the MD pair are leaving, they see my orange vest and stop to complain about the family causing too much noise and how it ruined their trip and they wanted a refund. I apologized and said they could talk to the manager (J) inside where they picked up their tickets. They complain for another minute or so and start to move on (slowly though, the mom has a walker).

The family is behind them and aren't even listening to them. They seem normal and during the whole trip they were no louder than every other child on any of our excursions. Also, at no point during the trip did the pair complain. I also say they both complained when it was actually just the daughter.

They get about ten feet and stop at N and complain to him as well. He heard me and gave them the same instructions to see J. Meanwhile the children are getting bored because two old women aren't moving, so they busy themselves with patty cake. The daughter (D) hears this and loses it.

D: SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP! THE WHOLE TRIP YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT LOUD AND RUDE AND IF YOU WERE MY CHILD I WOULD PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE!

The parents move in to protect their children. N draws the pair's attention to him and I take the family out the second exit at the back, profusely apologizing for their behavior and assuring them their kids were fine the whole trip and the pair were being unreasonable in their expectations of children.

After this I stand at the main exit and wait for them to leave. They finish with N, mad that someone let the family off before them. Next in line is E.

E is an older man who has that sort of pissed off look at all times. He can be a pretty nice guy though. That being said, he doesn't take anything from anyone and will be up front  about it.

D: We just wanted to comp-

E: I don't want to hear it.

D: But-

E: Leave.

They climb down the steps and turn to me, the only person with an orange vest. She starts complaining again instead of focusing on her elderly mother trying to climb down the steps. I tell her I heard her complain already and I would take her straight to J. She still complains to me anyway and her mom almost falls because of her inattention.

As we walk in she spots W the conductor and goes to complain to him. W is a sweet, friendly guy, but he doesn't know how to handle complaints that well. I tell her he's not J and I will take them to J.

We get inside and they spot N moving snacks from the trip back inside for the day and try to stop him to complain. He din't stop and just said ""I'm busy right now."" D shouted that he was rude but he kept going.

They finally get to J. They complain to him and I tell him my side out of the pair's earshot. He denies them a refund because 1. no refunds anyway and 2. they didn't have a valid reason. D flipped out again how we were all unprofessional and we cheated her out of her money and we were going to go under if we didn't change our ways and how dare we refuse them a refund, didn't we know who they were, etc.

Captain-TomTom,48,27,1qrots,92,"Have you seen those shirts with the above mentioned title name? ""I love my church."" ?

I see them all the time where I work. Ah, the joys of working in retail. No I'm joking. Anyone with a few amount of brain cells would know there is little to no joy in retail.

Now about this shirt. I work in an art store. We cater to the creative crowds. Usually our customers range from teachers, to soccer moms, to christian educators of the like. They flock to our stores each Friday, Saturday and especially Sunday when the new sale starts up.

These customers are 80% more likely to wear this shirt ""I love my church."" You'd think they'd be our most understanding and nicest customers. The model christian that everyone aspires to be (Or believe they are.) Yeah I thought that too for a while.

You see these people are something different. Outwardly they wear a smile that seems as if they are a friendly and kindhearted individual. However, if you were to look deep into their eyes. I swear to you, they are not human. They are something else. Something evil...

This one customer changed my entire view on this shirt. But its just a shirt Captain TomTom, it can't be that bad. Oh, but it is. Oh, but it is...

I had the pleasure of cashiering a sunday afternoon right after the churches let their sheep out of their sermons. (I call them wolves in sheeps clothing. Thats what they are.) Most of them wear this shirt I keep bring up. So did this customer who I'm finally starting to tell you about.

I knew she was trouble when she walked in. (Our store likes to play this song over and over on the PA system. Even during chistmas time.) In tow she had 3 kids who immediately left her side and went running through the store. I greeted her from the registers and she smiled and was mumbling about something to herself and continued on her way. Not before I glimpsed at her shirt: ""I love my church."" I was naive to the plight of retailers at the time. I did not know what was in store for me.

Roughly about 13 minutes later she comes to the front of the store with a shopping cart full of random items. Yarn, popsicle sticks, glue, construction paper... all kinds of stuff. She still had that smile on her face. The kids were following her and had candy and other crap that crafty kids like within their grubby little hands. I cleared my throat and began. ""Thank you for shopping at -----'s I can check you out here.""

She motions her 3 kids to come along. The 3 kids immediately started to pile up things on the register making it hard to keep things organized. The mother of the three dug into her purse and pulled out several coupons. That was the second omen. Our store has a strict coupon policy. One coupon per customers, per day. We can't bend the rules at all for anyone no matter who they are, what they do, who they are affiliated with. In bold print it clearly states our coupon policy on each and every coupon. It also states it on the registers. On the walls when you first enter the building. In the bathrooms. But these signs seem to get ignored.

She hands the coupons over to me. They were all the same ones. 40% off one regular priced item. ""I'm sorry ma'am. You can only use one coup---""

Before I finished she smiled and said. ""Ok."" I smiled back thinking she understood. She kept mumbling and talking. Then I realized she had a bluetooth earpiece in her ear. Apparently holding a conversation with someone on the other end. That was the third omen. I was clearly a deer in headlights. I proceeded with the transaction, scanning and bagging each item. When I was picking though some of the things piled up on the registers. I touched something wet... and slimy. One of those nasty little kids opened a sucker and licked it and put it in the pile of items on the counter. Immediately I recoiled and investigated what it was I touched.

I gagged a bit as the drool trailed from my fingers to the sucker. I quickly regained my composure and wiped my hands on my apron. (someone stole the napkins from my register along with the hand sanitizer that day.) I looked at her seeing if she was going to apologize as she was staring at me. No, she was carrying on her conversation in that earpiece. The kids looked at me and just laughed. Those little laughs haunt me till this day. It was just innocent child laughter. It was off, it was like they plotted to do that. I could be paranoid but those laughs tell me other wise.

After bagging several items,  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She was going to pay and leave with her little monsters. She dug in her purse again and pulled out the coupons. I stared at her baffled for a moment seeing that she understood that she couldn't use those coupons. ""You forgot my coupons."" She smiled again.

""I'm sorry Ma'am but our coupon policy only limits one coupon per cust----."" She cut me off again.

""Yeah I know. Can we just split the transactions or something and I can pay it several times?"" She started to wag the coupons impatiently. 

""No ma'am I can't do that all. It wouldn't be fair to the oth---."" To my absolute horror her eyes narrowed as if I shot her in the heart. Her face went from a fake smile to a completely menacing bitch from the 6th level of hell. 

""I don't see why you even have coupons all the time if you can't use them at all. What kidn of place is this?! I thought this place was for creative people. All you people want to do is take money. How about giving for a change."" She continued on and on. I almost blacked out for a moment. Literally spit was flying out of her mouth and hit my glasses. 

""I--- Well our coupon pol---."" Again she cuts me off on queue. 

""I don't care about the coupon policy. You know what?! I don't want any of this! Come on lets go."" She motioned for her brats to follow suit. I thought it was over as she started to make her way to the exit. No. No it wasn't over. Right when I started to move the cart of bagged items out of the walkway for the next customer. She comes back again. ""This place is the devil! You are just a follower! Coming to work and trying to swindle hard working Christian people like me out of their money. I answer to a higher power!."" It scares me how I remember some of the things she had said word for word. But I do remember clearly that shirt she was wearing and the final thing she said to me. ""I pray for you. Because you need it.""

Needless to say. All the shouting drew attention to the check out lines. Customers and other employees stood and watched  . No one said a word. However Taylor Swift once again blared over the PA system ""Trouble trouble trouble! Oh! OHHH! Trouble Trouble!"" Finally the event was over and she dragged herself out of the store. The other customers looked at me.

""I can... I can help the next customer in line."" I spoke with a shaking voice. I still didn't know what happened. Like I was in a  car accident and wasn't able to cope with the situation that had occurred. The next customer walked up and smiled. 

""I'm so sorry that woman was so irate with you! You poor thing! She wasn't really a christian woman now was she?"" The old lady was friendly and understanding. Until I noticed she was wearing the same shirt. My heart felt like it stopped. ""I have a couple of coupons to use."" she said.

kingtigerii,20,17,1r00fh,87,"Or ""How we just got skimmed by an EF-2 tornado and you want your pictures.""


Sunday we had some bad weather roll through the area and the cell moving our way was a tornado spawner. When the inevitable tornado sirens sounded I called a manager and let them know. The following is a round about as to what happened next:

**4:15pm:** Sirens sound for the county. manager called.

**4:30pm:** Store Director makes announcement that warning is in place. Tells customers to wait for second announcement in 5 minutes.

**4:35pm:** Announcement is made again that the Store Director suggests we take cover.

**4:36pm:** Manager suggests we unplug the photo kiosks to prevent electrical damage.

**4:37pm:** In the middle of the phone call with the manager, she yells ""OH GOD THE DOORS!"" and hangs up. At this time I hear a loud explosion type noise and rumbling. 

Instinct kicks in and I start screaming at people to get in the back cram as many people in the bathrooms as possible.

**4:40pm:** People are trying to calm the screaming cashiers and employees (The customers were super calm - go figure...) and I get paged over the intercom. It's the manager, and she sounds like she's shaken up badly. Wants me to watch my cell phone and radar.

**4:50pm:** Try calling employee who is in at 5pm. He's like a brother so I'm worried he was driving in. Texting mom and other coworker. Not sure of damage to store.

**4:55pm:** Getting sick of waiting in a hot and crowded bathroom with screaming cashiers, panic filled environment isn't helping my coworker so i take her out too. Radar says storm is passed. No contact with co-worker who is due in at 5pm.

*- Time line stops*

So I wander up to the front of the store to find that the roof is leaking in various spots, but no major damage is done like many were saying. Cashiers made it sound like the front of the store had collapsed, when in reality it had simply taken roof damage and the glass awnings on the front of the store were gone (later we found they had rolled atop the roof, causing the damage).

No sooner do I reach the front entrance when my buddy shows up laughing and soaking wet. We joked around about it, I explained what happened and we got to work roping off the middle of the store which was leaking badly (Burst pipe and holes in the roof over the clothing department).

As we are roping everything off and making sure nobody plays in the water, my phone rings. 

Now mind you, we have emergency only power, there are no registers open and the employees are thinking the management closed the store down until we can make sure nothing collapses or hurts anyone. Around the store, there are red phones that call an employee in the the department in which the phone is located.


It's a customer (C for short). Turns out we're still open...go figure.

**C** - ""Hi there is nobody back here and we want our pictures!""

**Me** - ""Ma'am, there is nobody to help you back there because all available employees are assisting in cleanup and funneling customers out of the store. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. I woul -""

The customer then hung up on me, and the phone rings again.

**C** - ""Hi, can somebody come back here and give me my pictures?""

**Me (attempting to do 12 things at once and make sure the dumb kid at my feet isn't playing in the possibly electrified water):** ""Ma'am, the roof is leaking. Nobody can help you, photo is closed. Please come back another day. Sorry, have a great night."" 

I hung up. Few minutes later a couple teens walked by and were griping about shitty service.



So my buddy and I get the department and most of the leaks roped off. Manager calls and wants us to caution tape the front of the store outside (where the glass awnings are missing, in case anything falls). I get cracking on that and avoid the reporter outside asking question on what happened.

Next crisis, we are still apparently open and need to close, so we need to get customers checked out and out of the store. I hop on lane and start with a transaction when the register looses power midway through. There goes part of the emergency power. Crap.

My buddy is still open on the lane he jumped on so I help him with a couponer (seriously, she had a book. Could have smacked her but we both kept smiling) and got the store cleared out. 

Signs get posted and we shut the doors. Clean up time.

Employees start grabbing shop-vacs off the shelves, squeegees and anything else that can help like mops and buckets. Others are pulling damaged product from the shelves and putting fallen things back up where they go.

It's about 9:30pm when we get another announcement, from another Store Director. The store is reopening at Midnight. It comes as a demoralizing blow because instead of working towards cleanup, we realize we are all simply here to reopen quick as possible and make the company more money. Most of the people on overtime started to leave because they just stopped caring. I decided to stay until my buddy left, couldn't leave him alone with the mess.

Normal cleanup until around 10:30pm, when the Store Director from the previous announcement announces that we are now open for business. My buddy and I look at each other and the still massive pool of water on the ground and decide we've had enough. We pick up our mess and tell the nearest manager we're leaving. I've got two hours of overtime and my buddy has an 8am class. She tells us to put some stuff back really quick and get out. By the time this was completed it was 11pm. We were tired, wet and hungry.

Apparently the EF-2 ""skipped"" over the store, causing only minor damage compared to the industrial complex it wrecked prior to the store and the houses and drive-in movie theater that were leveled after the store. Thankfully it also missed the two hospitals that are next to the store.


**TL:DR: Met a man made of tin, scarecrow and a talking lion and we skipped down a brick road to meet a wizard.**

talesfromesalesthrow,12,22,1r6n0m,91,"Apologies for the length. I just needed this out of my system. Since I've only experienced support on this sub, I need to get this out there. 

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Queue Asshole-Negger. Let's call him A.N. for short. 
A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking."" 



Label that with a big NOPE.JPG and send it off to the printers!

GrimGuy,29,15,1r0zg2,89,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

ChestyPetite,21,25,1qq95t,85,"I am a young girl and  I work at a self serve frozen yogurt joint. It's a new locally owned business that sells some pretty delicious yogurt. I have worked here for two months and sometimes there would be this kid that would come in who would never buy anything, beg for samples, and hang out from open to close (and often sleep) on our couch. Our boss is totally okay with this for some reason and he leaves us girls alone for the most part so nobody complains.  He is obviously homeless but not starving because he is overweight. Early twenties. 

So back track to Halloween. The kid comes in and likes to do this thing where he will walk up behind a big group of people who I am handing sample cups to, to seem less awkward when he begs. I feel sorry for him today and decide to give him my shift meal under the condition that he never asks me for samples again. Big mistake. So he gets his yogurt and sits down right next to me at the cash register to eat. I wanted to be friendly because I felt bad for the guy so I asked him some questions about his life and recommended that the could go to the library and study interesting things or read or something because he had a lot of time on his hands. I mean this kid literally just sits and watches our shop tv from 10 am to 10 pm. 

For some reason he starts to ask me questions, and gets aggressive about it. He asks me if I want to see his resume, and angrily repeats ""WHY NOT"" when I say I am busy and I have no reason to. Then he asks me if I want babies some day. I tell him that that is not an appropriate question and I don't want to answer it. This is all met with ""JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION"". I eventually said no and at this point I'm just playing with my phone trying to stop this conversation. ""What are you doing on your phone. Are you texting? Who are you texting? JUST TELL ME"" I just say I'm browsing, and I'm using all of my body language to show him that I don't want to talk anymore. For now he leaves me alone but just stares at me until my shift is over and walks away when the next employee shows up. 

My next shift is a few days later and of course he is there again. Of course he asks for sample cups and of course he plays dumb when I remind him of our agreement. I brush him off and ring up some customers, so he recedes to sit at the front on the couch like he always does. Here's where the fun starts. 

I go to the back after a few hours of being behind the register to refill some raspberries. When I get to the toppings bar I see that our homeless friend has sample cups in hand and is stealing yogurt. I tell him that he can't do that and that he is stealing. "" I'm not doing anything wrong, everybody gets sample cups!"" And looks at customers (who are uncomfortable at this point) for support. ""You are here every day and you buy nothing, begging for sample cups every time a shift ends and a new employee comes in. You can't do that, and you need to throw those away."" He just smiles at me and acts dumb. ""No. I'm not doing anything wrong."" 

I get frustrated and text my boss, who says it's my fault because I left sample cups on the counter. This makes me petty angry because that's where he keeps them when he works and not a single employee keeps them anywhere else. My boss tells me to leave the dude alone. Whatever. 

The next day rolls around and I'm back at work. At this point I've talked to some of the girls who work there about homeless dude and every single one has a story of him doing something strange like that in the last couple of days. While I'm chatting with my coworker ""M"" about the problems I've had, the dude walks into the store. He tries to wave and I just shake my head at him. He smiles and gets closer and waves again. I just shake my head. He then sits down at the closest seat to the register and continues to stare at me. M excuses herself to use the restroom, leaving me all alone with this guy. 

He tries to talk to me and I look at him mid sentence and just shake my head. At this point, HE STARTS TO CRY.  I ignore him and play with my phone, so he purposely tries to cry LOUDER.  I ignore him and tolerate his ridiculously creepy staring until my second coworker arrives and I beg her  to let me work back. 
     At this point I text my boyfriend who gets angry and comes in to sit with me for the rest of my shift. All is well at this point. Boyfriend stared him down until he left his spot and went back to the couch to watch tv. He leaves us alone for the most part but occasionally gets up to watch us though the reflection of the store front windows. 

Closing time has rolled around and all customers have left. I come out of the back after a day of mopping and dish washing to watch the register while my coworker uses the restroom. Boyfriend is still sitting and doing his homework. This is when I see homeless dude stand up from laying on the couch. He begins to walk incredibly slowly over towards where I am standing. After getting about 7 feet away, he stops and stares at me. At this point I am shaking. I have no idea what he wants and I am incredibly uncomfortable with him. I do not feel supported by my boss because I have been told that he is allowed to stay for as long as he wants. I muster up all of my strength and in a monotone voice ask ""can I help you with anything?"" He shakes his head no at me. ""Unfortunately, we have to close the shop..."" He turns around and very slowly walks towards the door, only leaving after staring at us for a minute. 

I lock the door and call my boss in tears, who tries to convince me nothing is wrong and that I can only ask him to leave if he is bothering customers. It takes 20 minutes for him to give me permission to ask him to leave if I am personally uncomfortable.

bekahbbydoll,24,18,1qqw6j,87,"I would like to take this time to praise my front end manager. I came in an hour late because of a miscommunication with another manager. The phone call I received was anything but nice and professional, but I'm not here to talk about that. 

So after I came in I didn't let my foul mood try to get in the way of doing my job, I was super polite to guests and professional. My front end manager could tell something was up though. She asked what was wrong and I told her. She apologized profusely and told me that she was so sorry that it happened. 

Fast forward about 4 hours. A guest brought in some boots that she bought online. She didn't like that they had a colored zipper on the back. She bought them for like 35 bucks. When she returned them the price got reduced to $8.07. The boots were my size and I was dying to have them. I had mentioned this to my front end manager. But then realized that I didn't have enough cash on me to be able to use my team member discount. 

I was a little bummed. I knew someone else would snatch them up in no time because of the killer savings. My manager asked why I wasn't going to buy them and I told her I just didn't have the money to. Even though they were super cheap. So i go on break a little bummed.

I come back from break and my manager is holding a bag out to me. I asked her if it was a paid and left and she shook her head. I looked at her quizzically. She nods her head down at the bag and says 'look inside.' I open the bag and low and behold it's the boots! I look up at her and I'm just in awe. She told me it was no big deal, she knew I was having a bad day and that I really wanted the boots. I just had to promise that I would wear them tomorrow. I practically ran around the counter to hug her. It was the nicest thing anyone that I work with has ever done for me. I seriously almost started crying. 

**TL;DR:** had a crappy day, manager cheered me up by buying me boots I wanted and just being all around amazing.

Vasite,9,20,1qzps2,83,"Background: I work in a retail store that has fairly small (in my opinion) pillars around the store to hold it up for support. Well to make it look nicer we have put glass mirrors on the 4 sides of the square pillar. Now i have seen these glass pillars chipped before. It doesn't look like your average fragile glass this stuff looks thick and tough to probably avoid easy damage. 

Story: I'm usually a PoS (register/customer service) employee so i'm rarely on the floor. Well today i was needed on the floor due to some call outs. I'm speaking with a customer about some men's shirts and clearance items pretty close to our shoes department.

~Note we wear little headsets on the floor to communicate to each other for various things

Over my headset i hear that a small child has cut himself on glass in the shoe department and i say i'd run over and help since i was really close.  As i'm walking over i can hear a bloody scream coming from the department and i got to thinking. 

""wait a minute, glass, we don't have glass anywhere in shoes. What could he have possibly cut himself on?"" 

I finally get there and oh my god, there's blood everywhere. I can clearly see where the kid has been and what happened. There is a blood puddle right on/next to the glass pillar. I quickly get to the child being held by his mother, trying to close the 1-1/2 inch gash on his forehead. I quickly run off to the backroom for band aids/wipes/ whatever i could find. It wasn't much sadly. 

By this time the parents aren't really saying anything but to help them while calming down the child, I'm not really thinking much of it because the amount of blood all over the department. The manager and some other associates have managed to get over there by now and were taking him to the restroom to clean him up.

Now that the kid (still screaming) have went to the restroom i page the cleaning lady to help me get the blood out of everything. Now i can get a good look and what may have happened. Our glass pillar in the shoe department is wedged in between 2 giant shelves of shoes. There is maybe 2 inchs of space between the pillar and shelf, no enough room for anybody to move through. The pillar has been chipped so i inform the manager that the child may have glass in the wound so the parents would know. 

Then a lady grabs my attention, asking to tell me something:

Lady: Ms. Vasite? (i have a nametag on)

Me: yeah? what can i do for you?

Lady: That little boy was sprinting all throughout the shoes, i asked the parents to watch him but they didn't care, and he ran right into the pillar. I saw the whole thing.

Me: thank you, i'll inform the manager. 

Now by this time i'm used to the fact parents let their kids run wild in the store and maybe this will teach them they need to watch him more. I head back to the restroom to wash off anything i may have gotten on my hands and see the parents signing, again SIGNING a form saying we, the store, are not at fault for this accident. They leave soon after and i was just chatting to the manager about what the women had said and i went on with my day

Now here's the funny part. I come into work the next day to find out that the parents are ""trying"" to sue us for their son's head wound. On the grounds of ""The pillar shouldn't have been there"" Really? What else are we suppose do with a support beam for the building? Lord.",It's the stores fault that pillar is there.,103
Senoritallama,17,14,1qwrd6,86,"Saturday nights get pretty busy and on Saturday nights I usually work drive-thu. We get so busy the line of cars is wrapped around the building and sometimes out to the street. So me and who ever is in drive-thru try to get the line moving as fast as we can without being rude to the customers because usually people get pretty pissy about waiting in such a long line and I don't blame them.
Last Saturday night we got pretty busy. I was taking money at the window and my friend was taking the orders and we had someone running them. 
The next order came up that was a double-cheeseburger basket and a large drink was exactly $10. An older man pulls up to the window and I say,""Hello, sir. Your total is $10.""
The man doesn't say anything and just reaches in his pocket and pulls out a handful of change and dumps it on the ledge and says, ""Count it out."" 
I stood there for a full 30 seconds in shock.
I start counting it out and it's not nearly enough. He gave me $4.36. I open the window and say, ""Sir, I still need $5.64.""
He doesn't say anything to me just mumbles to himself how stupid I am that I can't count. He pulls out his wallet and throws me a $10 bill. I put it in my draw and hand the food to him.

""M'am, is that... Your dog?"" I asked, because we aren't allowed to have pets in the store, although I am not sure that rule applies when the dog is in a baby carrier.

dogfacegremlin,6,12,1r5qvo,83,"***Background****
Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

**TL;DR - Caught a guy from my HS stealing; asked me if we got him good, showed him his theft video. Year later same dude busted robbing a bank.**

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16.  Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure.  He wants desperately to be cool. He’s got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid …

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid’s church bow tie and his wife’s apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I’m bagging groceries. It’s Labor Day, so I’m constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

“Hey, are you unmined?”

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She’s my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

“Yeah?” Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and “yeah” is all I can manage.

“I’m Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].”

“That’s cool.” I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I’ve known since elementary school.
“You working all day today?”

“Yeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.”

“Bummer. We’re having a pool party. You could have come.”

Now I’m really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I’m here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I’m totally scared of talking to girls.

“I wish I could. I hope you’re having a good time.”

“It’s good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.”

“Well, maybe we can do something next week.” Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

“Totally. You have a pen?”

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I’m both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy’s Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

“Call me. We’ll set something up.”

“Great, thanks!”

“See you later!” She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it’s all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I’m feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I’m so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom’s stash (don’t do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she’s just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said “I’m bummed. This went by took quickly.”

“It has,” I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR … next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I’d give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it’s indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I’ll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","”Bag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2” or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",132

""well could it be in back?""
""No, but, I can go look up on our PC and see if we even have it in stock""

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

I tell her

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

I know it's not in back, it's not got a home and it's not even being carried at our stores. I look anyways and it's not there.

I know you do have it because the ad I read it and they wouldn't lie"".

I reluctantly call a manager. About 30 mins afterwards Ted the Store Manager comes around. I hate Ted and so does everyone else. Ted is arrogant and unreasonable and runs the store with an iron fist. He comes up to me, and says a flat ""What do you want?"" I explain the issue and then the lady asks why it's not in stock.

Ted looks at her, and then looks at the PC and then looks at me. 

""I'm sorry ma'am we do not carry this movie at all. Perhaps i could find you another movie. There is no other reason. We can not order X we do not even carry the movie.""

""Would another X carry it or was it just this store that's slow?""

""no. If it's not on our database that means we do not carry it""

'Donna' has been working at this store for ~8 years.  Huge inflated ego, talks to everyone like they're 5, and stupid (she was a school teacher), basically has piss-poor customer service skills and a non-existent work ethic.  She finally gave her two weeks a few days ago because apparently me and other people there made it too difficult for her to work there**.

Today she's sitting at a table next to the register, not on break, and she answers her cell.  There's line forming; 2, 3, now it's 6 deep.  She's still on the phone.

She spends 5 hours ordering what takes me 30 minutes, and she'll spend that same time completely changing what I've ordered when I was asked too.

Most people have said ""I bet you're made up!"" But really, no, I like my late shifts. Sure, of a night there is more alcoholics and drug addicts to deal with and stuff, but most of the managers go home at 6 and a lot of the people who work the closing shifts are my age and I get on with everyone a lot better.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is Finance ... Shall we begin?**

I’ve written before about being wholly unprepared for some of the “human elements” of being a manager. This is another case. Shit like this is just not covered in business school, but it should be. So I’ll lay it out, tell you what I did, and invite your comments in hopes it may help others.

“Enid” was a middle-aged woman who was hired to service accounts over the phones. I did not hire her, but I didn’t object. Her background suggested she’d be a good fit.

She breezed through training without issue. She was assigned a cubicle not far from my own cube.

It only took a few days on the”floor” before the crazy started.

Enid complained to her supervisor that insects where biting her. The bugs were living under her desk. It was making her work difficult.

Supervisor wait until Enid leaves for the day and does an inspection. He sees nothing. On his way out he dropped by and told me what was going on.

On the off chance there was an actual infestation, I put in a work order to have the area sprayed down over the weekend. Supervisor passed this along to Enid, and she seemed satisfied.

I should pause her to say that we tried to go way out of our way to make sure phone people were happy. Especially new hires. Even if there might be a touch of crazy. Once we hired someone and put her/him through training, we’ve spend close to $20,000 developing the person.

So Enid was going to get white glove treatment.

The weekend came and went. The whole area (not just her desk) was sprayed, vacuumed and dusted. Clean.

Within two hours of Monday’s shift, Enid was back at Supervisor’s desk. Bugs. Still there. She made it a point to show a calf full of bug bites to Supervisor (who did not need to see that).

We waited for Enid to go to lunch. Then we both crawled around looking for bugs. We even pulled up an outlet and inspected the raised-floor space for bugs.

No bugs.

We even asked her cube neighbors if they had any problems. Nope.

At this point, I conceded that we may be dealing with a hiring mistake.

Supervisor told Enid that we’ve inspected, sprayed, inspected again, and verified with others; there was nothing we could find. There was little he could think of doing to make the situation better.

She became really pissed-off and walked into my cube.

“I’m being eaten alive and nobody is doing a damn thing about it!”

“I’m sorry Enid. I’m sure you feel bad, but we can’t find anything, and we can’t do much beyond spraying. We’ve not able to find the source of what is biting you.”

“I can’t work in this kind of environment.”

Okay … I’ll try one other tactic. “Here’s what we can do. I’ll have you move to another desk. We have a few others open. I’ll make sure there are no insects before we move you. Just give me a couple hours.”

We found he another cube, and had our facilities manager confirm it was bug free. He also gave the area a light dusting of pesticide. We gave it an hour to air out and moved Enid into her new space.

Tuesday comes. Enid is back in my doorway. “They are still here! I can see them! They are tiny white bugs and they are still biting me. I’m going to the doctor.”

No objections to her leaving to seek medical help. I hoped that the doctor would give her some insight that I could use to resolve the matter. I also went looking for white bugs. No bugs.

Wednesday morning, Enid approaches Supervisor. She pulls her pants down just a bit, exposing a scabies-infected splotch at the top of her butt-cheek.

“I got scabies from working here!” she insisted. (Note, if you feel like throwing up today, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies).

I asked her to go see our occupational nurse. Off she went. The nurse calls an hour later.

“Did she tell you she has scabies?”

“Yup.” I said.

“There’s no chance she got it here. It’s transmitted from direct contact with an already infected person. Unless she’s sitting on someone’s lap, the odds of picking it up at a cube are tiny.”

“Okay. Is she coming back up?”

“She’s on her way.”

Enid appears a minute later.

“I don’t know what to do. I’m being eaten alive by a parasite and nobody wants to help.”

I give Enid a quick review of what we’ve done to mitigate the problem.

“So what’s next?” She asks.

“We can’t do anything else. We’ve done all we can to accommodate you. There is simply nothing left to be done. I’m sorry you’re having a rough time, but I have to ask you to return to your desk now and begin working.”

“Fine.”

From this point forward, she got no additional support on the issue. She bitched and moaned for a few more weeks, and then finally quit with a vague threat of impending lawsuits. We were never actually sued, and never heard from her again.

BuffHipster,3,10,1r556k,70,"Was suggested to cross post here from [this AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r2b9l/whats_the_most_insulting_thing_you_ever_said_to). My buddy destroyed an asshole customer with a solid one-sentence send off. Enjoy!

&gt;Not me, but my friend. He was at work, and apparently some asshole customer was berating a new employee, like new as in fresh out of training. This customer was a repeat offender to this type of stuff, people who work retail know the type. My buddy, having worked there for a year or two, comes up and tells the new employee, ""Go, I'll take care of this."" Before the customer can tear into him, he said in a quiet voice, ""Your business is not worth your bullshit and the world would be a better place without you.""

&gt;Customer left speechless.

So bonus post-story stuff, I guess... so far, my buddy hasn't gotten in trouble for it, which he totally could as he is not a manager. As for context, the customer was using profanity and being blatantly unreasonable. This poor new employee literally walked out of the training room to go the bathroom, and customer asked him a question, and then proceeded to ""How could you not know where this is? What fucking use are you? *BLAH BLAH BLAH SO MAD*.""

AdriValkyrie,39,17,1r5ewi,69,"I work in a restaurant in a fairly rich town, in the suburbs of a large city, and for some reason, people feel entitled to make that comment to me all the time. I'm a rather short (5'3""), and slim girl, so I definitely do not give off a ""strong"" vibe (I am much more so than most people think though, that type of job definitely can keep you in shape).

 Most of the time, it's older customers who seem almost worried for me, as in a ""are you sure that's not too heavy for you?"" when I'm clearing off a table. Yes, I can, otherwise I would not be carrying all of this, that would be silly. I appreciate the concern, but no need to make comments.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

One of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while I'm lifting it, and says ""You shouldn't do that! You're a girl! You're not nearly strong enough to do that!"" I just stared at him, then proceeded to dump the ice in the sink, and walked away, while he looked stunned. His friend, on the other hand, started shaking his head, embarrassed by his friend.

I just want to know how people think this is ok? Seriously, making comments about whether or not I can do my job is not cool, and please don't throw in sexist remarks either.

Just as commenting about my weight is not acceptable either. Would you comment about the fact that someone was overweight? No, you would not. So please don't comment on me, either.

For a majority of the time, I've been the designated punching bag (aka ""guest services"") in the store. I run the phones, announcements, returns, special orders, cashiering, complaints, etc. in my little box. 

Today was a surprisingly slow day, but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out. We had a line of maybe 6 or 7 parties, and I was checking people out along with 2 other cashiers. Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns. Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

*She went and grabbed one of our reusable bags*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

ME: ""..kay. Your total is [total]."" *she pays me in cash*

I had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change, but I restrained myself!

HER: ""That cashier is so nasty."" *leaves*

After closing, I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people ""oh you don't mind do you?"" as she pushed past, yelled at the cashier for ""blinding her"" with the red scanner light, and tried to get her to give her a discount without a coupon.

Needless to say, we were not sad to see her go.

Sigillite,15,22,1qxrkh,66,"For the past couple of months I have been working at a restaurant in my hometown. I had been let down by being told by my college that I wouldnt be able to get a position which would have gotten me out of the service industry for good.

That same day though I walked in after seeing their ad posted, got an interview, and an offer all within a half hour! Awesome! Turned my day right around. For about a month all was well.

The owner ""Mike"" was great; came from the service side so he was flexible with staff, great with guests, and ran a really tight ship. One of my favorite managers of any job. His wife ""Stephanie,"" though, was just awful. She was great at the business and catering side of the restaurant, but get her anywhere near a guest, or come to her with an issue, and she would find some way to make it worse.

My training was next to nothing, aside from learning the menu and showing me around. It was a new computer system and thanks to that, I would make mistakes that would piss her off, yet how am I supposed to know the proper procedure if noone ever told me in the first place?? The way that they did add-ons or changes to a menu item was not what I was used to, yet noone told me what I was doing was wrong until more than two months into the job.

She also would constantly talk down to the wait staff. I dunno how to explain it, but every time she had a criticism or asked us to do something it was like she had asked us to do it twenty times before and we were all the stupidest people in the world. When I didnt know the ordering procudure, for example, she said ""You've been here for a while shouldnt you know this already?"" Well, no, you ass, because I only had four days of training and the people who trained me were fired not a week after I started!

Red flags all over the place.

I'm also in grad school, which is so far above this stupid job on my priorities list I have to decompress on my way home or I'll get the bends. What's unusual about my program though is that we have 7 week terms. I started in August, and so my availability originally had me working about 6 shifts a week. It was just too much on top of the grad school workload, which was much more than I had anticipated. I asked to reduce my shifts to only 3, on thursday friday and saturday mornings. Lunch is busy, so I made plenty of money for what I needed and they seemed ok with it.
When my class schedule changed though, I couldnt work thursday mornings anymore. I told them that a week before it changed, and I was still scheduled thursday. No big deal, I left class early and was there on time. Next week, same thing. I left class early and reminded Stephanie that my availability had changed and I couldnt work thursday mornings moving forward. She made a big huff and acted like changed the schedule was the worst thing in the world. Apparently, it is really hard to move people around because ""everyone has the shifts that they like"" and ""Not a lot of people can work thursdays.""

Keep in mind that they havent replaced 4 servers that have left in the two months I have been there. It is me and three other waiters, the rest are bartenders. 
Sorry, not my fault. I open up my availability so that I could work any night of the week, friday and saturday mornings, as long as I kept my three shift a week schedule. 

So last week I wasnt scheduled for anything... weird... computer systems being what they are though I assume its a mistake. I can still log in online and see the schedule but Im not on it. I call the restaurant and the hostess tells me that I am not on the schedule. Ok, what the fuck? Are you really doing this? I wait until its been two weeks with no schedule to call back and ask to talk to her. And she wont talk to me. What the hell man, be unprofessional and let me know Im fired by not scheduling me fine, but at least tell me WHY.

She really pissed me off through this whole thing so I was thinking of a way to get back at them, and my girlfriend suggested filing for unemployment benefits which will cause their federal unemployment tax to go up, whether I get the benefits or not, because of their high turnover rate.

shadowmanwkp,12,19,1r1q8g,59,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around €2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.

AshieeRose,20,19,1qz7qx,54,"Some context, but it isn't pretty. Last week I had police and paramedics called to my house because I was suicidal. After a psych-evaluation, I'm released, with 3 days ordered off of work. 

My last post was work forcing me to cancel my trip to see my SO in USA over Christmas, lest I be fired. That combined with stresses at home and some more stresses at work, and my cat dying, I lost it. Completely. 

My first shift back was today. 2 minutes before my shift started, I'm paged - twice - in ten seconds, as I'm walking up one of the aisles. 

Strike one. 

After a couple hours, I'm told to take a break. I questioned it since I'm not meant to get a break for 4 hours, but they let me go (Are you sure? Yes, yes, go on.), so I went. 

I'm paged in the break room. I ignore it, since my 15 mins wasn't up. I'm paged again as I'm walking to the registers.

Supervisor: You weren't meant to get a break.

Me: ... You just told me to go on break. 

Supervisor: Yeah, but you only work 4 hours. You're not meant to get a break.

Me: Well, who told you I had to go on break?? I didn't. 

Supervisor: She (manager) must have stuffed up. 

HOW IS THAT MY FAULT?!

I go back to my register, freaked out and on the verge of tears. Eventually I get told to move to a closer register. Okay. Oh, wait, can you go into the box (express+tobacco)? Okay, I can kill time by stocking up the cigarettes. WAIT, can you take the baskets around?

Alright, I'll take the baskets around. **ASH,** there's a customer at Register 6, take them through!!

Fuck sake. I'm one person. I'm sorry I can't split myself into several Ash's. I race out to the bathroom, busting to go, I'm not even washing my hands before I'm paged again.

You fucking wonder why I wanted to kill myself. Why I was too ashamed to tell you why I had 3 days of sick leave. Why I get anxiety attacks at work, why I feel so stressed and just want to hide from everyone. 

It's not even the customers here, that's what's hilarious.

Seventy_Times7,2,11,1qq7et,57,"Yesterday was the Playstation 4 launch, and I headed into work expecting things to be insane by the time I arrived for my 5pm-1am shift. I work in electronics, and was going to be one of the 3 guys working past midnight. To my surprise, things were pretty calm. I started to work with my friend/coworker to get everything PS4-y ready for the night. It was all going swimmingly for a couple hours. 

Then, she showed up.

One of our ""regulars"" is in electronics trying to pull a locked up 40"" TV off the shelf. She's a loud, slightly balding, skinny, red-headed woman in her mid to late 30s who has been suspected of trying to steal stuff multiple times. Usually she has her 6-7 year old daughter (who is adorable) with her, and is constantly screaming at the poor girl for ""touching things."" My coworkers roll their eyes and one motions for me to go ""deal"" with her.

Because she's about to pull a bunch of 40"" HDTVs down on herself, I run up to her. ""Hi ma'm, let me help you with that!""

""I don't need you're help."" She replies flatly.

I sigh a little. ""If you'd like me to take care of that TV for you, I have unlock it first.""

At this point, I expect her to argue that she has more shopping to do, so she has to take it with her (which I can't let her do). But instead she turns around and looks at me, sizing me up for a brief moment.

""Oh... Well is this a good TV? We need a new one for our living room.""

I go on to tell her that she has actually chosen my favorite TV in that size range. She looks at me with an eyeroll and states ""Yeah I bet you'd say that if I had chosen anything else high-priced."" (it is the highest priced 40"" we carry)

I happily state ""Oh no ma'm, I'm not a salesman of any kind. I mean, I don't make commission or anything, and I know a good bit about our TVs. You actually chose what I would buy if I had to choose a 40"" TV from here."" I had given her the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I brace for another sarcastic reply but instead she looks at me again, and silently walks to our displays.

I expect this to be the end of our chat. But then, she turns and asks for my help. I turn to see my coworkers looking at me with wide eyes and raised eyebrows. This is a first.

I never expected things to go well, but we ended up having a great 20 minute conversation about the various brands we carry, the differences between TV types (plasma, LED, LCD), refresh rates, and what Smart TV really means. I expected all the info to go straight over her head, but she understood it all pretty well. It turned out that despite seeming ignorant and rude, she knows a fair bit, and is a pretty quick learner.

After we finished discussing everything and looking at the upcoming Black Friday deals, she did something we've never seen her do before. As she left, she turned and said ""Thank you! You were a great help!"" and then, she SMILED. 

My coworkers were speechless, and I was ""more than happy to help"".","A happy ending to an encounter with one of THOSE ""regulars"" (:",68

As they were getting to the seat, I heard them grumbling about how the mom wasn't eating. I figured, not my business, shouldn't care. 

About **15** minutes after they got their food, the dad came up and glared at me (He was a big guy; could have been a lumberjack). It was clear that he was trying his best to contain himself and not go full out yelling at me. He told me I never gave his wife a chance to order and it was all my fault. I just said sorry, what can I get for her, etc. He just ordered a cheeseburger, paid, and sat back down. 

Because it was slow, we had it 5 seconds after he sat down (all the way across the room). I called his name, and he was genuinely pissed about having to get back up to retrieve it. I would have brought it over, but he practically ran to get it.

Again, after 15 minutes, he came up and slammed on the counter, yelling ""BOSS!"". My manager, who was 5 feet away, turned around. I had other customers so I couldn't hear all the conversation, but basically the burger was supposed to have no onion and he wanted a refund for the burger along with saying that I should have given it for free anyway since I had made a mistake. With people like this, pretty much all the managers turn a blind eye, since it's clearly not me. I gotta say, I have some pretty good managers.

TL;DR family orders, dad doesn't let mom order. Dad comes later saying it's my fault mom didn't order. Then he says I messed up the **single item** order and gets my manager.",I don't usually get bad customers in my small town working the front desk.,69
Tehbrainz,20,11,1qxzpk,54,"I work in a craft store part time while im taking classes at the local Community College. While i was in the middle of my lecture, i noticed my boss called me twice. My Professor is really big on the ""no cell phones in lecture policy"". After class ended i called him back to see what all the fuss was about. He starts ranting at me saying how i should be alert for his calls wherever i am (because you know, im batman /s). After he was done ranting he said how i'm an irresponsible employee. The same day i go home to check my schedule for the next week and i see that I'm only working one day out of the entire 7 day week.

I put in my two weeks notice at the big box pet retail store not long after I accepted a job as a teller at a local bank. I just wanted to share something that happened yesterday that was pretty much one of the most ridiculous things I've been asked. Not dramatic, just ridiculous.

So this older woman walks in the door and up to my register. She holds out her hand and says, ""Can you tell me what kind of treat this is?"" She's holding a single treat. No bag, no nothing. Just the treat. Coincidentally I had bought the same kind for my dog before, so I showed her exactly where they were. I made my way back to the register. 

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws). Thankfully I'm out of this place in 24 hours, tomorrow is my last day and I'm only doing pricing stuff before we open. ","Friday is my last day.

Niggarachi,20,12,1qyp1f,54,"I work as a valet supervisor in grand City of Sin at a timeshare resort. It's a very interesting job as I see the strangest things almost nightly. I work the graveyard shift. It's not really pleasant but it gives me an opportunity to study for exams and browse Reddit.

A quick background in how my valet service operates: We are required to park your car safely upon your arrival to the hotel. We bring your car to you as quickly and safely as possible when you ask for it. 

That's it. You want some special treatment? There should be SOMETHING put in my hand when you get your car.

As a courtesy to some of our nicer customers. If we notice that they come down at the same time on consecutive mornings, we'll offer to have it brought down at the time they come down for the duration of their stay. It's just something that helps us clear our garage as well as enhance our tip potential.

When I returned to work, one of my co-workers told me of this guy driving a Nissan Juke. He was slated to stay with us for two weeks. He had showed up on my day off and had requested that his car be waiting for him at the same time, 4:30, every morning. No problem with that. 

But he never, ever, ever tipped. Nothing, nada, zilch. 

So 4:30 rolls around and JukeAss comes down. He doesn't hand me his claim check, but tells it to me.

JA: 807

Me: Ok. May I see your claim check. 

JA: It's 807, you guys already know me. And where is my car?

Me: I don't know who you are sir. I've never seen you before. So for my safety and yours I need to see your claim check.

JA: You know who I am. Just bring me my car.

ME: Sir I don't know you. I cannot just bring down your car without seeing your claim check. For all I know, you happened to be sitting here with someone else and memorized those numbers. I cannot give away a car like that.


He rustles through his wallet and pulls out his claim check

JA: Here it is.

ME: Alright sir, I'll have it down for you right away.

JA: Next time it better be down here before I get here. 

ME: I'm sorry sir. I'm not required to do that for you. We do offer you a FREE valet service. (Emphasis on the free hoping he'd understand that just a dollar here or there would help his chances)

JA: But you guys have had it down the last two nights. Let me speak to your supervisor.

(Love hearing those words)

ME: I am the supervisor. It is not part of our service to have your car down at a specific time. Maybe someone did you a FAVOR last time. But I cannot do that.

At this time, his Juke is brought down. He leaves without another word spoken. We never had his car down again and he never tipped us. Fine by me. Don't expect extra service when you aren't paying the piper.

biohzrd451,11,12,1r61h1,52,"Hello there first time poster long time reader. This is going back to the summer of 2001 when I was pulling a stint in a Mom and Pop pizza joint in a small town.

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box. I mean the dude threw a full on temper tantrum and slung his boxes across the counter making a huge mess.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

BraveSouls,10,16,1qwppq,51,"First post to TFR! It's a bit long, sorry!


**Some background:** I work for a privately owned consignment shop. For those that don't know, it's a second-hand shop (though we also sell new items), but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them. We take the items in and once they sell, we get a commission off the sale, and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

I've been working there for a few weeks now, and I love it. My boss, the owner, is awesome and most of the items we have are really cool and interesting. I learn a lot about all sorts of things when researching the items or from customers coming in. It's the first retail job I've had where I genuinely enjoy working at. Most of the customers are really nice as well, but there's always the select few who could make you want to tighten that noose just a little bit.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

**People that complain they have to pay tax.**

This is one I get the most. I've had people laugh like I'm joking or rolling their eyes that they have to pay sales tax. No really, you DO have to pay the tax. They like to treat us like we're a fancy in-door yard sale, but we're not. It's still a retail shop in a state that charges sales tax. If we have to pay taxes, so do you. Sorry, but that's just how it works.

I had this one guy give me the “really?” look. I'd reply “Yes, sir!” with the big fake smile all of my fellow retail slaves know so well. No harm done, he pays it and is on his way, but still it can be a little irksome. Especially when they give me a hard time about it as they pay. They make like it takes so much effort to get an extra dollar out of their wallet when they've already put it away.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

**Hagglers**

Everyone wants to get the best deal, and I generally don't have a problem with that. We aren't a big box retail store where prices are never negotiable, however as mentioned above we're also not some schmucks selling items out the back of a truck. My boss wants to make the customers happy, but also consider his consignors who drop off the items. Most of which, including myself before I started working for him, are repeat consignors. They'll drop off more items once a month or so, but if they see their items are selling for less than what they were hoping for they may not come back. Depending on how long an item has been in the store, or if the items are abandoned, he might be willing to lower the price if a customer asks for it.   

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

We had this one woman come in looking at a stack of four handmade weaved baskets with tops. They were pretty big, the size of old fashioned picnic baskets (minus the handles), maybe a bit smaller. They didn't have prices on them so when she asked Boss-man said the two bigger ones were $20 a piece while the smaller ones, though still relatively big, were $15 but he'd sell her the lot for $45. Now I know this may seem high to some, but these were quality baskets and they hadn't been used before. I thought it was a good deal anyway.

She fires back “I'll give you $30”

Boss-man politely declines and holds firm at $45, she doesn't buy them and leaves. She wasn't mad or anything that I could tell. Had she proposed $40 he may have gone for it, but there was no way he was going to go for $30, especially given the deal she was already getting.

[](/spacer)   

I haven't gotten any super angry customers as of yet since working there, but my boss has told me some crazy stories. We're also getting into the Christmas shopping season and I'm sure I'll have my own angry customer stories to tell.

GelflingSkeksis,37,23,1qx3dz,49,"Background: 
I work at a retail mall as a diamond pusher. 

Story:
This weekend we had a very popular race in town, which brings in people from all over the country and internationally. Now, I work behind cases. Two gentleman come into the store, one speaking English and the other speaking another language. We will call them ES for English speaker and NS for not speaking.

I show them a few watches from my cases, explaining how the particular brand is pretty awesome. 

NS proceeds to ***reach over the case*** to point out/grab a watch he wanted to see. My reflexes kicked in and I slapped his hand, and pointed my finger in his face, wagging it slightly and shouted ""NO!"" As if he were a dog. I have a dog at home, so I guess that's where my reflex came in. 

He looked at me, shocked. I put the watches up and stared blankly at him. They asked for another brand that I do not carry, so I pointed them to another store. 

Needless to say, I'm sure he'll never try that again.

I really want to pull that tape now and see it all unfold. What an interesting experience.

Note: I don't think he was trying to steal. I think he was from out of country and didn't understand the boundaries that we have grown up here in America to respect. I had no ill will toward him, and probably lost the sale because of it, but I learned a lesson, and I hope he did too. ",I will slap you! [Tales from the Mall],72
starfleetjedi,8,11,1qwqwd,47,"I work for the kind of bakery that manufactures specialized baked goods, which we sell to stores in bulk. Individual consumers can also place smaller orders through our website.

Here's the gist of an email conversation I had with a consumer who placed a web order:

**Consumer**: I placed an order last week and had it sent to my daughter's house for her birthday. Do you know when my package will get to her? It's taking too long. I have attached the order number and the date.

**Me, after checking her order**: Your order was sent to 1234 Main St., New York, NY. It should have arrived yesterday.

**Consumer**: No! Her address is 12**43** Main St., New York, NY. Are you telling me you sent the package to the wrong address and never told me?!

**Me**: You gave us 12**34** Main St. We don't hand write the shipping labels. Our system took the information you gave us and printed the label based on what you typed in.

**Consumer**: I checked Google Maps and that address doesn't even exist. What are you going to do about it? Where is my package? You better refund me or resend my order for free. I am going to dispute the charge on my credit card because I didn't get what I ordered.

**Me**: We don't send web orders through FedEx or UPS, so we don't have tracking numbers. USPS/US mail doesn't give us that option, and they don't contact us when something can't be delivered. The package is most likely on its way back to our facility now. For real, though, it's not our fault. YOU supplied us with the wrong address. YOUR mistake is costing us because now we have un-reshippable cookies coming back, and my manager will probably ship you a new order for fucking free. So next time, check your damn information before you complain to customer support about how stupid you are.

OneWayOfLife,6,15,1quuqs,54,"Alright.

After my first year of retail, I think I'm finally starting to see how customers can really be. And not in the good way.

Today was particularly and unusually rife with people that decided to be as disruptive and blameless as possible. It may be because of Christmas, or because some distant stars have aligned or something, but either way, GAAAHH!!

--------

Firstly, an elderly gentleman comes up to the till next to me and puts all his stuff on the counter of this closed register. Between this till and my own (or more accurately, between me and where he was standing) is a small tower that houses lottery scratch cards. This meant that out of the corner of your eye, you can't tell if it's a person or this tower next to you. So this bloke dumps his stuff down- the paper he wanted to buy and his bag- and proceeds to stand there for several minutes while I'm stood doing nothing (not serving I mean, I was working Vikki! I swear!). Occasionally, people will use un-manned tills as desks to write out lottery tickets/birthday cards etc, so I feel it was perfectly reasonable to assume this is what he was doing. At this time, a queue starts to build. I have to serve relatively quickly to get through all the customers, so I forget this guy is even there. After about the 4th person from the queue, he says in a rather loud, angry tone:

##Cust: I'm sorry, am I completely invisible to you?!

Note that he is stood at an empty register, with an obvious queue for my till. I reply:

##Me: I'm sorry Sir, but there is a queue…

I decide that to not make a scene, I will serve him next. He comes over, and requests the free CD that comes in his newspaper. Now on the front cover, it says in blue letters at least ½ an inch high, that the CDs are available in [Major Supermarket] and [Other Newsagents] but not our store. I call my supervisor, Vikki, over (I hope you don't mind me using your name if you're reading this… :P) and the conversation between her (now V) and the customer ( C ) goes like so:

##V: I'm sorry, but we aren't doing the discs this time.

##C: Yes you are.

##V: We aren't I'm afraid. We haven't down them for a while actually.

##C: Yes you have. It says here. That's false advertising.

##V:We don't do it, sorry.

##C:Errr, yes you do.

##V: only [Supermarket] and [Newsagents] do it, sorry.

##C: Well how am I supposed to get there?!

-- [Supermarket is about a 3 minute walk away…]--

He then pays, and walks away grumpily with no more words uttered.

-------

The second customer that decided that she deserved me to instantly and faultlessly understand what it was she wanted came up to me while in mid conversation on the phone. It should be noted that she had quite a thick (possibly Jamaican) accent. She shall be known as Phone LAdy (PL). She grunts:

##PL: Lyca Mobile!

while thrusting a £10 note at me. Note for non English reditors- Lyca mobile is a telephone provider. We have both the SIM cards and top-ups for this brand, so to make sure I'm doing what she wanted, I clarify with her:

##Me: Is that a top-up for Lyca Mobile?

She half nods, so I process a £10 top-up for Lyca Mobile for her. She leaves and returns about 10 minutes later (yes, it took her that long to notice…):

##PL: Where is my change?

##Me: I'm sorry, what change?

##PL: I gave you £10!!

##Me: That is a £10 top-up…


##PL: I asked quite clearly for a £5 top-up!! I want a refund!!

[We can't refund this]

##Me: I'm sorry, but I can't refund now. You'll have to ring customer services and see what they can do.

##PL: So I have to use my credit to call ip for your mistake when it's all your fault? I want to use your phone!

I went on to accept responsibility and apologised for mishearing her (I didn't, she didn't even specify a top-up, FFS), bust as a friend of mine pointed out, she shouldn't be worried about using her credit to phone CustServices, as she already has £5 more than she expected anyway…

",It's happening!!,69
JizzBeef,9,10,1qrqn5,52,"I work at a very popular gas station/convenience store in the midwest that everybody loves, including the people that work there. (Out of paranoia, I ask for everyone to please respect the Anonymizing Rules) 
So the location I work at can only be described as the worst location in the most entitled part of the state that's in the smack-dab-middle of the United States. And when I say that it's the worst, I don't mean that it's the most entitled location, I mean the complete opposite of that, ie, I see prostitutes and drug deals as well as having to deal with drug addicts and homeless people on a regular basis. Due to this, I have absolutely no tolerance for rude people or for shoplifters or the sort, and oftentimes I come off to many customers as being mean just because I can never let my guard down.

So anyway! I was working an evening shift earlier this week. As I was walking to the back of the store towards our ""supply room,"" an older man wearing a yellow sweater was kind of walking towards me, as well as my new coworker. Due to his yellow sweater, we'll now call him YS. He was kind of approaching us slowly, and my coworker, I'll call her S, was a few steps ahead of me. YS tries to stop her, but I butt-in, automatically knowing that this man would be some sort of trouble. She stops as I stop to deal with him, but I shoot her a look of I'll-deal-with-it, so she keeps on doing what she was doing and walks off. 
When YS gets close enough to me, my encounter with him goes something like this:

YS: Hi, um............. can I uhhhh ask you a.............. question?

Me: (obviously aggravated but trying to hide it) Yes, what can I do for you?

YS: Well, come over here with me..... I'd like to show you something........

I don't normally follow male customers when they try to lead me somewhere, just because the only thing that us gas station employees fear more than a robbery is a kidnapping. Luckily though, this was not the case. Instead, YS leads me over to our roller-grills and shows me the tongs ""attached"" to them. I say ""attached"" like that because they are not actually attached, as you can take them off of this little metal loop to use them and people drop them all the time. Another thing about our tongs is that we clean them very vigorously every time they happen to fall, and we also have another clean set in a cabinet at all times to replace the old ones with every three hours. This is all relevant, don't worry.

YS: Why aren't these chained to the grill? 

Me: I don't know, would you like to discuss this question with a manager though? 

YS: Yes, if you would please. But.... uhm.... what's her name? (He says this as he looks up at our register, noticing that my other coworker is on the main register, so he assumes that it's her)

Me: HIS name is Justin, and I can get him for you really quick.

YS: Justin, huh? How long has she been working here?

Me: Uh, wha- uh well uh HE, JUSTIN, has been here for over 20 years. 

YS: Okay, well, yeah, get him for me, would you? Oh, and, also (he holds up some silverware in his hands- two forks and a spoon) where could I find a spoon?

I ignore that he's already holding a spoon and point out where he can find them, but then he suddenly realizes that he's holding one, and says, ""Oh, nevermind! I already have one!""

Great. So now I have to go into the freezer where my boss is trying to get inventory done as fast as possible before our next shipment comes in in less than three hours and tell him that there's a senile old man that would like to speak to him. About something completely idiotic. Which is exactly what I tell him, to which he replies, ""Oh great, this is exactly how I'd like to spend my night.""

After Justin comes out with me, we find YS guy, and he talks to him, and basically it just goes like this:

YS: Why aren't the tongs chained to the grills? What happens when they fall? I've seen other gas stations where the tongs are chained, why aren't yours?

Justin: Here in [state], it's not a health regulation or requirement that the tongs be chained to the grills, and this actually works out to our advantage as well as it's much more sanitary than having attached tongs as this makes us able to clean them every three hours as well as any time they appear to be unsanitary or if they've fallen onto the floor.

YS: Yes, but, why isn't it a health regulation? I mean, germs exist in [bordering state], why don't they exist here?

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Justin just repeats himself, then attempts to persuade YS to fill out a customer comment card, to which YS agrees to do, but then just keeps asking the same questions over and over again. To which Justin just responds with the same exact responses. This goes on for twenty. Fucking. Minutes. YS has now become a fire hazard as well since he's standing directly in front of the front doors and refuses to move despite Justin taking a few steps back in an attempt to get him to move. There are probably about 30 customers in the store at this point, and we're getting backed up on the register, and I'm afraid that something might go wrong with one of the newer employees that they may need Justin's help with. So I briskly grab a customer comment card and hand it to Justin just to try to make it clear that this guy is just a hopeless broken record and he needs to leave. 

Eventually YS leaves, and Justin looks so pissfully exhausted. He then tells me ""I thought that was never going to end.""

tl;dr what",The Perpetual Question,62
InspectorVII,11,12,1qxqo3,53,"Nothing flips the bitch switch faster than when a customer hears no and then breaks into the sob story.

Today I had an attempted return.  No receipt, discontinued product, in all probability something I haven't sold in quite a long time.  Let alone ""yesterday"" as the customer had claimed (I should mention at this point yesterday was Sunday, we are not open on Sunday).  As graciously as my little heart could bear I declined to do the refund on the long discontinued well used product.  However I did note that if she does happen to located the receipt our return policy does extend 90 days and I may be able to work something out with a valid receipt.  With that I am usually done, off to the next customer.  However, I would not be ranting hear if the customer accepted defeat and moved on with life.

His first argument was, ""I just bought this, it is defective"".  To which I reiterate, without valid recipient I unfortunately cannot refund you.

Second argument was "" You should guarantee things.  You are ripping off your customers""  To which I reply.  I absolutely do guarantee things, with valid receipt.

This argument ""I am in here all the time, you should remember me.  You should know I bought this.  How do you even do business if you don't know who your customers are?""  To which I reply that I see hundreds, possibly thousands of different faces every week.   

The final straw was that ""This is for my friend who is dying.  Do you know how hard it is to care for somebody who is dying? You are making this situation much worse.  Don't you have any empathy?  Don't you even care?  All you fucking care about is money.  You're nothing but a con artist""

Cue bitch mode.

I respond, at this point now shaking mad. ""Sir, we are done here.  Leave now.""

However this is an unacceptable solution.  He continues into a story about how much suffering his friend is enduring and how he doesn't have the money to replace defective items.   How I am a horrible person for not doling out freebies because somebody tells me a sad story.

Eventually after about 10 minutes of ignoring him he left, taking a business card on the way out.  My business card, the manager.   I look forward to that complaint.

I should elaborate the reason why this bothers me so much is because we all deal with our fair share of personal tragedy, it is difficult and unfortunate part of life.  It is also inevitable.   Some of us are entrenched in it.  Some of us are working past it.  Some of us are just starting the journey.   It is not that I don't want you to share.  It is not that I wont lend a sympathetic ear.  It is just when you use it as a trump card, and assume that I have no understanding of what this is like I become very offended.

Sc: Yeah?

Me: Well err, we don't deal with them because you're loan is with them

SC: Well can't you pay it off?

Me: Well no sir, because it's your loan. 

*Rinse and repeat* 

Like seriously, its like buying something on a credit card and going to the store and saying I want to pay off my credit card...GO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP CALLING YOU FOR THEIR MONEY!


**Second story, same day**

**Oh no it's your fault**

We have different depots that deal with different areas of the country, sometimes sales teams in H/O can change the default depot to something that might have it in stock, problem here is its on the other side of the country and you know can't travel through time and space - Every sales person knows (and it even tells the during the order process) to tell the customer delivery may be a few days later than their confirmation email since we have to get authorisation from a manager to ship it.

We get a call from H/O

Ho: Yeah err I have a customer on the line who was told he was getting delivery today and it hasn't arrived
me: Oh ok what's the details if you please

I check the order and nope, no one said nothing about delivery from our end

H/O: ""Well the customer is expecting it""
(I'm expecting to win the powerball but lookey here)

What's worse is the sales guy just kept saying the same thing, like literally ""Hes expecting it today"" no resolution, no ideas to the point I had to ask ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO""

He says he'll deal with it... 20 mins later we get a call, the customer called. I enter the details to see a note has been put on by our H/O that they told the customer to call us...Yeah thanks for that ass-socks now I get to explain the same thing all over again.

I explain to the customer he needed to wait for the auth from a manager before we could ship it out, he asked if he could cancel his order, I said unfortunately not.

Then. Karma. Came.

He paused and said ""Can I cancel it with them and take it with you?""

Usually we would say no, but I said ""Well if we were to do the order for you we wouldn't need the authorisation"" he replied with ""I demand you do it""

""Anything to keep the customer happy sir"" &lt;- at this point there was no suckyness from his part, he knew that there was a game that needed to be played and he knew that if this was brought to the big wigs he can say he demanded it and I just did what the customer wanted.

So we went ahead and did it, and I pocketed a nice commission (I can now afford a dessert at my hotel!!)

acelam,8,14,1qyego,48,"I'm fairly new to retail and used to think that some retail employees exaggerated how ignorant and/or rude their customers could be. However, these last two months have proven me wrong on every single level. The public is full of rude and downright strange people. Cue my story.

About a week ago, I was working on the sales floor. A lady walks in with her son who appears to be in his twenties. Immediately, the son asks where our restroom is located, which I didn't think was strange because it's very rare for men to be happy about being in the store I work.

Once I sent him on his way, his mother and I began talking about some dining room furniture. She tells me about how she found the ""same couch Oprah has"" on the side of the road and had it reupholstered, so she was looking for complimentary chairs. I internally rolled my eyes about the ""same couch as Oprah"" comment, but whatever. She seemed very eager to buy furniture and I don't give a damn what you tell me as long as you're ready to buy from me.

So after showing her some selections of dining chairs, I left her to peruse her options and went to help another customer who'd walked in while I'd been talking to her. On my way to the other customer, however, her son finds me and stops me, pointing to a rip in his shirt and saying, ""Hey, there's a nail sticking out in the men's restroom and I ripped my shirt on it. You need to have it removed.""

I apologized for the fact that he'd ripped his shirt and told him that I'd remove the nail as soon as possible. He left and I finished helping the second customer before returning back to him and his mother.

Instantly, before I could ask her how she liked our selection, she says, ""My son ripped his shirt on a nail in the men's restroom. Did he tell you about this?""

Again, I apologized and told her that I planned on removing the nail as soon as I was able. The store wasn't swamped, but there were only two associates on the sales floor and our manager was having to handle paperwork in the back. So neither of us could really disappear in case things did get busy or we had a customer ready to check out.

The lady replied, ""Well, is that *all* you're planning to do?"" I wasn't sure what more she wanted me to do, so I told her that I would make my manager aware of the problem and that I would immediately take the nail out of the wall instead of waiting.

I went to my manager's office and sort of hovered around, briefly explaining the issue at hand. My manager rolled her eyes and asked, ""Is she expecting us to pay for the shirt or what? All you can do is just get rid of the nail, if there even is one.""

So I grabbed the hammer and went to the men's restroom - sure enough, there was no nail, at least not one in a place where a person's shirt would get snagged. Our restrooms display clearance paintings/wall art that are hung up high and behind toilets, so unless the son was doing some climbing, there was *no way* he could've gotten his shirt hung up.

I sighed and returned back to the mother/son duo and asked the son where the nail was specifically, as I could not find a nail *anywhere* that he'd hang his shirt on.

He then backtracks and says, ""Well, uh, it wasn't exactly a nail. It was those silver hook things on the door.""

The ""silver hook things"" are the very blunt, very wide hooks used to hang purses/bags while a person uses the restroom. Given what the rip on his shirt looked like, there was absolutely *no way* the purse hanger would've caused that rip.

His mother again looks at me and says, ""So what are you going to do about his shirt? It's ripped because of your store.""

I apologized and told her that I couldn't take down the purse hangers. She looks like I've slapped her and says, ""Well, I don't care if you take them down or not. That's a Ralph Lauren shirt. It's a hundred and fifty dollars. I want to know what your store plans to do to pay for the shirt that you damaged. If I broke a candle, I'd have to pay for that!""

I wanted to tell her that maybe her son probably shouldn't wear expensive clothes while he was out shopping. I also wanted to tell her that our store actually doesn't have a ""you break it, you buy it"" policy (because if we did, all of us employees would never make a dime, lol). 

But I just calmly said again that there was nothing I could do and I was very sorry. Her face twisted up and she immediately turned around and stomped out, her son right behind her.

Afterward, my manager told me she figures it was probably a scam. As I didn't get a look at the shirt when the son came in, I had no idea if it was ripped before hand or not (though I highly suspect it was). Either way, my manager supposed that in another store, if this woman had continued to raise a stink, an overtired associate/manager may throw her a 10% discount to just shut her up.

So guys, beware of potential scammers as the holidays get here! Maybe this guy really did rip his shirt in our bathroom, but how in the world is that anyone's fault but his? Ridiculous no matter how you cut it.",It's my fault that you ripped your own shirt?,62
Stachahof,5,13,1r0j3k,45,"This is my first time posting here but I've been lurking for quite a while.  I work in a used media store that's privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part, I love it.  I get great discounts, I have plenty of regular customers who I like, and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no big-bad corporate to answer to.

Then there are the drawbacks.  Threats and cursing from customers who don't like their cash/trade offers and just overall rude people.  We also cater to low-income people because our prices are so low (the majority of our stock costs no more than $2.50) and while I don't want to generalize, a lot of them aren't the most desirable type of person.

This particular story happened about a month ago.  The couple in question is fairly regular, though I haven't seen much of them since this happened, but I've never liked them much.  They're usually pretty loud and dismissive.  

This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadn't worked.  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie.  No problem, my co-worker scanned their receipt and credited them $2.67 and they went to shopping.  

When they were finished, they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out.  As I took them, the man kept one and told me he didn't have to pay for that one because he'd brought another back.  We'll call him Dumb Fuck.

Me: No problem sir, I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer system.
DF: But I don't have to pay for it.
Me: You won't, sir.  I just need to scan it.

Reluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies.  I apply their discount and their total ends up being $10.68 for five movies.  The man pays and I think it's finished when he turns to his wife and says to her, not to me, ""She charged me for that movie.""

Immediately I'm irritated that he's talking about me as though I'm not there, but I bite my tongue and explain to him that he'd only paid for four movies.  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that I've over-charged him.  I pick up his movies, which I haven't bagged yet, and stack them on top of each other, adding the cost of them as I go.

""$2.67, $5.34, $8.01, $10.68, $13.35.""  Then I took off the top movie, the one he'd gotten for free, and set it aside.  ""$10.68.  You only paid for four movies, sir."" I smile.

DF: I can't believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refund.

I really have to fight back my anger at this point.

Me: Would you like me to go through the math again for you, sir?

A miracle, he finally addresses me.

DF: I don't need anyone to do math for me, I'm real good at math.

He complains for a couple more minutes, but eventually he takes his movies and leaves, still convinced that he overpaid for them.  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my co-worker to please watch the floor for a minute.  He couldn't stop laughing.","""She charged me!""",58
Sigillite,22,16,1r4dqa,46,"**Warning, language**

Posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qxrkh/so_long_and_thanks_for_well_nothing/) a couple of days ago about the lovely way the shitty co-owner of the restaurant I used to work at let me know that she was letting me go. but just not scheduling me! lovely. quick recap: I changed my availability for one shift, restaurant doesnt schedule me anymore, condescending owner wont return my calls. 

I called in today, two weeks after the fact, hoping to finally talk to her. Sure enough, she was there. I wish I had written it down so I could give you a more accurate transcript, but honestly, though most of it I was at a loss for words. FYI it is a small restaurant, with 2 bartenders and 2-3 servers on at one time taking 6-7 tables each. 

**Steph:** Thank you for holding this is Stephanie how can I help you?

**Me:** Hi Stephanie this is Dan

**S:** Hi Dan how's it going

**Me:** *thinking, seriously?* I was calling in to see why I wasnt scheduled the past two weeks, and why noone called me to tell me what was going on.

**S:** I wanted to talk to you about that, you see when you changed your availability we couldnt find any other shifts for you. You will have to switch with somebody to work three shifts a week.

**M:** What are you talking about, I opened up my availability when I said I couldnt work thursdays anymore. I am only trying to work three shifts a week, but I can do Monday through Friday nights, Friday and Saturday morning. How can you not find anything?

*At this point I'm not giving a fuck if I keep this job or not, I want this snide mother f-er to explain herself*

**S:** But people already have those shifts, I cant just switch them for you. Most of the other people are full time, so we do set schedules.

*We go back and forth for a while, with me trying to figure out A) Why she cant just schedule me, and move shifts around so that they can get coverage Sundays where they need it and have me fill the gap and B) Why it took her so long to tell me this*

**S:** So youre going to need to have somebody give up a shift so that you can get three a week.

**M:** Can you give me the numbers of the people that work those nights?

**S:** I can't do that, Maryland law won't let us

*BULL. SHIT. Every restaurant I've ever worked at has the numbers posted by the schedule*

**M:** Can you tell me who is working those days, or who is available Sundays?

**S:** No

**M:** So basically, what youre saying is that I have to drive all the way up there *20 minute drive* to talk to the two servers that are on, because I cant switch with a bartender, and talk to them while they're working to see if they would be able to switch with me? Hoping that they're actually available and amenable to working Sundays, and is actually able to discuss it and think about it during a shift.

**S:** Right

**M:**.......ok. *Fuck it* I also wanted to tell you that not trying to get in touch with me about this, neither calling me nor emailing me or even returning a phone call is extremely unprofessional. I've never had a boss do this, especially since you acted like nothing had happened when **I** called **YOU** just now.

**S:** Well the last time you worked I wanted to talk to you about it but you just ran out.

M: Because I was done, we just cash out to the bartender we dont need to talk to you guys. I left because I was finished, I didnt know you wanted to talk to me, why didnt you let me know before I left so that I would stay?

**S:** I was working on a catering order

**M:** Okay, so what, you expected me to just hang around on a saturday, past the time when I was scheduled to be done, when I had plans later that night, on the off chance that you may want to talk to me?? Come on....

**S:**.....Well I am really busy right now so you'll need to come up here and talk to me about this.

**M:** Ok fine, but again, not reaching out or even returning my calls was extremely unprofessional.

*while Im hanging up on her* 
**S:** Ok. Bye


I dont remember being hired as a manager, so no, I dont think that I am going to take care of the scheduling for you. If it was impossible to find one shift that you could change, out of five different days and 10-12 different people, than you just cant do your job. Sorry. There are so many awful business practices at that place they are only saved by the high quality of the wait staff, that she treats like shit, and their awesome food which the other owner is solely responsible for.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is boxes; Shall we begin?**

I’ve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery service.

My job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego. Occasionally, a box would show up that did not belong in my area. Sometimes, it’s because of a mistake farther down the line, or it could be a bad address (street does not belong in ZIP code), or it could be a major fuck-up caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me, when it did not.

This is about a major fuck up.

At the beginning of the shift, the unloaders (people who emptied out the massive silver trailers) and the “presorters” (people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts - one of which went to me), were under the impression that a large mail-order company was now in my area. It was not. But that didn’t stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my way.

When I would get a misrouted box, I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet (if it was small enough). If it was too large, or if the belt near my feel got backed up, the box had to go to one of six guys in my area. This pissed them off when it happened, because they had to touch something that did not belong to them. (technical note: this company is absolutely insane with logistics; they preach the art of touching something a few times as possible).

I did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible. So as the crap came in, I rotated the victim. Everyone except Badass-Ponytail was understanding.

Badass-Ponytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him. Over the course of the first two hours, I got called: asshole, faggot, fucker, mother fucker, pussy, pansy, goddamn piece of shit, mongoloid (surprised at this one, since it required knowing what it meant), blind, inbred, etc). Loudly.

The environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter. It was a dirty, shitty environment, and there was absolutely no decorum. This may have changed over the years, but in this era, there was zero censorship.

Permissive or not, personal or not, I had enough. It wasn't my fault, and there was zero I could do about it. So, I gave everyone else a break and started sending 100% of the misrouted load to Badass-Ponytail. I mean, if I’m going to get abused, I might as well give him a reason.

Box after box went to him. He very quickly got backed up, since he couldn’t handle is regular workload on top of the crap. His anger started boil. He was getting truly and sincerely angry. The verbal assault gained volume, and he started calling out for a supervisor. A supervisor did arrive, and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap. So he told Badass-Ponytail to stop being a baby.

At the hour three mark, he exploded. He began throwing boxes at me from about 15 feet away. I shut my belt down, turned around and played wide receiver. He threw, I caught, then stuck the box back on his belt. After a couple minutes of this, I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catch.

“You’re gonna die motherfucker!”

Badass-Ponytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me. He is both larger and stronger than I am, and I knew that if there was any actual violence, I would likely get thrashed. So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shield.

He charged into me, and I thrust the box into his chest, causing him to lose balance. Instead if hitting me, he had to right himself, or he’d fall about three feet onto a steel grate.

After stumbling, his mind cleared. “One more fucking misroute and I’m going to kill you after work.”

“Fuck you, you retarded piece of shit. You’re gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth. As for after work, just try. I’ll fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytail.”

Now, I said a lot of stuff working here. It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality. I mean, if I saw him waiting for me, I’d run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back. I hate fighting, and had managed to avoid it since middle school.

But it worked, and he backed down. “Look, hand the stuff out fairly and we’ll be cool. But you keep fucking with me and we’ll have a problem.”

I punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute, but went back to being “fair” again. No asses were kicked that day.

I sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise. Looking back, I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was. Everywhere else I’ve working in life, both of us would have been fired on the spot. And we would *deserve* it.

BlueRaith,7,9,1qyetu,47,"I work for a grocery company in the south. Company, not corporation so we don't have to bend quite so far to appease customers. No shareholders to answer to. :D

Anyway, we have a gas station at our location and the attendant is the person that gets to answer the phone. It's not usually that bad. This store is located in a small town and southern hospitality is still alive here for the most part. In fact, I've gotten a call where the customer APOLOGIZED for filing a complaint against another checker. I know, right?

Anyway, this customer was different. 

Me: Thank you for calling your-

Rude Old Guy: I want to talk to the lady that orders things on the computer! 

I was mildly irritated that he cut me off. But I guess people can be in a hurry sometimes. I also needed a bit more information as I had no idea who he was talking about. 

Me: :) Okay, but do you know the name of the person you wish to talk to? 

Because I am in the kiosk outside the actual store, I have to page people or departments over the intercom.

ROG: I just want to talk to the lady that orders things on the computer! 

Me: :| Do you know which department you're looking for? 

ROG: Just get me the lady that orders things on the computer! 

Me: :( Sir, there are multiple people who order things on the computer at this store. Do you know the item you're looking for? 

ROG: I want to talk to the lady that orders things on the computer!!!!

Me: &gt;:( I know, but each department orders their own stock and each department has multiple women that work it. Can you give me a little more information? 

ROG: NO! I WANT TO TALK TO THE LADY THAT ORDERS THINGS ON THE COMPUTER!

Jesus Christ. I have never wanted to hang up on someone so badly. This man was practically refusing to let me help him. So I did the next best thing and gave the call to one of my assistant managers. It wasn't until I went inside for my lunch that I found out what happened. 

K, who is a guy, ended up with him. He got the same exact run around that I did and tried to tell him that he was talking about multiple people as well. K sent the call to E, our MIC, who was the general merchandise manager as well. E is also a guy. 

E was also told that ROG wanted to, you guessed it, talk to the lady that orders things on the computer. E somehow was able to get ROG to tell him what the hell he actually wanted. 

ROG: I want the number for the Rotel company. I know y'all have that in your computers. 

E: Do you have the can?

ROG: Yeah.

E: That number is on the back.

ROG: No it's not! I want YOU to tell me the number! 

E: Sir, I see that can every single day. It's on the back, have a nice day.

PepperAnn90,5,9,1r4g87,43,"I am a sales leader in a boutique-style, Swedish-inspired children's clothing store. The area is pretty affluent and educated, so we don't get very many people who have lost all common sense. This is a short story of someone who might have.

I was the sole person on the floor with about 6 customers in my store. I was deep in the process of a return when a lady asked if she could hold something at the register. Being such a small store, I said yes, as we can generally keep track of whose pile of stuff is whose and check them out when they're done shopping.

A few minutes later, I've finished the return and processed a few other transactions when I realize the lady has left the store, and left her items on the cash wrap. No name, no phone number, nothing. Just left. Okay...well, I can hold this for a bit and see if she comes back, I suppose.

Three hours later, she hasn't returned and we sell her items. I warn my relief manager (RM) that this lady might come back in, but I'm not sure. Two hours after that, I leave for the day.

The next day, I come in for my closing shift. RM from the day before had opened, and filled me in on what happened after I left:

Lady comes back and says she has items held for her. Nobody can find them, because we don't have them anymore. The lady got pissy and said, ""Well, the girl with the short reddish-brown hair said she would hold them for me."" (I am the ONLY person who works in my store who matches that description.) Essentially, RM told her that we didn't have any more in stock in the right size, so they could order it or she could wait until another came in. Lady decides against the dress, but RM does so much ass-kissing that she still makes a $600 sale.

I'm trying to figure out how she thought I could hold the items for her with no name, no phone number, and no time she would be back for them. Hell, I've been to department stores that require a credit card number for a hold. SOMETHING. Like, I can't just hold it for ""Short Blonde Lady with Baby in a Sling"". That's a physical description of about 30% of our customers. Ugh.

Can't wait for Christmas...

ArQuesta,26,23,1r3xmk,43,"Hello again, fellow retail slaves. I've posted a few times before, but mostly about my time before college, when I worked at a Stop for Gamers. Not today. I meant to go get some reading done this evening, but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and I'm car-less at the moment, so I decided to tell you about a recent story.

I just got done with my Bachelor's this summer. I know, I should have escaped the abyss that is retail, but I'm stuck at home, saving up money to move to the D.C. area at the moment, while also filling out grad school applications, as well as working on big job applications. I'm in a stupid spot and I need money, so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a three-minute walk from home. Score.

For the most part the job is fine, no real horrible people to be found. The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping, so it's fine with me if they like being pricks. They just spent $6 on a f*cking drink. 

Anywho. Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness. I was working the drive-thru window, which, at night, meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot. During a rush there's two of us, as people's drinks go from normal to downright stupid-complicated. But, alas, there's always a button for it.

A nice, shiney $40k+ car pulls up, my last customer in a long line rush. She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chit-chat. Now, for some background, I have the worst baby face. I mean, it's great that I look young, but depending on the person my 28 years looks like 20. I don't wear make-up, drink, or smoke, so I am lacking any pre-wrinkles and I'm chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks. It's fine though, as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly. For this conversation I'll use BAC for the lady, and Me as me.

BAC: ""Oh, are you still in school right now?""

Me: ""Actually I just finished, I'm working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feet.""

BAC: ""Oh, what did you major in?""

Me: ""East-Asian studies."" *chuckles* ""It's kind of useless around here.""

BAC: ""Would you say that you could talk about your major confidently?""

Me: *at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college, or needs a strangely specific tutor* ""Oh, yeah, I can talk for days about culture, history, politics, language, etc for days.""

BAC: ""Have you ever read the bible?""


Me: *shitshitshitshit, here it comes* ""...Well, a bit when I was younger.""

BAC: *with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes* ""When I was in college, my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes, one where God existed and one where he doesn't. Sure, if you're in the box where he isn't there, fine, but what if you're in the other one? Is it really that harmful to believe?""


Now, at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers, and had tuned out the conversation, as she told me afterwards. I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me, but alas, I was trapped.


Me: *remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view, but deciding not to argue at work* ""Well, as a kid my dad let me try out every religion, and I've built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them. If I had to subscribe to anything--""

BAC: ""Some people are really fake, you know? They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area."" *suddenly angry* ""I know a lot of fake people, and they aren't people you should call friends.""

Me: *the fuk?*

This was the most annoying part...

BAC: *suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching* ""What are you going to do after you're done with school?""

Me: ""I dunno, work for the government?""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Take care of my parents and family.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Travel or work abroad.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""I've thought about adopting.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Live my life happily?""

BAC: ""What about after life?""

Me: ""There's nothing.""

BAC: *legitimately surprised* ""And you're okay with that?""

Me: ""Well, yeah, we're not immortal. You live to the best of your ability until you die.""

BAC: *changing tactics* ""When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson, really friendly, but it was fake. People are fake. Then I read the bible. There's something there, if you read it you'll understand.""

Me: ""Maybe one day I'll read it, but it's not--""

BAC: ""Well, you know, everyone has problems, right?""

Me: ""Of course.""

BAC: *surprised for some reason that I've agreed with her* ""Well, how do you deal with problems?""

Me: ""Sometimes slowly, sometimes not at all. I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people. You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again. Some people can't cope and need medications, but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their own.""

BAC: ""My husband used to be addicted to money, sex, and drugs.""


This is about where my patience absolutely ended, my face started to crack a grin. I'm not an arrogant person, but I write, I read, I study constantly. I'm an intelligent person, and I wasn't going to allow her to outwit or -speak me, but I was also trying to be unfailingly polite.

And then, like God himself saying ""Jesus lady, shut up"" the drive-thru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel, I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian, and turned away from the window. As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions. My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened. I was a little mortified. I mean, here was this lady with a car worth more than my four-year education, lecturing a girl (lol) who she thought was in the middle of college (~20), working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a, what she thought, excellent education. If she only worked retail, than dear drug-dealing hubby must have paid for that, right? At what point did she have the right to say that I wasn't spiritual? I'm very spiritual, and I have my own views of spirituality. At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs, money, and sex? Not only that, did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the non-religious simply because I told her I was educated? 


Plus she didn't tip that poor drive-thru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool. Seriously.

I used to work at a Greek and Lebanese restaurant as a busboy. I liked the job; good boss, easy job, chill coworkers. I was also the only white guy working there with an all Palestinian family. But one day my boss rushes in and demands that I start ""working the floor"" cuz of a ton of customers at once. My first table was a very VERY stereotypical traveling the country super tourist types. The conversation went a little like this. ""Hi, I'm your waiter for the evening, can I start you off with anything to drink?"" 
""Are you the oldest son?"" 
""No, sir, I'm just a white guy working here.""
""Oh, well how about the belly dancers? Do they still work here?"" (We never had belly dancers according to my boss)

Apparently, they really liked me and demanded that I wait their table, and my boss made me go back out there. However, after they had finished their meals, they left me about $60 for their meals that cost about $35 in total.

Mystic-Spiral,2,10,1qqiq6,43,"Disclaimer: on phone

So I'm sitting in the bath and this story comes back to me. The women's clothing store I work for has been doing a LOT of promotions lately. The store is routinely 30-50% off, and considering our already reasonable to moderately expensive prices, these are very good deals. I don't have to tell all of you that promotions make people a little more nutty than usual.

To start this off, for a good week we had run 50% off select items. The items chosen were some of the older styles that were clearly headed towards a markdown, but hey, why not try and get some money out of them? Alas, Sunday rolls around and a  new week starts thus prompting a promo change. Select 50% is over, however it goes to 40% off the entire store. 

The store obviously gets fairly busy during this. I'm incredibly efficient at registers so I go to ring, assign my best sellers to fitting room and floor, and my best taskers to keeping up with the slobs who destroy the place.  Of course ringing puts me in direct line of fire. 

You know what's coming next. 

A client approaches checkout with her stink face on and a huge stick up her ass. My retail senses go into over drive and I can already feel myself tensing up for the impending battle, whatever it may be. 

""Hi! How may I help you?""

Bug up her butt barely replies and proceeds to whip out a dress and a receipt. ""I need a price adjustment on this dress. I bought it full price and now it's on sale."" 

Okay, not too bad, maybe I was over anticipating. ""Sure, no problem! It's 40% off everything so I will credit the difference back to your card, super quick and easy!"" 

I swear to God the Earth shook. ""No! I want the 50% off that it was yesterday! I was busy and couldn't get to a store.""

Ah. There it is.

I put on my best face and fight on. ""Well unfortunately that promotion ended. I can't price adjust for past promotions, but it IS still 40% off today, so you are getting a great deal!""

""No. I want the 50% off that it was yesterday!""

""Ma'am, I can't do that. Corporate policy is that I can only price adjust for the current days promotions."" 

""Fine! But I'll be calling corporate! Give me their number!""

""Okay, the customer help line is 1-800-RETAILERSNAME""

""NO! I want your head office AND I want your district manager's phone number! Now!""

""Unfortunately we don't have the number for the head office and I am not allows to give out my DMs personal number. The 1-800 number will put you in touch with the person who can help you best."" 

""That's ridiculous! I can't believe you can't give me your district manager's number! They will be hearing about this too!""

""Okay ma'am. I do apologize, but my hands are tied by corporate policy.""

And this is my favorite part. 

""I don't believe you. You have more power than you are letting on! I'll take the 40% off and then I'll talk to your corporate about the other 10%!"" 

I do her transaction and hand her the receipts all while she still rants about how awful we are, about how I don't know how to do my job, and how she will get us all. 

""Alright, you are all set, remember the number is 1-800-RETAILERSNAME and just hold on to your receipts so they know the price adjustments we made today.""

She glowers at me and makes another passive aggressive remark about how it's stupid that I can't even give her my DM's name.

""Well you never asked for her name, just her number, which I can not give out. Have a nice afternoon! I can help whoever is next!""

Sasparillafizz,23,32,1r3ozm,41,"Not a great story, but was so ""Your joking, right?"" I felt I could post it so others could share in my bafflement.

Got a phone call earlier today at (Insert specialty gaming store here.) 

Our phone call customer, we'll use PG for Phone guy, called regarding his Xbox1 reserve.

Now, for the pre-orders for the console, we took a down payment as a deposit for the console to make sure you are actually going to pick it up. Otherwise everyone and their grandma would try to 'reserve' on of the new consoles and only a fraction of them would have the money/time/etc to pick it up at launch. These deposits are of course fully refundable if you change your mind. Or if you go buy it from a competitor, ebay, etc. 

Reserved items are held for 48 hours, we will absolutely guarantee it remain in stock that long for you if you preorder. We aren't going to hold it a week, a month, or longer; sitting around collecting dust and shooing away customers who want to purchase the item you can't be bothered to pick up because you put down a 20% deposit months ago. This is ESPECIALLY true with systems and collectors sets, which we hold VERY FIRMLY to the 48 hour rule.

Onto the story!

PG: ""I had a question about the Xbox 1 I had reserved.""

Sasparilla: ""Go ahead?""

PG: ""Well see, I have a bit of a family emergency, and won't be able to pick up the Xbox until tuesday and-""

At this point I cut him off, having done this conversation so. many. times. this day alone; let alone the last week. ""Regretfully sir, the consoles can only be held till 6pm on Saturday. If you don't pick it up Saturday night, it will go on sale on sunday to the first buyer.""

PG is PISSED. ""What do you mean you'll sell it? I paid for it!""

Sasparilla: ""You placed a deposit on the item in question to have it set aside for you. If you do not pick it up within the hold period, we cannot guarantee we will have it in stock when you come to pick it up.""

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!""

Sasparilla: ""How so?""

PG: ""Your supposed to hold it 48 hours! It comes out friday.""

Ah, I see the problem. Not the original problem addressed, but the bone he is currently chewing on. ""We are starting the pre-ring process at 6PM on Thursday. The consoles will be paid for and purchased, but they won't be handed over the counter until midnight. Its to preven-"" 

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!"" 

Ah. A street savvy lawyer here. Sasparilla: ""We can, and are, Sir. We can ring up the products early, the steet date only prevents us from handing the product to customers early to get an advantage over competitors. No matter where you go, you will not get your hands on a Xbox one before midnight. But we can make the purchase any time we please.

PG: ""You can't do that!""

Sasparilla: ""We can, and are sir. Microsoft has never had a problem with us doing this for any of their products in the past. Since the items are being sold at 6PM Thurs, you have 48 hours to pick it up."" 

PG: ""Well I cant get there till Tues."" 

Sasparilla: ""Then your console will be sold on Saturday after six. You ca-""

PG: ""You can't do that! We had a CONTRACT.""

Note to any armchair lawyers, we do not. A deposit is not a purchase of the product, merely that he has offered the payment ahead of the time of exchange. The terms of this are clearly spelled out, and his offer is refundable at any time if an agreement (payment at price at time of purchase) is not made.  

Sasparilla: ""Sir, our terms are very clearly explained. If you do not show up for your purchase it will be sold. There is very high demand for the Xbox 1, we cannot hold it for you till Tues. At best, I can hold it to the end of saturday night.""

PG: ""You said you have to hold it 48 hours!""

Sasparilla: ""We are. From opening Friday, to closing saturday."" 

PG: ""Thats not 48 hours!""

...

Your kidding right? Your killing me here.

Sasparilla: ""From open to close Friday. And open to close saturday. Each day is 24 hours apart. This adds up to 48 hours. We can hold your console till then.""

PG: ""Well I can't make it till tues!""

Sasparilla (silently) /to f-ing bad?/

Sasparilla: ""Do you have someone who could pick it up for you?""

PG: ""I dunno, my friend could."" 

Sasparilla: ""If you pay for the console in full and provide him with the receipt, he can come in before Sat and pick up your console for you. I'll even make a note on the account that another person will pick it up for you with the receipt.""

PG: ""Fine. You better have my damn console for me. I gotta go visit my aunt in the hospital! I shouldn't be punished for this!""

Sasparilla: ""As long as your here before saturday at closing.""

Seriously. The launch release of one of the most sought after electronics a week before thanksgiving...and you think we are going to HOLD it for you?

verynotberry,14,6,1r0rm7,41,"I've been out of retail for several years, but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia.  I worked in a store in a smaller town, where you aren't always slammed and get to know your customers.  There was one family I'll always remember with fondness.  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it. I looked forward to their visits. These were truly kind, wonderful people.

However, there were also the jerks.  The guy I'm going to tell you about is one of those.  Now, normally when someone would be a jerk to me, I would tend to write it off.  It's not personal, I'm not verynotberry, I'm the cashier.  If it happened every time they came in to the store, that was another story.  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers.  Talked down to us, treated us like idiots, the lot.  But one day, one glorious day, I got my petty revenge.

He came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases.  While counting the change, I noticed a Canadian penny.  This store was in the U.S.  So . . . not legal tender.  I tell coin man, CM, for short that I can't accept his penny.

CM:  What?  Why not?

Me:  Well, it's not legal tender.  

CM:  Why not? 

Me:  Well, this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada, so I cannot accept this.

&lt;bear in mind, I'm smiling and as friendly as I could possibly be&gt;

CM:  What?  That's bull----.  Just take the d--n penny!   (Truly, he was a gifted debater.)

Me:  Well, sir, I would, but outside the boundaries of Canada, this is not legal tender, so I cannot accept this.

CM:  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE!  

&lt;Because I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins, don't you?&gt;

Me:  Sir, if that is true, I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them, but as it stands, I will need an American penny.

(It's important to note that throughout this entire process, he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars' worth of coins.)

CM:  Oh Jesus.  Fine.

He throws a penny on the counter.  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest, kindest, most customer-friendly smile.

Me:  Thank you so much, sir.  Please have a nice day.

Now, if this had been any of our other customers, I would have taken the penny no questions asked because, hey, the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly, so it's easy to miss.  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny, but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel small.

It felt amazing!

So 3 ladies come in for dinner, I seat them give them the menu's, amuse bouche etc. A little while later I come back for their drink orders. One lady picks up the menu, looks at the wine list and loudly exclaims :

""13 dollars for one glass of wine!? Who would pay 13 dollars for one glass of wine?!""

Me: ""Well I don't set the prices I'm sorry""

Lady: ""Well no I guess you dont. Well thats the cheapest on the menu so I guess ill have to have one of them then""

When they come up to pay, the same lady notices a difference in the computers charging and the price list, but not untill after she had paid her portion:

In my time spent there I've seen my share of sticky fingers -- usually belonging to the younger crowd and going no further than a gourmet caramel or two, which is why this lady was particularly memorable. She was easily in her late sixties, short and rotund, and entirely inconspicuous... until I saw the wiggle.

Part of my job is to make the rounds on the floor to make sure everything is running smoothly. I spot the lady in question with a miniature Monet calendar in hand. It's slightly larger than a piece of toast. I make a mental note and move further down my route, when I see her dart furtively into a corner of the store. At this point I've gone partly up our short staircase, and have an aerial view of her moving strangely in front of the wall. When she turns around again, the calendar is gone.

We hold a strict policy of not apprehending shoplifters in our store, which has always been so frustrating, but I usually find little ways around it. I approached the woman, who now had a visible rectangle protruding from the front of her trousers. With the most negligent glance in that area, I smiled brightly and asked ""Would you like a basket for that?""

She blanched, and stammering out a negative, brushed by me like the calendar had caught fire. I had done what I could. I maintained my distance but kept a keen eye on her while she pretended to browse for a few minutes before hurrying out the door.

Ever since I was younger I always wanted to work at this theme park here in Florida, I mean I always thought it would be so cool, so when the acceptance into working for this company came I jumped on it. I've been here since May and when I thought I would be working in a kitchen or something related to my major of Culinary Arts, I was wrong. 

I currently work at one of those Popcorn and Ice cream wagons you typically see in theme parks and normally I can get through a day just because I love the people I work WITH. This is not the case of last Monday.

(technically this is retail related cause I do sell some merchandise things)

Mondays shift was from 5:45pm to 12:15am so overall not too bad. I was put at a cart that most wagons close With or Around Park closing time so I was pretty confident that I wasn't closing anything (Closing is a bitch to do when you have closed 90 percent of every week that you work, especially popcorn wagons) I get in and see my name on the closing list as closing Popcorn 1, at this point my heart sinks because that means I wont be getting out of here till at least 1am. 

The day goes by alright, until about 10:00pm (wagon closes at 10:30 for some weird reason when park is open till 12)
Here are a few minor things that just built up

* People decided that it was okay to throw money at me when paying for something
* When I ask how someones day is at least say okay or good don't ignore that I asked and just start with your order, believe it or not I do care how your day is going
* A guy came up and cut my line during the middle of a transaction with another guest and asks what happens if he dropped his frozen lemonade, well normally we would just give him a new one but since I had a hunch he was straight up lying to me I asked some questions; such as Where he dropped it (he wasn't too sure where they were) and how long ago he bought it and where (like 20 minutes ago and from this cart but not from me; huh thats funny I've been here the WHOLE DAY no break for me yet) and he said he ""thinks that their were three that dropped on the ground"" I told him without the carton or lid or some proof I could not just replace 3 free lemonades. 

(Note: I didn't even call the managers because I knew that they would just give in and give him the 3 free, I really didn't care at that point though)

And the grand prize of my shitty night ended at 10 minutes before closing. This lady comes up too my wagon and wants to buy two 12 dollar popcorn souvenir buckets so I go and grab them and start to fill them while she fishes out her card (more efficient this way, not practical I know) 

So I come back after filling these buckets and she's trying to pay with this feature that the theme park has for resort guests that is on their wrists. well it wasn't accepting her pin so I asked for her back-up which is an actual card that  they are given at check in and told to keep with them at all times because they are still beta testing the wristbands. she is all annoyed because apparently our 3 button wasn't working to enter her pin with (funny been working all day lady!) and so her husband decides he's just going to pay cash and I tell him the total. 

In the middle of me saying your total is 24 dollars the woman interrupts with ""you do have bags for these right?"" (No we don't we are a popcorn stand, we do provide handles for you to carry them with and they have lids) I tell her ""no unfortunately we don't but if you turn around and go to them they do""(literally its maybe 5 steps away there is a cart that sells merchandise stuff that has bags)  In the middle of that statement the crazy old bitch says ""are you fucking kidding me"" I just stare at her at this point she keeps rambling on about how ""fucking pissed she is that I don't have any fucking bags"" and that since I don't have any bags she will not be buying them, knocks one of them on the ground and walks away.

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

Shout out to /r/JealousyGrey and his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r24y4/they_do_know_theyre_fake_right/) that reminded me of this gem...

The worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves. I worked in a much smaller store than most, the shelves were only about 20 feet away from the door. At any given time, there would be $50,000 to $100,000 worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had. Everything ranging from the full version of design software, productivity software, portable hard drives, headphones, etc. Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe. Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard. Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate (like a grocery store) so we were required to put products where they told us to put them. For example, when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space, we'd have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display. It was madness. Over the years though, they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took over..

The worst for us was a video editing program. It cost $1,299 and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets, but it also made it way easier to grab and run with. Anyway, a box of that would go missing *every week!* It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell! We'd look over, notice it was missing, ask everyone working, usually only 5 or 6 of us including one technician and one manager (it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once) anyway, we'd ask everyone if they sold it, and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it. We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf instead.

So, life goes on and time passes. The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again. Meanwhile, a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up. One time, I was playing billiards in their garage and there's this one guy who was there because he was a [kleptomaniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store... I couldn't believe it. I was playing pool with the guy that stole about $20,000 worth of software. He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair. People almost got fired for that shit! It was crazy. I wanted to punch the guy in the face!

Oh well, he did go to jail for a couple years and [I whooped his butt at pool](http://i.imgur.com/QqHzZ.gif). He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things. Looking back at it now, it obviously didn't effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gear.

**TL;DR**: Someone stole a *lot* of software from the store. I met him years later and beat him... at playing pool.

I have *soooo* many other stories from working that store for so long, I'll tell you guys some more later. For now I'll just wish you a safe holiday season, stay strong, and eat a breakfast.

All the best,

partinobodycular,14,6,1r701h,34,"I'm an assistant manager at a shoe store with a free rewards program. You get 10 points for every dollar you spend, and every 1500 points gets you a $10 off certificate. One of my associates, A, had just signed up a customer who was leaving the country the next day and I guess wanted to take shoes for everyone back home. The customer ended up spending about $800. Normally, the points are added to the account when we close the registers at the end of the day, and it can take a couple of weeks to actually see your certificate. But since this girl was leaving, I did some quick math and gave her $50 off. After she left, I pulled A aside to show her how to fill out a points adjustment form so we could email customer service and say, ""Hey, we already honored a bunch of these points, so you can deduct them."" A is fairly new - I think she started in September? She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now. Most of the time.

Part of the form is to explain how many points need to be added/deducted, and why, so I asked out loud how many points would get you $50 off. I could have figured it out in my head, but hey, ~~this was a teaching moment~~ I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldn't have to. Turns out, she didn't know how many points it takes to get a certificate. Okay... this is kind of Rewards 101. I ask a few more questions to see what she *does* know. Turns out, she also doesn't know details about how points are earned. This is really basic stuff. Any customer could ask her these questions at any time. So I give her a quick rundown, and then toss an easy one her way.

""How many dollars do you have to spend to get 1500 points?"" She doesn't know. I'm getting frustrated, so I grab some paper and write it down, thinking that'll help her see how simple it is. 10 points per dollar, how many dollars for 1500 points? All you have to do is divide 1500 by 10, but A can't do it. She's starting to get a blank look, and I realize I need to back off; I believe she has the capability to solve this question, but she's shutting down. I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know, and let her go.

A few minutes later, it's time for A's fifteen, so I look around to see where she's gone to. I don't see her on the floor. I'm starting to get a bad feeling. I ask her friend, C, if she knows where A is, and C says she's in the bathroom. Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature. I started worrying that I had been too harsh, and that A was now crying in the bathroom. I'd never made an associate cry before. I watch for A to come back out onto the floor, and the longer I wait, the worse I'm feeling. Finally I see her come out, and she looks composed. I wait a minute to give her some space - I don't want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out - and then head over to see if she's okay and tell her to go on her fifteen. She says she's already gone, so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down. Fair enough, though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break. She mentions that she felt too much pressure, and then says that B, the main cashier, had laughed at her. This is kind of unsurprising, B is one of our biggest troublemakers. I have plenty of other stories to tell about B, but I'll save them for another night.

**TL;DR** Made an associate feel stupid. To be fair, she was being stupid.",Basic skills are hard to grasp,40
Lightfairy,4,6,1r445p,31,"Been posting a few stories. You can find them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=author%3ALightfairy&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Many many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier. This supermarket was in a large shopping centre. Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was 33 years ago. Wow! Time has flown! 

This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt. Bomb threats had been made to various stores. We, the staff, thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work. The alarm would go off, we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time, we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again. 

We were having a bomb scare every couple of days. All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened. 

Then, in the space of nine days three stores were bombed. The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve. The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest. 

Cue this story. Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert. A lady comes up to my check out. Two carts of frozen goods. Chickens, 4 litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine. I start putting the order through. Keep in mind this was back in the dim, dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from. No scanners back then. I was slaving away, making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off. 

By this time we all knew the drill precisely. Pull the cash draw, throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately. We did not muck around any more! So, with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit, I pull the draw and prepare to exit. 

'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?' I hear screamed at me. My customer with all the frozen goods. 

I turn to her and say 'Would you please exit the store immediately. It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent events.'

She is having none of it. 'What about all my food. Only part of it is rung up and I need it. You have to finish my order. It will only take 5 or 10 minutes.'

With thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say, 'Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta here!!'

Thankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time. I jump on the train and head 1. 5 hours west. Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home (it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked) as they were having a bomb scare as well!! Total of two bomb scares in one day for me!

I heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store. As for that ladies '5 or 10 minutes'? They received only a 10 minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve. They managed to evacuate over 2000 people before it went off. No one got hurt. They have never charged anyone over the event. I left the job shortly after. This kind of ruined my taste for working check out. 

TL;DR Ice cream and bombs don't go together. Just ask my customer.

JSaltsea,13,10,1qycfn,31,"This time from customer side, I was leaving the meat market, chatting with the guy who was going out to gather the dozen of carts in the parking lot. This lady is just ahead of me with her cart. Tosses everything in her car and just leaves it there, about 10 inches from my car (on a windy day at that.)

Me: "" WOW! That's going to leave a nice DENT in my car!""

The lady turned purple in shame and quickly pointed out that ""The cart-boy was going to get it anyway.""

Me: "" The cart-boy's name is Jose and he's not paid enough to cover the dent YOU""RE going to leave in my car.""

Somehow, I'm still clueless how/why, she grabbed her cart and literally ran away from me, stashed it in the cart corral and waited for me to take off. Weird, Weird, Weird.",This one goes out to the cart people,41
denrae-,7,8,1qyazy,31,"The other day, while working at my local grocery store, an older woman came through my check out line. She was using a walker and had a VERY severe hunch back. Her head was actually lower than my register it was so bad. 
I was just finishing up with bagging the items for the customer in front of her. The lady directly behind the woman says to her 'Here sweetie, let me help you put your things on the counter!' (She had her items in bags tied to the sides of her walker.) the woman turns and yells at this friendly lady, and tells her NOT to touch her items because that is HER (meaning me) job. I could tell that she was going to be very difficult after that, so I proceeded with extreme caution/friendliness. I started ringing her items and asked her how she was doing. She then starts mumbling to herself and yells, 'Well I guess I'll dig out my store card since you didn't ask for it and obviously WERENT GOING TO because you don't care.' 
I apologized to her for not asking before I started her order, and as I was waiting for her to find it I bagged her items up with paper inside of plastic, exactly like she yelled at me to do. 
My manager, who is almost sickeningly sweet on an every day basis, could see the woman was being difficult, so she came over to ask the woman if she needed help paying or getting out to the car. The woman started mumbling to herself about how I shoved all her items into one bag ( there were three bags with maybe four items in each, because I figured she couldn't lift much ) and how she doesn't even know what I did with all her stuff (it was sitting on the counter...). 
My manager helped her slide her card through the card reader, helped her read the screen, pushed the buttons for her etc, all while being talked down to by this woman. She then demanded my manager get her a cart by yelling 'I NEED a CART' about four or five times. 
My manager just kept saying 'Okay sweetie. I'll help you.' and goes to get her a cart. She puts the woman's items into the cart and goes to help her to her car when the woman just starts yelling 'STOP just STOP HERE' and leaves... 

And then today a customer came through my line with a gift bag. I don't think she spoke English very well. She handed me the bag and just said 'For you.' It was a hand knitted or crocheted (not sure which) red and green hat. I didn't know her. She just gave me a homemade gift just because. It's the sweetest thing a stranger has ever done, especially while at work. I really almost cried cause it was just so unexpected. I will never forget that moment. 

I deal with a lot of jerks because I work in customer service. I bite my tongue on a daily basis. People ignore me, treat me like I'm an idiot, and belittle me because they think I'm lower class than they are. I get judged constantly, and sometimes I just want to scream in a customers face 'YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ME. I WORK MY ASS OFF EVERY DAY. I WORK SO SO HARD TO IMPROVE MY LIFE. I STARTED FROM NOTHING AND I DID ALL OF THIS ON MY OWN. IVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE HERE IN A YEAR THAN MOST HAVE IN 5.' But I never do.
For that woman to go out of her way like that just to say thank you, thank you for being here to wait on me, means so much. When I hear comments like 'You work so hard!' Or 'You do everything here! Do you ever go home?' it gets me through those difficult customers. 

Sorry if I seem overly emotional about it, but having something so infuriating happen then be followed by something so heartwarming gets my emotions all pumped up. ",Some people are just so nasty...,39
ShadowReeves,9,9,1qz3ri,32,"Diving straight into my historical preamble; i was at the time working in a huge hobby store, high volume retail and wholesale, and like anywhere, xmas was pretty nuts. What i had never considered while looking for a job in retail was ever working with children, occasionally you get that desperate parent who wants to use the staff toilets before the child explodes, but when a customer comes up to you and says 
""im sorry but my son has had an accident on the floor"" my first response is to think, *""why are you apologizing for a possible law suit?""*  but it quickly became apparent that the child in question, who looked well old enough to have mastered the concept of a toilet, had shat on our children's section floor. 

if 10 was a well solid, high protein, wipeless shit, this was about a 2. and it was EVERYWHERE. it looked like explosive diarrhea with an extra cup of water mixed in just to make sure it spread to the corners and under the shelves. the mother was a little red in the face from embarrasment and explained, ""he was just so excited being in the store he didn't want to leave, even for the bathroom"" 

""oh yeah"" says i, ""we get that a lot"". my sarcasm was palpable. 

as a mere underling in the retail world i didnt have anyone to palm the job off to, but as the floor manager was elsewhere i also couldn't plead the classic ""ive never had a child attempt lift-off via anal propulsion before, i dont know what to do"" line. 

having no wish to clean the mess, i (and still with no regret) handed the mother a roll of paper towel and made eye contact 

""oh you want me t...well i gues..yeah i suppose it isn't your job."" 

""yeah, im going to find a mop""

i proceeded to lean on a mop handle and watch the mother clean up the shit, or rather soak it up, (i didnt want to get the mop dirty) then i cleaned the floor with disinfectant.  

- i don't think they bought anything. 

TL;DR: a kid explodes on the floor and the mother cleans the mess. ",a bit of a shitty story.,41
Coolio23,16,13,1qqa7s,31,"I had quite the morning today. This is a long story, no apologies. TL;DR is at the bottom.

Last Wednesday night I was browsing the Craigslist ads for part-time work because I've been hurting for a job for quite a while now. I came across one for a big sporting goods store near my area, so I sent in my application and went to bed. Having done this countless times and never gotten an interview, I didn't think much of it.

The next morning, as I put on my pants to get ready for classes, my phone rang on the bedside table. Lo and behold, it's the sports store! The woman introduced herself and says that they'd like an interview. Hell yeah! She told me to be at the store at 7:10 AM, and to just ask for a manager when I get there. I thought to myself *""Okay, that works perfectly for the class times I have tomorrow.""* I agreed and hung up, excited. They had called barely 12 hours after I sent in the application! They must really need someone, I thought.

Now, this was going to be my second ever job interview. So I prepared myself, prepping responses to interview questions, getting a folder for a hard copy of my resume, references, and any questions that I would have for the interviewer. Psyching myself up, I set my alarm early and went to bed.

Friday morning came (yes, *today*), and I got dressed: slacks, a tucked in button down, and some nice shoes. I rolled out of my driveway and headed to the store. 

It was 6:30 AM when I left, and dark. While I've driven this route before (the store is next to a mall that I shop at occasionally), I've never gone through it this early. As a result, I got held up by school buses, which in retrospect I should've thought of since it was a residential area. I silently raged at the high schoolers as they boarded the bright yellow bane of my existence. Regardless, I got to the general area of the store with 10 minutes to spare.

And I made a wrong turn.

My navigational skills aren't the best in the dark. The wrong turn sent me *way off course*. After calling the store's phone number and letting them know I'll be late, I asked for directions and the woman kindly obliged. I thanked her profusely and hung up. 

I arrived at the store at 7:20. The gates were up and the doors were locked, so I caught the attention of a passing-by employee, who directs me to ring the doorbell, literally. I did so, standing in a puddle of my own worry because I was ten minutes late for a job interview I really need. 

The guy came back and motioned for me to ring it a second time, then left again.

He came back a third time and held up nine fingers, saying something that I couldn't make out because of the soundproof glass between us. He left again, this time returning with a woman who I assume is a manager. She rolled up the cage and unlocked the doors.

&gt; Her: Hi, can I help you?

&gt; Me: Yes, I'm Coolio23. I'm here for a job interview.

&gt; Her: Oh, you're the person from the phone? 

&gt; Me: Yes ma'am.

&gt; Her: Oh, I was wondering why you called so early. Well, I'm not allowed to let you in before store hours.

&gt; Me: But, I was told to be here at 7:10.

&gt; Her: Well I can't let you in right now, can you come back at 9?

&gt; Me: Um, no, I have classes during the morning that don't end till the afternoon...

&gt; Her: Can you come back at like 12 or 1?

&gt; Me: Uh, sure. 1 o' clock is fine.

&gt; Her: Okay, thank you.

I walked back to my car and head home, wondering if I've ruined my chances or made myself stand out by arriving two hours early. I went to class, got some lunch at home, then returned to the store at 1 PM. I walked in and got the attention of a big guy in a store uniform, saying I'm there for an interview. He walked over to the register and asked the woman from earlier if she wanted to do the interview and she said ""No"". The guy shrugged and motioned me to follow him to the back. He seemed like a pretty cool guy (he wasn't frowning or angry), which put me at ease.

I sat down in his office and he walked in with my application. He asked me why I applied here, what my previous jobs entailed, where I was going to school. He said that he liked my hours of availability (Fridays and weekends), and how I had no retail experience (*""We'll teach you the way we teach things.""*). He said that he'll run this by his boss and that I'll probably get a call.

That was it. The whole interview was over in *six minutes*.

I was caught completely off guard by how short it was, so much so that I didn't ask any of my questions or anything else that I had prepared for. I shook the guy's hand and went on my way. I'm still not completely sure if I got the job or not.

LadyGrizabella,4,7,1qx6p0,32,"At the school where I volunteer, in addition to having grades K-5, we also have several preK classes, one of which is bilingual.

Teacher: You can try but she doesn't talk much to anybody.

So I grab my clipboard and paper so we can make a list of books she wants. I know this particular class is bilingual and since I speak a tiny bit of Spanish, I decide to try that first.

Me: Hola. Me llama Senora (lastname). Como te llama?

Very softly, almost to the point I can't hear her, she tells me her name.

Me: Bien. Que es libro, (name)? Which book do you want?

She points one out and I start to write down the title.

Her: Es pato! Es pato quack quack quack!

Me: Si! Pato quack quack quack!

Me: Si! Muy bien!

Shortly after the bilingual class left, we got a second class of preKs. We managed to get all their wishlists written down and the majority of them were sitting in line on the carpet while they waited for the last two or three to finish up.

Hello. This is my third post in Tales From Retail. It's more of a moany whinge than my others, but I enjoyed writing it, and hope you enjoy reading it. Here is the [blog](http://anthropologyandbooks.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/stubborn-petty-and-childish/) entry, by the way.
Here you go:



This morning I was cheerfully buttering my toast when I promptly dropped it into the cutlery drawer, butter side down.

This didn’t upset me in the least, and after I’d checked the toast for cutlery drawer grime and cutlery drawer hairs, I thought to myself
‘Haha! I am easy going and calm.
That is very cool.
I am both unfazed, and cool’

I was very pleased with myself. So pleased that I was still thinking about it this afternoon.
But then I thought about how I am at work, and the little things that annoy me. Tiny things give me no amount of rage. I mostly get annoyed at customers, for ridiculous things.

So I have decided to make a list of these things.

By the way, I know they are ridiculous. I know they are insignificant and unworthy of my attention, but after this long in retail, sometimes I can’t help myself. Often I become petty and unreasonable, and I amfully aware  that I am being petty and unreasonable, but I cannot stop myself. The small sense of satisfaction I get from these actions is childish, and stubborn, and utterly worth it.


**1: Not saying hello.**

Why? Why do you do this? I mean, I know we aren’t buddies. I’m not asking for your number. I won’t follow you home and ask for some tea.

We are both human people. I am a human person. I don’t exist just to serve you. I like to be acknowledged as a human person. Just say “Hello” (But don’t go too far. This is Britain. When you ask how I am, I get confused and slightly offended).

If this happens, sometimes I wait for the customer to say hello, but I don’t have the staying power a lot of the time. It gets too awkward too quickly for me. So I will go slowly. I will take my sweet, sweet time.

And then I give you the most change I can without it becoming obvious. I also find the dirtiest pennies I can. I will also not offer to give you a special stampy on your stamp card.

And then I will say “Thank you!” loudly and cheerfully, and perhaps even wave as you leave.

Hee! You lose!


**2: Customers putting money on the counter.**

What’s wrong with my hand? Am I dirty? Am I going too slowly for you? If this is the case, then you are making me take more time, because I now have to pick up your money, count it (if it’s change), and then put it in the till. I will also do this at a slower pace, because hahaha, that makes me the winner.

I will put your change on the counter, too. Because that will definitely teach you a jolly good lesson, and you’ll never do it again.

 **3: Asking for something before I can offer it e.g. “Can I have a bag/receipt/a stamp on my special stampy card?”**

I will offer you these things, because that is my job (unless you are being rude).
The only reaction I have to this is to become cheerily sarcastic e.g “It’s £5 per bag/If you say please!”

Ho ho. I win.

**4: “Can you look up a book for me?”**
No. Really, I have no way of looking up a book for you. This computer I am standing behind does not have the capacity to look up a book.

Also, I can’t type.

Sometimes, if they look like they have a sense of humour, I will say “No” to them and pull a funny face. Let’s all have a laugh, while I teach you a lesson, and then win.

**5: Customers who take the receipt from the printer.**

You win. You idiot. Unless the Gods are smiling down upon me, and you walk away without your change/book/saying thank you.

Then I can call after you, and give you a smug face. You idiot.

**6: Giving me a reason as to why you need a bag.**

I do kind of prompt this, because I always ask “Do you need a bag?” so I think a lot of people feel like they need to justify why they need a bag.

Is it a gift? That’s nice. Is it raining outside? Oh, my! You want to keep the book nice? Well done you!

I don’t care.

Just say yes.

*I don’t care.* 

Also, it isn’t my fault that we don’t have paper bags. I do not spend my time out the back constructing our bags from recycled materials. It is not my decision what kind of bags we offer you. When you tut at me for not having a paper bag, it makes me want to put one of our plastic bags over my head and secure it with a rubber band until you walk away. 
Without a bag.


That’s my list of unreasonable things that annoy me. Of course there are reasonable things that annoy me, but I don’t think I’d enjoy writing about them as much.


I would like to thank a few of my colleagues for reminding me about items to include in this list. The rage it brought me whilst we were discussing it was worth it.

No, really.","Stubborn, Petty and Childish.",58

Toni-Cipriani,9,4,1r6mbw,27,"This isn't so much a tale as it is something I've been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent 

I work for a small independent corner/liquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the area.

I have worked for retail chains too, namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain.  

Some pros I've been noticing are that working for an independent store:

-Much more laid back on certain things, have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please. Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have ""tabs"" when they are short on money

-Smaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful. 

-I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond, but it's more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers. Don't have to worry about things like returns, etc

-I  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop. 

-I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeks.


A few cons I've picked up on:




-The owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every 2 days pretty much

-No benefits like health coverage or anything

-No holidays off, only 4 people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stone.

-Realistically speaking I probably have alot less job security,  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel I'm well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly. 

My work doesn't have things like ""write ups"" it's what the owner wants at the end of the day. 

-This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop, but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have. I'd probably have to either ignore it or leave, people close to the owner are essentially untouchable I'd imagine.

 Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope. ",Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain?,31
RoseTheChief,19,8,1r3jg5,27,"The customers were one thing, but some of the employees were just unbelievable. From drug addicts to prostitutes and crazy felons, it was never a dull day at work. Eventually they stopped hiring felons after they hired someone fresh out of county jail and she tried to unionize the store &amp; start riots against the managers.
There were a few winners that stick out in my mind from the 3 years I was  there while in high school &amp; college.
One lady was a dominatrix/ordained minister &amp; she hung up clothes at a thrift store. She always hit on the younger guys...like high school/college kids that worked there and that were customers. She was in her 40s, and looked like she had a lot of bad botox done to her face. She would have days where she would be depressed &amp; one of my friends tried to make her feel better &amp; she yelled in the aisle ""I WAS ONCE RAPED IN FRONT OF MY TWO SONS."" She used to work with part time crew (so basically the college/h.s. kids, some of them being underaged) &amp; she would pick up random stuff in the store &amp; tell the guys how it could be a sex toy. For example she picked up a flyswatter, said it's the Texas Flyswatter, pretended to slap one of the guys in the ass &amp; said ""What's your number?"" She wasn't allowed to work with us after that &amp; eventually got fired.


This one lady was straight up disgusting. She was in her late 20s, early 30s &amp; looked like she was 16. I'm not 100% sure if she was on drugs, but overall she looked pretty cracked out. She always started drama. For instance, one time she wanted other employees fired so she smeared her shit on the bathroom wall &amp; tried to blame it on other employees. Apparently her plumbing stopped working in their apartment so they shit in buckets &amp; poured it on the floor when she &amp; her family got evicted. Her kid was always sick. When she got fired from the thrift store she got hired at the local bakery...



There was a creepy man that was known as the ""shoeman"" because he handled the shoes. He was missing teeth &amp; always hit on all the women that worked there. He always made me uncomfortable. He would be hammered while on the clock half the time. I remember when we added a charity to our store, people from the charity came and had a little party to promote their charity. The shoeman was pretty wasted and shouted stuff at the heads of the charity during their presentation. He eventually got fired &amp; arrested for stealing from the woman who smeared shit on the wall's purse.
There was a lot of drugged out people in general. People coked out &amp; pill poppin like crazy. One lady used to smash a 40 oz on her break in her car &amp; do lines off her steering wheel. Another lady, who worked there for like a week, used to ask the employees if they were drug addicts. She used to be like, ""I love drugs: coke, PCP, oxycotton, you name it."" 


One lady just topped them all. We called her Crazy Cari. She was in her 40s &amp; worked with all the high school//college kids part time. She didn't do shit, I hated her on busy days. But she was pretty batshit insane. She used to come into work fucked up all the time. Our manager lived in the same apartment complex as her dealer I guess. Crazy Cari would look in her windows for her when she was all fucked up. She once came into work and was like ""I took a Xanax bar &amp; I just drank an energy drink to reverse it."" She used to just walk up and down the aisles looking confused, barely cleaning up. We called her ""Peanut"" in the beginning because we found her hiding in the production room of the store eating peanuts. Her first week, she fell asleep in a rocking chair that was on the sales floor towards the end of her shift. I couldn't comprehend why the kept her besides entertainment purposes because she was so crazy. She used to talk to the high school girls about how beautiful ballsacks were and she confided in one of the girls that the shoeman came over to her apartment and basically raped her. One of our supervisors wouldn't schedule her a lot because she would always slack off. Crazy Cari would come in &amp; yell at her saying all this random shit like ""My mom's gonna die &amp; I'm alone."" We met her mom, she was fine. She was never alone when she came to visit, she always had gross looking drugged out men with her. We brought this to the attention of the manager because she was threatening towards to the supervisor &amp; employees. He ignored us. She eventually got fired...for firing a gun at the stuffed animals.

Gimick,8,10,1r0n8k,26,"I work at an office/warehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving. We are technically a distributor, so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases, but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture, we also answer calls about defective merchandise. 

In the industry I work in, almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we make/distribute. We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise, where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund. Fine. It's no big deal, we usually just replace it. 

I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product. I go through the motions to make sure it's not just some kind of user error, and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem. She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new one.

I ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address. Well, naturally I have to ask about it. It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well. It is odd, but not unheard of, so I let it go.

After I get the information I need to process the replacement order, I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product. At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two. Hmm.

I assume she meant her daughters order, and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order, and that both would arrive on the same day. She corrected me, telling me that is not what she meant.

She then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with. I try to figure out why, which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she bought.

I repeatedly try to get her back on track, as I would rather not dally on the phone all day. Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves two.

Apparently instead of calling when her item broke, she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item. It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement, but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item. That is speculation, of course.

Either way, she felt since she bought a second item (which works perfectly, according to her), I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new, less expensive one. 

I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people, but to me, the math is off. Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her, as she purchased the item through a retailer, we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situation.

Am I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base? Is this sort of compensation common in other industries? 

Honestly, it made the entire replacement order suspicious. Your thoughts?",I Should Get Two,36
lostxfreakx42,2,2,1qy3dy,26,"I did a small stint at the blue vested store as a cashier over Christmas last year. I was reminded the other day of a few stories from that time in my life so here is one.

We had this one woman and her mom who would come in fairly regularly. I would end up checking them out every once in a while. The daughter was heavily pregnant and would drive one of those motorized scooters around the store.

One day, the daughter came in with a friend and between the two of them, they picked out almost $1500 of baby clothes and accessories and clothes for themselves and just dumped it all on top of the belt, leaving all the hangars in a big tangled mess. I had to stop the belt and take everything off the hangars so I could get at the tags to scan them and they didn't like how long it took. They just laughed as I untangled everything and kept saying to each other, ""What's taking so long??"" The pregnant one kept calling her friend a whore and threatened to run her over with the scooter. 

Once I finally had it all untangled and scanned, pregnant girl zoomed off after calling her friend a whore once more. Her friend was left to pay the $1500 bill and began digging through her purse. 

She spent nearly 10 minutes digging a whole bunch of crumpled $10 and $20 bills out of the bottom of her purse and when that didn't add up, began digging for loonies and toonies. Meanwhile the line is steadily forming behind her.

Once all her crumpled money is out and counted, pregnant girl zooms back and tells her whore friend to, ""hurry the fuck up"" or else she'll ""pee in the car."" Not even a thank you to her friend for buying her all these baby clothes. Then they left.

Of course I always check to see if it's true. I go on their website and call from a private line. I also ask the following questions:

1. Do you have it in stock?
If they don't, that's usually the main reason why they are asking for the price match. They can't get their hands on it over at XYZ. 

If they do have it in stock...

2. What colours or styles do you carry? (if applicable)
Doesn't make sense for me to do a price match if they don't stock the same colours or styles as my store.

Despite verifying the price of a product at XYZ if they don't have exactly what the customer wants then I won't entertain the thought of a price match. 

We also refuse to price match with big box stores because they are able to buy pallets and can afford to sell at a lower price which we can't. 

Some companies we sign an agreement every year to agree to sell at the MSRP to balance out the playing field among stores. I know some managers who call up distributors and reps to rat out other stores that advertise a lower price.

arizean,12,8,1qqwwp,25,"So there's a double meaning to the title. One is that I was in the hospital recently, which is a bit of a complicated story, and two is the huge mistake I made only a few days before I went in to the hospital.

So I work at a combo pharmacy and retail store. A popular chain with a very strange array of customers. Anyways, there is a policy that any and all found items should be handed in to management so they can cross check IDs and stuff I guess. Great. Would have been wonderful had I been told before this happened. I should have done better, and I know now that I was a complete moron. Still, I suppose this makes a good story.

So a pharmacy tech gets off her shift. Drops her wallet in the parking lot. Someone finds it, hands it in. I put it off to the side of the counter. 

We get a call. It's the pharmacy tech, asking about her wallet, I let her know we have it.

Not too long after that a woman comes in with her mother and describes the wallet, saying she lost it. Heres the huge mistake, I gave it to her. So stupid of me.

The pharmacy techs boyfriend comes and asks about it. Than my manager had to call the police and the store manager. All I could think was two things ""I'm a horrible person."" and ""I'm in so much trouble.""

I work at a big-box retail store, specifically in the Electronics and Wireless phones department.

This becomes even funnier when you know what she looks like: early 60's and about 5' tall: the small spitfire type.

**Story**:
There’s a symphony of light, the color blue, and the beeping of checkout scanners ablaze. In its midst, there’s me-and this very ornery customer. Welcome to the front end of ***-mart. 

The trouble starts when she announces she’s purchasing medicines for her church. She looks about eighteen, so I have to card her for the Nyquil. That was a fun conversation.

“Sometimes you’ve got to appreciate the small things,” she says by way of apology.

dichotomies,9,26,1r2lgs,19,"Here’s a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank (not BoA). It happened several years ago. 


The story starts about a week prior in a dream. I rarely remember my dreams, but this one stuck out to me. I remembered many details, from how things were said, and the feelings expressed. I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream; it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up. 


Fast forward to “today.” I sit down and help a 20 something customer (“John”) who is sorting out his dad’s accounts. John’s dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas. A semi plowed into him. As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it. But, moving on. We have paperwork to do. I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department (I faxed it to them). As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son (John) and daughter (“Sarah”) beneficiaries (POD = payable on death). This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank. After having the death certificate approved by the legal department, and verifying John’s ID, I start to talk to John about his dad’s accounts. I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks, “one made out to each of you.” 


Now, this is before smartphones and he doesn’t have the number for his sister on his phone. I think it was because she had just moved or something. John had an address book with him and said, “I’m pretty sure it’s in here. Let me take a look.”


It was at this point that it all clicked into place for me. It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open. I knew, for at least the next minute, exactly what was going to happen. I have never had this sensation before, or after. Normally I get this feeling after something happens (déjà vu). This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyes.


He looks through his address book and can’t find his sister’s number. A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things, or where he wrote things down, so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number. I have to bite my lip to not say anything. I KNOW that his sister’s number is right in his address book. I am so confident that I want to say, “No, it’s in there. Look again.” I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son, bereaving the unexpected death of his father. John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit, then looks again in his address book. He finds it this time. 


I honestly can’t remember why we needed to call her (this was about 10 years ago), but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterday.


As I told this story you might have been thinking, “But this sounds trivial and minor, what gives?” Well, I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough, and I knew it while I was experiencing it. That is kinda freaky. 


I am an agnostic, and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open. Just thought that I’d share with you guys. Thanks for reading.

nihlius,1,6,1qygoh,21,"So I work at a popular office supplies store, and most days I'm on are pretty dead, so I tend to remember most people who come in more than once. However, this tale is about a pair of guys who waltzed in at about 5:50 on a Sunday evening. Both of them look to be between 20-25, sweatpants, hoodies, general casual clothes. I'm a decent distance from them, but I greet them regardless. 

I only get some mumbles back, but that's okay, maybe they're third shift workers who just got up or something? I want judging yet. 

They come to the only open register (mine) about 10 minutes later with a popular office chair, which, with tax, comes out to being just over 100USD. When they start pulling out ones, I knew it just turned all sideways. 

Once I was starting to count their money, I smelled the distinct scent of weed, but hey, whatever, stoners need chairs too, right? 

Two twenties, sixty seven ones, and 80 cents in change later, they start to leave....without the chair. The box is still on the counter. 

I called out to them, and they both turned around. After a second, I get 'We need....a cart.' They were both plenty big enough to carry the box, it wasn't heavy either. So they came back with a cart, deposited the chair into the cart, and proceeded to leave.

Except they parked the cart in the main entrance (keeping the automatic doors open), and disappearing into the aisles again. By this point, everyone on at the time is smirking and the supervisor is trying not to laugh. No one moved the cart, and no one came in during the period it was sitting in the doorway, and after about 10 minutes, the dynamic duo exited the store with their chair.

SleepKittySleep,4,8,1qyf6u,18,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a hostess that works only mornings and double shifts on weekends. I am a 20 year old girl who is nice to everyone.

**Background:** I work at a Tex-Mex restaurant that's known for its patio. People mostly come to eat outside on the patio, not for the food in particular. It can seat up to 1,600 people and takes up a city block. It's been open over 50 years and is family run. There are at least over 150 people employed. About 9-17 waiters/waitresses work inside and about 25 outside during the weekends. There are 2-3 busboys per section, 16 hostesses in total (4 work inside/rest outside), there are 3 kitchens, and 4 managers (all related). 

It can get VERY busy on the weekends. There's a hostess to each section and I usually work the line. Most of the times there is an hour to 2 hour wait to be seated. It takes a person with a lot of patience to be able to work the line. We have to be able to walk through every time while having people complain and yell about the wait. There are a lot self-entitled people who throw around a manager's name. Doesn't look, hard but it is. People do get mean when they're hungry.

First manager (L) is head manager. He's real laid back and awesome. Second is (J) cool, but tough and scary. He basically runs everything. Third (Z) is sort of...bipolar I guess. She is awesome one second, but mean the next. Tends to mess things up. She works mostly inside. Third is (B), a lazy ass who only works 3 hours at the end of everyday. She only knows how to complain. She HATES me. Everyone hates her too though. I see her 3 days out of the week.

**Story:** This took place on the patio Sunday night around 7:00p.m. There were only 3 hours till closing. Besides me, there were 5 other hostesses outside. Our line had just ended and I was ready to finally start walking around. When we work line we're not suppose to move from the front unless necessary since we have a clipboard on who is next to be seated.

As soon as **B** arrives we all groan. She always has some thing to complain about. ALWAYS. At least **Z** guides us, but **L** literally does nothing. Most of us have no clue to what she contributes to this restaurant.

Anyways, people are coming and going. We're giving our usual ""Hey, how are you?"" ""Enjoy!"" ""Have a good night!"" We're all in a good mood. Every one of us are taking turns seating tables. We're all doing are part. This was going on for about 20 minutes until it finally died down. Our head hostess was was taking care of the busboys and their stations, 3 hostesses were helping put tablecloths while me and (A)we're watching the front.

I had just came from a section in the back after seating table. I was literally at the front for two minutes before **B** comes up to A and I.

B then asks, ""Do you know a Mexican man with red shirt is sitting? He was with his girlfriend or something.""

We both reply no. This was not acceptable.

""Really? You don't know. He was just here."" Her smile faltering.

A is really sweet, nice and doesn't like to get in trouble, so I reply for her, ""The other hostesses might have sat them.""

""Who else is here?""

I answer with the same fake smile she has and name the other 4 hostesses.

She's getting a bit mad now, ""And none of you know where you sat him?"" She looks at both of us in disbelief then looks at A and asks, ""What section are you at?""

After A answers she asks who is doing line-up. I reply that I am. At this point I know this conversation isn't going to be pleasant. They never are. For some reason, the moment we met we did not get along. I guess it's cause I hate that she's self-centered and spoiled for her age. Also, because with her I tend to be a smart ass.

""You really don't remember him? He was wearing a red shirt."" She snorts.

It took me all I had to not reply back with a smart ass comment. There was literally a man with a red shirt in front of me. So I say, ""After a while, everyone looks the same to me.""

She laughs, ""Are you serious? Can't you remember anybody? You don't remember him?""

""I didn't seat him. I just took a table to OU. It wasn't me.""

She then ""calls me out"", ""You're lying. Ten minutes ago you were standing up here when he was here. I was talking to the cop.""

I knew she was lying. I was being honest. I saw hundreds of people this morning. I do line. I can guarantee that if you're sitting in the patio I saw your face at least once. Eventually, you're only a number to me. Not a face. I worked a double that day with a non stop rush. I was tired.

""Well then I don't remember. They all look the same to me."" I smile.

Still smiling, she looks at me. I can tell she's expecting an apology. Hell no. I smile just as big.

After 15 seconds of awkward smiling, she turns to A and says, ""Unbelievable! Do you remember everyone you seat?""

A is stuttering unable to answer. I can tell she wants to stick up for me, but she doesn't want to get in trouble.

Luckily, a waitress (D/ also her cousin) also works as assistant manager some times, comes and begins to talk to her. She leaves as I laugh at her.

Turns out this Mexican man with a red shirt had only moved her furniture.

**TL;DR** Manager searches for man who moved her furniture.

It may not seem like a big deal, but she has this way about her that I just despise. Sorry it was long. I wanted to give an idea of how big this place is.

Edit: I can't name correctly. :(",Man with the red shirt,26
ixiduffixi,4,2,1r5xvj,18,"So I was reading through another user's lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own. 

In my teenage years, my first job was working for the ""blue vest mafia."" My job description was something along the lines of ""Customer Service Specialist,"" which amounted to cart pusher, cashier, stockman, and basic maintenance. Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader. This tale involves one of those nights. 

When I worked on unloading my shift started at 3 p.m. We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse. The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver, and driven around the building to the warehouse. There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside. The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrance's sidewalk. This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door. This most commonly took place during store hours. (Not all of them are 24hrs.) Any way on to the story.

One day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock. This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour. Then the forktruck didn't return. I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse. When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight. I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off. The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone. I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer. They had apparently been talking for quite some time, because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office. When I asked what happened, my coworker got very, very upset. To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area. 

What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down. The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance. Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it. I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hours.

**BONUS STORY**

Another tale of the blue vest mafia. 

One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink, giggling, while his friend was in the stall also giggling. I took my time using the restroom, waiting them out, which eventually worked. While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something. 

After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies, sinus medication, and dvds. I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras. The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didn't stop until they were well outside. We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids. ",A Lot Of Stories Today,20
iamseanpreel,24,6,1r4ifk,18,"I work for a huge company that sells jeans mainly. We follow laws and regulations word for word, regardless of the situation since we have such high traffic.
One of the rules we follow VERY strictly is asking for ID when the back of someone's card isn't signed. I know a lot of stores don't do this, but we do.
Most of the time people have their IDs and everything goes smoothly

But every now and then we get people who decide it's okay to cuss at us and call us rude names because they don't have their identification on them and we deny the sale with that card.

People get hostile and today a guy actually tried to get me to let him do his own transaction because he didn't have his ID.

I don't understand why people just don't carry ther ID on them at all times though...","Sorry for obeying the law, everyone.",24
WhatsAnEnigma,16,8,1r1dog,18,"First time using Alien Blue on my phone. 



So this is more of a question than a tale. It's my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards. 




I work in a corner store in the south. A guy comes in and wants to put 300$ on a Green Dot card. He gives me a handful of 20$'s that reeks of weed. No biggie. I don't care where you get your money. I ring him up. Have a nice day. 




He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesn't work. I try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong. I again try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. And let me just say now that he was very, very ""southern"" so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too. 




I go to lunch and when I get back he's walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because ""I obviously don't have any money since this card screwed me over"". I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store.  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check. I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that I'm glad they'll fix it for him. He walks back to his car and I think ""gee, that's a pretty expensive car for a for a guy who's barely 20"".  But whatever. Lucky guy I guess. But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot. 





Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot. He comes back in and gets another 300$ Green Dot since the other one was bad. I don't understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesn't have money for cigs. But I don't ask questions cuz I'm new to this job and I just do what I'm told. He buys it and leaves. And then sits in the parking lot for another hour. I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes. I think that maybe he's just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I don't want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed. (I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid).  




Well. The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at 150$ a piece. But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they aren't together. I'm just really weirded out because they're acting like they don't know each other. Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour. I don't mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldn't worry about it. 





The guys leave. I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because there's a green dot limit. 




So....what was this guy doing?

supersporky,8,6,1qq65t,19,"Ugh I just wanted to kick this older guy in the face just now. It seems that he always has some sort of problem with me and how the owner runs the store. 

He wanted to special order a set of scrubs and has the tags of what he wants, which is awesome and easier for me too. I get the order set up and he is rushing to get the check written before I ring up the items. I tell him the total and ask to see a valid form of ID because not only is it store policy to check and make sure the DL number is on there but also to get a phone number if we need to call them because of *insert whatever reason there is* .

The policy has been like this and is clearly posted on the desk along with a sign that says if you write us a bad check, not only do you have to pay that amount, but you also owe an additional $30 to cover the cost of the bounced check (other stores may vary). 

I let him know that I know it can be inconvenient and annoying but that it is store policy, so could you please go and get it? He does but when he comes back inside, he won't take it out of his wallet and **COVERS** the address. *Which is on the check he just wrote*. He proceeds to ask me *sarcastically* if there are anymore hoops that he needs to jump through to make a purchase. I stare at him right in the eyes (asserting my dominance) and tell him no. He did not get a smile or a have a good night. He doesn't deserve one.

After he left I wrote down in the customer accounts notes that this gentleman refuses to show any form of identification and to call the owner and see what they want to do with his money. Hopefully his check does not bounce and I wont have to deal with him again.


What would you have done?",Another short rant about ID's,25
Sapphires13,5,5,1r8o2i,26,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""  
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""  
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""  
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""  
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""  
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""  

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""  
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""  
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]  
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""  
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""  
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""  
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",31

So this morning, I haul ass out of the house and spend exactly 10 minutes nomming down a slightly stale frosted blueberry donut (which later made me sick to my stomach) and some reconstituted from powder orange juice with my son so that I could go down and work the book fair.

I'm standing there, bagging stuff up for Mrs. BorgImplant (the librarian) when a dad comes up to me.

And he hands me one of these large Lego minifig dictionaries (we have several--regular general minifigs, one that's Ninjago and a Harry Potter one). Now the minifig dictionaries/encycolpedias generally have a cutout bit on the front cover that has a plastic container inside that contains a minifig.

Only with this particular dictionary, the minifig has been taken out. It's not difficult to do, to be honest. It's designed to be easy to open for the kids, I guess. Since the minifig was ripped off, we offered to give the dad a $5 discount off the price (it was $40) but he declined and I shoved it in the back with the rest of the books that had shit ripped off them. We get a good number of books, mostly paperback, that have cheap crappy jewelery attached and those things get ripped off all the damn time.

The next day she comes back and throws a tantrum why didn't you do the list? I responded with ""I did, I did a few things and didn't finish because I was swamped with customers. I did other things that weren't on the list did you notice that?"" 

""Yeah but you didn't do what's on the list.""

""Because I was busy, I noticed we were low on other merchandise and dealt with those, I didn't do the things on the list because that's all we have there is no more. So I did what I thought was urgent.""

""Ok but you didn't finish the list.""

I almost lost it at that point. Her entire argument was I didn't do the things on the redundant  list but I still did my job.  She complained to upper management about it and they took her side over mine. She later slipped in my performance review would be low.

Cleverness,8,11,1r00wc,16,"So I started working retail in July at a big box store as a cashier in NYC.  I actually am enjoying myself here, the customers at this store are mostly great and there has been no major problems.  The management is great with scheduling me around class, sick days, etc, and there are few things that I take notice of.  Still, alot of people pointed out to me that retail is evil and that I will eventually became insane myself from doing so.  So I figure I'll post some things here that I encounter(I have other things besides this) as someone who is in his 20's and new to retail to see if anyone enjoys or relates to it.  Long intro but yea, let's carry on.

So in my store it's not uncommon for people to bring things up to the register, say they changed their minds, and hand it to me.  I do not mind this at all.  Infact I encourage it, seeing merchandise placed in random places of the store where they don't belong annoys me more than anything.  We can neatly sort it and send the items to their proper departments if they hand it to us cashiers.  

What I do not like are those who bring up a cart full of stuff, and after ringing everything up the card is declined.  Alot of times it will be because they are from out of state and the companies do it for their protection, a quick call and its resolved, I recall the transaction if I needed to suspend it and we finish up(alot of the out of towners btw are great, they are very friendly.  Had a long chat with a guy from LA that I can't be too descriptive about to reveal where I work).  Sometimes though, someone will come up with a cart full of items, their card(s) will get declined, and they either A) remove alot of the merchandise, but once a card is declined I can't back out to the scanning menu for this transaction and have to start all over again.  A minor pet peeve.  Or of course B) they say ""I'll get my other card from home"" and never return.  So we have a cart full of items that now need to go back.

It just boggles me how people don't keep track of what they can spend.  Do they just grab whatever without looking at the price? I can understand being a few dollars off(I have some leeway I can do with discounts if I see someone is short and they aren't a douche) but off by 100-200 dollars? Really?

At this store,  there are TONS of tiny little items (earrings, bracelets ect.) That tend to go missing pretty often, but its to be expected, as the store is so small and under staffed there is no way to keep it from happening. You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever.

Greenwallets,10,4,1r52ex,13,"Hey guys. So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company. Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer, which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space. 

The issues we're experiencing, largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there. They're most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time (benefits, base pay + commission) as the assistant manager for this new employer.  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks, and I've had associates/managers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer. In a tone that makes it feel as though I have ""betrayed"" them in some way. 

I know it's jealousy from the associates, but it's affecting our relationship with the retailer. There's a very distinct ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us. We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isn't buying a cellular device or related accessory. Specifically, there is one associate who has made rude comments about my manager(s) and I in our vicinity, in addition to physically trying to walk through me. I should mention she did this when I worked there as well- she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there. Did I mention she's 28?

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment, and how you went about rectifying the situation. I should say that my manager isn't likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role. She's also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer. She's too much of a sweetheart, I'm a cynical realist when it comes to this store.",(Meta) how do you deal with a toxic work environment?,17
Itorres89,3,8,1r3iy4,14,"So I'm working for a big box retail store. We just recently got a new-ish store manager. He was originally an assistant store manager but they put him in charge of another store in our city (I say ""put in charge"" because he wasn't put through STORE management training until AFTER that store closed down) and then transferred to our store as our old a$$hat of a manager got himself transferred cross country.

Anyway, this guy comes in, seems nice enough but he's barely been at our store a week and he's already drastically changing things. I've been at that store for about 4 years, he's been with the company about 2. He hasn't directly wronged me yet but he's developing a bit of a rep with the other associates for favoritism. Things are chaos. People don't even know what they'll be working for ~~Black Friday~~ yet. I'm supposed to be on the ""softlines"" side, but I'm working ""hardlines.""

I've seen my share of management changes and I've noticed that any new manager that starts trying to drastically change things right away (I'd say within the first month or so) isn't a very good manager. With him changing things this close to the holidays I'm thinking we're gonna have a bad time....

TL;DR: Newbie manager fixing what ain't broke.

Anyone else have any input/stories?

wattthefuck,2,5,1qxzbq,13,"A couple of years ago I worked for a really big retail store and was part of a really tight knit back room unloading crew. One day we were all coming back in from break together and a couple was walking out. When I say walking, I mean one was riding on one of the store scooters and the other one was walking beside them. The one on the scooter jokingly swerves the thing and almost hits one of my coworkers. Everybody, including the driver, laughs it off and continues with the rest of the night.
The next day, our Asset Protection guy came to us and told us that the couple last night was part of a bigger operation that was hitting all of the stores within a 60 mile radius for about $1,000 every couple of nights. I'm not going to go into detail about how they went about stealing goods but included cutting off spider wire and was pretty intense. When questioned about the night before, everyone thought that someone in the crew knew the couple and that's why everyone laughed when we were almost run over. This happened to a couple more stores in nearby cities but they were never caught. They definitely made a pretty penny. ",They Just Walked On By...,18
JasonNBD,3,9,1qxy70,10,"It was the start of my shift at the grocery store, I was looking for my manager and walked into one of the aisles (had to google spelling). I see a group huddled around a man, this guy had just had a seziur and was dazed. My manager had a blanket around him, and was giving him water, I could see there was a tiny bit of blood on the floor because he must have hit his head on the fall down.

Couple minutes pass by, and two big paramedics show up with a stretcher, and start talking to the man. With around 4 people plus the paramedics right in this guys face, he started to get nervous and attempted to get up. The paramedics both held him back ""whoa whoa not so fast there"" one of them said. They held him back and told him to sit down. He kept trying to stand up, and finally did.

This guy had a blank expression on his face, he reminded me of a wild deer or animal. The paramedics franticly try to get him to sit down, he lunges at one of the paramedics and tries punching him.  The two paramedics attempt to calm him down, approaching him slowley. The old man then targets the second paramedic and lunges at him with a sucker punch. He backs himself into a wall and his pants had fallen to his knees, showing only his boxers. He targets my bystanding manager and tries running after him with his pants down. He doesn't get very far. The paramedics blocked off the aisle to stop him from attacking any customers. The police came soon after and took the old man away.

Evenstar22,0,10,1qwl4z,10,"I know, I know. It's been a year since I posted part 1. So roast me. 

Anyway, back to the story. I spent the weekend celebrating with a mate and drinking cheap beer, thinking that my troubles were over. Little did I know, they had just begun.

I came in Monday at 8. The fat man was wondering around muttering under his breath when I arrived, and one of the floor employees, we'll call him Rock Man, brought me coffee and an egg sandwich. Awesomesauce, we were off to a good start.

I headed into the goldfish bowl, munching on my egg sandwich, and noticed that the smell had intensified since my last visit. Oh well. I'd just pick up some air freshener, right? Though today I am convinced the fat man must have been jizzing all over the office. Anyway, I took my seat at the desk and spent several uneventful hours cashing people out as the hive of activity intensifies.

The Rod man turned up. He was a great guy and a Mate of Steve, the aforementioned awesome GM. He introduces himself and keeps the staring down my top to a minimum, and as a consequence I gladly fetch the Fat Man for him. He wants to know why his georgian cedar table is not on the floor for Auction- he delivered it Wednesday. Now the fat man, I am to learn, has a bad habit of selling items off the floor, pocketing the cash, and going and spending it on 1)the waif, his boytoy, 2) late night meals or 3) random shit that takes his fancy (once this was enough pez packets to keep the entire staff going for months).

Unfortunately the other half of his bad habit was not remembering how much he had sold these items for, and regularly lying to consignors about where their items had disappeared to. He manages to placate the Rod man but comes back with a bit of a temper on, and stomps into his back office for several hours. Not that I mind. Basically far less smelly when he isn't close enough for his unwashed odour to take up it's own postcode.

I put it out of my mind and keep cashing people out. It reaches about 9pm and the long day is finally over, the black widow (so named because she never wore anything else and had a bizarre sort of gravitational pull) and I have managed to cash out, and I have managed to prove that no, we aren't short. This would become a regular issue while she was still my boss, as I would later discover she had been stuffing cash in envelopes and embezzling, then balancing the books with some sort of arachnid off mathematics.

Dave heads past me and into the Boss's lair. Except he isn't there, and he's the only one with safe keys. I follow Dave upon hearing the loud stream of expletives pouring out his mouth, and discover the stench that is the small enclosed room where the Fat Man keeps his floor mattress, numerous bags of half empty take-out, and the daily take.

The mattress has no sheets, smells, and some interesting looking stains on it, and strewn across it is the Boss's single pair of filthy overalls that he wore each and every day and never seemed to wash. I know they were the same pair, because the were all torn at the shoulder. Steve calls Matt, his second in command in, and the black widow takes the opportunity to bugger off home while none of us are looking.

So in our hands we have 30k in cash, a warehouse we can't lock the doors too, and some dirty overalls. We are debating one of us staying there, or just leaving. Steve finally says that he is going to have to search the Fat Man's overalls to see if we are lucky enough to find his keys still in his pockets.

Pocket 1. No. Pocket 2. Steve reaches in with a look of fear (fairly so) and pulls out something fabric. And kind of white. In a flash he drops them, and his face whitens a little. And we all realize with dawning horror that these are The Fat Man's skidmark stained tighty whities. I, fortunately, had hand sanitizer in my purse, and graciously handed him the bottle and told him there was no need to give it back.

The keys were found, in that same pocket, and we were saved. But poor Steve never recovered. And we never managed to figure out how The Fat Man managed to leave without a staff of 20 and countless people noticing, nor what he wore. Because in the entire 6 months I was to work there, I never saw him wearing anything but those overalls.....

Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

-I'm taken aback and instantly angry. I've gotten to the point where I don't react well to rude customers on the phone.

M: Due to a number of economic reasons we've focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves. It helps small companies like us stay competitive.

zobe910,8,10,1qynfk,0,"Okay, so a former coworker (and friend) of mine posted this on her [blog](http://curlycrankycollegegirl.tumblr.com/) and I just wanted to share it with you all since some of us fast food workers can definitely relate. And the rest of you can learn from this.

[Edited from OP for content, chain/product names. I personally edited and added to the list below, as well.]

""I think it is important for everyone in America to hold a job in food service. That way, the human race will start to evolve from total jerks, thinking they are entitled to order a six piece chicken strip basket at the window after spending three and a half minutes just to order a large oreo [treat], to normal human beings. 
Fast food is still FOOD. Granted, the job is not as glamorous as being the editor in chief for a magazine or head chef at a high class restaurant in So-cal,  but end the end it is still a job. 
I think it is high time that society gets rid of the stereotype that only losers work in the food industry. I honestly enjoyed my time working at [ice cream/fast food restaurant], minus the rough moments. Ask anyone. I would go back in a heartbeat. My coworkers became my friends (minus the stupid ones). And I will always look back at the memories I created. 

I got the job when the neighborhood's popular [playcenter] closed for the first time in over 15 years. [Playcenter] had been apart of my life since I was 4 years old and my mom started working there. I was well versed in how the business was run. At age 5, I was running the front of the center, greeting customers and stamping play cards as well as working the snack counter in the back. At age 7, I started helping my mom work birthday parties. By age 15, I was in the store by myself from open to close. [Playcenter] wasn’t a job, it was a life style. 
[Playcenter] had changed hands many times. Luckily for my mom and I, the previous owners always put in a good word for us and we kept our jobs. That was until 2012. 
Due to some underhanded non-sense I was not apart of, my mother and I did not make the transfer over to the new owners. For the first time in my life….I had to FIND a job. 

Luckily, my bff came through for me yet again and put in a good word for me at _____. Then my future in ice cream began. 

When I was first starting out, it was rough. My co-workers and I didn't know each other, I couldn't memorize how many scoops of candy went into cookie dough [treat], and customers were mean. 
I hope if there is one thing you take from this particular post, you take away a new awareness for the workers at fast food establishments. Anyone who is employed deserves respect, no matter what the job is. Minus people at the DMV. (They hate their lives). 

I have learned many life lessons at _______. Most of them from my co-workers. Most of them from my manager (he has common sense). Most of them involving the negative aspects of prostitution. (But that’s besides the point)
The most important thing I learned from working at _____ was how to order in drive through. And now I am going to share this great knowledge with you.""

I give you the 13 commandments for ordering fast food.

1. ""Welcome to ___________. How can I take your order?""
Speak loudly and clearly. DO NOT HAVE THE PASSENGER ORDER; we usually can't hear them.

2. Feel free to say hi to who ever is taking your order. DO NOT ask how their day was. DO NOT repeat their name to them. *Its weird*. Just order. 

3. Make sure your kids aren't screaming and your dog isn't barking. It kills our ears over the headset, we can't hear you (the driver), and it's just rude.

4. DO NOT ask what our favorite item is. 1) We usually don't have a preference. 2) If you don’t know what you want: **GO INSIDE OR JUST GO HOME**. 

5. If you need more time to decide, politely tell the order person that you are “still deciding"" or ""need a moment”. The number one thing to remember is to notify the worker when you are done deciding. Communication is key. 

6. When ordering: ITEM/COMBO#. SIZE. FLAVOR. If you are getting a combo, know what you want to drink. 

7. Notify us early if you have coupons. It's easier to apply the discount when we are initially ringing you up versus making changes at the window.

8. Don't bitch about the prices. We don't make them. If you know the biggest US fast food chain right across the street sells the same ice cream cone *""for like, a dollar""*, go there then. We'll happily cancel your order for you. (Our ice cream tastes much better, anyways..)

9. Please try to make sure you have your cash/card readily available when you get to the window, ESPECIALLY if you are waiting in a line of cars in front of you. You have no excuse to not be ready when you pull up to the window. Plus you are wasting everyone's time by digging through your purse for a full minute. **AND NEVER PAY IN ALL COINS**. By the time we're done counting that shit out, your ice cream has already melted. 

10. Get off your phone. If we try to ask you a question and you don't hear us, that's your problem. Now you are *definitely* not getting any ketchup with your fries.

11. Don't add on food at the window. It adds to our drive time, and time is money. Plus, everyone else now has to wait another 2-3 minutes or more for your 6-piece chicken strip basket to cook. 

12. Mistakes happen. Feel free to **(preferably)** come inside, or roll back through the drive through and very quickly explain the situation. We will be happy to fix something for you as long as you don't bitch about it. In that case, we will *spitefully* fix something for you. :-)

13. And pretty please don't come through the drive through high off your ass. I learned what weed smells like at my job. This is not what I had in mind when I was told I'd gain ""life experience"" by working.

—curlygirl— [and zobe910]

TL;DR: Know what you want when you come through the drive through, have your money ready, and don't be rude. Fast food is an unforgiving job.

I've been staring at the white walls of the video game store for about 2 hours since lunch. It was a very slow day, I glanced at the tables in front of the store,and my heart ache. It was the donation table for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda that wretched my country and even though I have donated what I can, I still feel sad whenever I saw the people on the TV suffering. 

I was broken out of my thoughts when the doors jingled open . Customers, finally!

She was a small girl, about 10 or 11 and a pink Hello Kitty backpack was at her small back. Her mother was accompanying her, a few plastic bags in tow. I recognized her mom. When I was selling cigarettes on the street, I see her peddling clothes she made herself on her stall at the market. She now has her own online shop and making a name for herself. 

The daughter just had a birthday and her mom finally has enough money to buy a PS3 and some games. 

The girl half-jogged, half-skipped to my counter. She opened her backpack and pulled out a console. Her mom handed me the bag full of games.

""Can I return this?""

""Sure sweetie, no problem.""

I inspected at the console and the games, and nothing was opened. Per policy, I returned the money to the mom. She handed the money to the girl, and she ran off as fast as her little feet can take her. I was about to ask when the mom, seeing my expression, explained.

""She wants to sell her birthday gift, so she can donate to the victims.""

I honestly teared a bit there. She was willing to give up what was supposed to be hers and gave to those in need. That's real generosity out there.

While I was watching her talking to the girl at the donations table, I was reminded that even though there are a lot of selfish assholes in the world, there's a person just like that little girl and I was happy.

Edit: Yolanda and Hayain are the same typhoon.

Personsen,445,651,1qvk5o,1620,"[](/lyranotsure)I'm not a huge fan of coupons in general. There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired, they don't scan, or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up (which is a pet peeve of mine). If you want to use one or two coupons, I am fine with that. I completely understand wanting to save some money.

But there is a trend that pisses me off to no end.  

""Couponers"".  

A lady came in a while back, with a large amount of deodorant in her basket. After I finished ringing her up, she said,  
""Oh and I have a few coupons...""  

She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse.  None of them having scannable bar codes, meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually. I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to.  

She notices I am reading them and says ""Yeah. Those should pay for the entire transaction.""  

""I'm sorry, it says limit one coupon per customer and that they aren't to be used with any other coupons."" I reply.  

""No. I did the math. I have enough here to cover the entire transaction. In fact, you guys should technically be giving *me* cash back."" she says with a chuckle.  

At this point the line was piling up again on my register, so I called up a third cashier and the manager.  

The manager comes up and asks how he can help.  

She says ""Yeah this guy won't let me use my coupons.""  

I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons can't be used like this.  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for free.

Before she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her. She says ""You should be expecting more of us.  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here. Next time just scan the damn coupons"" She then struts out the door with a smile.  

The manager was fired soon after.  ","Fuck. ""Couponers"".",2271
FredFltStn,207,489,1qz4m9,1227,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

The manager on duty, however, was having NO theft on his watch(mind you, this mountain of a man's nickname is ""The Punisher). He immediately chases after them and yells to the cashier on duty to ""Call the fuckin' cops!"". As he gets to the parking lot, they're speeding off in their getaway Sedona, but do you think that stopped the Punisher? No. As they're speeding off to retire in style after their successful heist, my SALARIED MANAGER proceeds to THROW A DAMN SHOPPING CART at their car, busting out their window. When he got on the phone with the cops, he merely said, ""Yeah they're in the white Sedona with no rear window.""

Disclaimer: Standard stuff. First time post, Massive wall of text, etc.

Background: I work at a small, privately owned retro game store. You name it, I have something for it.

Now this tale takes place a few days after GTA 5 came out. You see, on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do: playing SNES games on one of our displays. On the rare occasion when a customer would come in, I'd pause my game, greet them and offer whatever help I could provide, then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store. Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

FredFltStn,119,321,1r2ps1,954,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  We get our fair share of Spanish speaking customers at my location, and I try to have at least one cashier working that can speak Spanish, just to smooth things along. I don’t speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish). I was actually busy trying to stock one of the shelves at the time, so I shook my head no and held up one finger for the universal “one moment” sign. I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

About 10 minutes later, the two guys are shopping on the aisle across from where I was stocking, and talking to each other in Spanish. I’m really not paying much attention to them, when I thought I heard one of them say something like “She’s at the table, put it in the bag.”

I walk around the aisle, and one of the guys is holding a brick of firecrackers in one hand, and a large shopping bag from a different store in the other hand. I look in the other direction, and my cashier is at the front register checking someone out.

I walked up them smiling and said, “Bastardo barato, get out.”

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

kwinbot,83,181,1r7923,873,"Little backstory first: I was in a car accident in august, and even after insurance and taking care of everything, the woman driving the car I hit still bothers me. Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

CB: You said you would pay cash to get my car fixed

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I love fireworks. I got into the business because I love fireworks. I spend my vacation from my real job selling fireworks in a parking lot because I love fireworks (that, and it pays really well). I spend months researching fireworks, attending firework demos, and watching videos of new fireworks. Please don’t walk into my business and try to talk shit to me.

One of my employees grabbed me and asked me for some help. He had been showing a guy around the tent, and the guy was asking some questions that he couldn’t answer. He was apparently also kind of being a dick about it.

I walked up the to the guy and introduced myself.

**ME:** Andy told me you had some questions. Is there anything I can help you with?

**GUY:** Yeah, I was looking for some good stuff, but you guys don’t carry anything good.

Note to potential shoppers, if you’re looking to piss me off, this would be the way to do it.

**ME:** If you’re talking about legal fireworks, I carry some of the best stuff imported into the US. Is there something specific that you’re looking for?

**GUY:** I usually shop at &lt;other company&gt;, I just thought I’d stop by to see what you had, but their stuff is definitely better. I wanted to pick up some mortars, but I guess I’ll have to make the trip to the coast.

**ME:** Really? What mortar pack are you planning on getting?

**GUY:** I always get &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars. They’re definitely the best you can buy in the US. I'm not surprised that you don't have them, since you're just a tent.

**ME:** Wow, you have shitty taste in mortars, and those definitely AREN’T the best in the US. Hell, they’re not good enough for me to carry in my store.

**GUY:** You have no idea what you’re talking about.

**ME:** Really. &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars are imported by the Beihai Kylin Fireworks Co, located in the Guangxi province of China. Of course the fireworks are actually made in one of hundreds of factories located in Liuyang, a province of Hunan. It’s a 1 ¾ inch diameter 48 gram canister shell. Sadly, it only gets about 125 ft of lift out of the tube, because they skimped on the lift charge. 

**GUY:** But…

**ME:** The shells are also hand packed, rather than machine packed, which probably explains why the breaks aren’t symmetrical. That means it was made at an older factory. That’s probably why they sell them so cheap and will put any label you want on them. Then again, it’s only a 48 gram shell…and not even the best 48 gram shell that Beihai Kylin imports. 

**ME:** If that’s really the type of stuff you’re looking for, I probably won’t have anything you’d like. Thanks for stopping by.

I turned around and walked away from the guy.

He actually did end up shopping for a while, and picked up a lot of stuff from me. Sadly, he didn’t have any other questions for me.

However, I'm loaded with great customer stories. 

----

My current workplace, we're just generic retail, and deal a lot in pop culture. There are several clothing items and decoration-y things relating to different fandoms, movies, games, etc, but we also carry generic clothing items, sweatshirts, hoodies, pants. This story, is about pants. 

A few nights ago, got a kid (probably 11-12) and his mom in looking at some Doctor Who things, and he's decked out in buttons, keychain Tardis, and a Tardis shirt. I knew this kid and I would be friends, as an avid Whovian, so I walked over and told them about the sales, and asked him who his favorite doctor was. Bam, sales-win. 

Normally I try not to stay with a customer the whole time, because I don't want to be pushy, but this kid kept asking questions, so I kept answering. Ended up getting him in the dressing room to try on a shirt, after about 15 minutes. While we walked back in my tiny store to the one dressing room, his mom noticed the 'Wall of Pants' and exclaimed, 'MYGOODNESS, 26"" WAISTS!?'. She grabbed one, and brought them along with her. 

I love selling denim, it's eaaaaaaaaaasy. 

Ended up, she grabbed a pair of super duper skinny jeans, and the poor kid was like 'I can't, I can't feel my legs.' While I wandered off to find a pair of regular cut, she was telling her son to put his regular pants back on. I came back up, with two different styles and colors. Mom yells into fitting room 'TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF RIGHT NOW!' and I couldn't help but smile, and kind of laugh. 

I try not to have these reactions, often, although sometimes there are several moments during the day I could, and the mom caught me. I thought I was in trouble, based on the look on her face, but instead, she went on to embarrass her son a little more. 'BUT, IF ANY OTHER GIRL EVER TELLS YOU THAT, YOU PULL YOUR PANTS UP RIGHT THEN....'

I had to walk away,... because laughs.

I did end up coming back to them and she bought two pairs of jeans and several shirts, and even complimented me on my customer service. As they left, she stayed back and told me, 'I have to embarrass him as much as I can now. He's getting too old, too fast.' ","When Mom says, 'Take your pants off,' she means it.",948
JizzBeef,179,160,1qutuf,718,"Today at my gas station job a woman came in to get some cigarettes. Now we have a policy (and also it's kind of the law here) that if we think you look under 40, we need to see your ID. I know it may seem a little odd, but w/e, I do it cuz in the slim chance I sold alcohol or tobacco to a minor I'd be fired, fined, revoked of my liquor license,  and I think I'd see time in jail as well. So anyway, this lady looks like she's maybe 20 or 30, but I've seen people that look older but their ID shows a different story, so I ask her for her ID anyway. Our exchange goes like this:

Me: may I please see your ID?

Lady: I don't have it, but I'm over 18

Me: I can't sell you cigarettes without seeing your ID, it's against company policy

Lady: I know that! But I don't give a shit. My year of birth is 1986!

Me: lemme see that on your ID.

Lady: look, I told you I don't have it! This is bullshit... can't you just get somebody that works here everyday to confirm my age? I'm a regular here, I come in here like 3 times everyday for the past six months!

I turn to my manager, then I remember two things:

1. My manager is new, and he only works on the weekends

2. I work everyday, and this lady is just a fucking idiot.

So then I tell her, ""mam, I've worked here just about everyday for over a year now and I've never once seen you. I can't sell you cigarettes unless you show me your ID to confirm your age, I'm sorry, but it's also the law. I'm not willing to lose my job over you.""

The lady looks at me all pissy, and obviously embarassed as she has caused a line and everyone was dead silent listening to our conversation,  so she turns around sharply and yells ""fine! This is fucking bullshit but I'll be back with it!""

Meenite,99,205,1qw8oa,662,"Backstory:
I work in a small restaurant in the local mall and most days we open up at 10am (all stores/restaurants/etc follow the same time schedule) and since I'm just a cashier/waitress I show up about 9:45 am, change and get to work preparing the serving area and placing out the buffet items that can sit for a while without getting spoiled (pasta, salad, sauces, etc - in coolers/heaters/water-baths of course). The rest of the buffet is prepped and served at 11am (pizza, enchiladas, etc), sometimes a bit earlier. 

On this particular day I had just opened up the front doors and was placing out the display stands with todays lunch and special offers when a guy showed up and walked past me into the restaurant. I said Hi, which was ignored, he just continued. Ah well, everything was done at the entrance, so I went back to the cash register (its just to the right of the buffet) and waited for him to come over since he was busy with looking over the menu on the wall and the food serving area. He comes over almost immediately and he does not look happy.

""Where's the fucking buffet?!""

(What?) ""Well sir, the buffet opens at 11am, it says so on the sign hanging right above it, so its about 45 minutes left before it opens.""

""But I want the buffet right now! Why isn't it prepared yet? There's lot of people in the kitchen, cant they work faster?""

""As I explained, it opens in 45 minutes, if we put the pizzas out there now they might sit for over an hour before anyone shows up for lunch, and thats not particularly appetizing, is it? And some of the other food is not done yet. We want to serve them as fresh as possible at all times. But our whole menu is available and so is the rest of the lunch menu."" 

""But I want the buffet! It opens at 11am?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Well, I'll come back then but I want a discount!""

""What?""

""I want a discount on the buffet because you were unable to serve it to me when I wanted it.""

(Seriously?) ""I'm afraid I can not give you a discount on the buffet, sir, its already a price reduced offer and I can not make any form of discount on them, the cash register even denies it.""

""But I want a compensation for not getting my food! It is very rude to refuse a customer service! Is your boss here?""

""Sir, I am not refusing to serve you food, I am simply explaining that the food is not yet ready and that you are very welcome to come back in 30 or so minutes when its all done.""

GreenEyedDemon,107,177,1qtb0s,563,"I've been lurking here for a while, and decided to post a story from my minimum wage slave job. I'm a cashier at a gas station just off a highway that runs through my state, so I get assholes from all walks of life. From the man who's impatient because I'm not counting his $5.07 in pennies for cigarettes fast enough, to the woman who demands I pump her gas for her because it's a bit windy out. This story happened about a month ago.

It was myself and a new-ish guy alone for the 4-12 shift. This guy was new enough to require some supervision for certain things (money orders, prepaid cards, phone cards, etc.) but there long enough to be capable of being alone for five minutes while I do my chores. Well, I'm outside doing trash and there's a few people in line inside but not enough for me to have to run in. I'm happily picking up peoples refuse from the overfilled bins, when I hear a regular customer yell my name out the door and say ""Green, (new guy) needs you"". I drop my stuff and go in and there's about 3-4 people in line behind a guy wanting a pre-paid card specific to the gas brand we sell (rhymes with hell). These take a minute to do, so I ask him to wait and open my register and get all the other customers out the door. After, I motion him to my register and he asks for a $50 station card.

I grab one and I'm getting ready to activate it, but I tell him I need to see the cash before I activate the card (as is our store policy). He says ""I'm not paying cash, do it as credit"" and puts his credit card on the counter. Oh boy, I know where this is going.

Me: Sorry sir, but I can't use credit or debit cards for purchasing a prepaid card.

Him: Are you kidding me? I've done this hundreds of times at different stations.

Me: Sorry sir, our store policy is cash only for prepaid cards.

Him: This is bullshit! I've been waiting for fifteen fucking minutes (closer to five) and you won't sell it to me?! I'm going somewhere else, you lost my business!

Me: Sorry, have a nice day.

He leaves, and I'm telling my coworker (this was his first experience with a mean customer) to ignore the assholes, the regulars make it worth it. I look down and what else do I see but the douchebags credit card. I look out and see he's just now leaving his pump. Normally, I'd run out and give it to them, but oh no, it appears I need to hang this card back on the rack and by the time I've made sure it's nice and straight, he's left. It's a company card, so I know he'll be back.

Hours later, near the end of my shift he walks back in, looking much more sheepish than earlier.

Him: Hi, uh, I was in here earlier and tried to use my card to pay for a gift card, did I leave it here?

Me: Yes sir, you did. Here you go! (I hand it to him with a nice smile).

Him: Sorry about going off the handle about that, I know it's not in your power to change the policy. I'll be going, thank you for holding it.

Me: No problem, have a great day!

I've worked fast food for the better part of a decade now and make it a point to deliver the best customer service possible (and am frequently complimented by customers on that).

Working the cashier window, taking orders, taking money, generally going through the day like normal, when a customer hands me a Food Stamp card (they're called something else here, but I'll just refer to them as Food Stamp cards) to try to pay for their food. The total is hovering around $15-16.
In this state Food Stamp cards cannot be used for anything at restaurants, and our registers will flat-out decline the card if it's scanned. There is no way to circumvent that. I have the following exchange with the customer, whom I'll call Cheap-Ass Bitch (CAB).

&gt;Me- I'm sorry, we can't take that card.

&gt;CAB- *smugly* Oh? Why not?

&gt;Me- Food Stamp cards cannot be used to buy food that's prepared for you.

&gt;CAB- No, you can take it. I buy food here with it all the time!

&gt;Me- Ma'am, the register itself declines the card and I can't make it take it.

&gt;CAB- You CAN and you WILL!

(By this time, a sizeable line has formed in drive-through and I can hear people elsewhere in the store 
shouting back towards me that the line isn't move...as if I wasn't aware...)
&gt;Me- Ma'am, we legally cannot accept that card and have no way of using it. Do you have any other way to pay?

&gt;CAB- I AM THE CUSTOMER I PAY YOUR SALARY AND YOU WILL USE THE CARD!!!

(At this point, I'm fed up and have a rare moment where I start to snap)

&gt;Me- Ma'am, do you know how that Food Stamp card works?

&gt;CAB- YOU WILL RUN

&gt;Me- (Cutting her off) That Food Stamp card is funded by tax dollars. MY tax dollars. No. You're not ""Paying my salary"" by trying to use that card, since part of it is the money that I paid into the system through taxes. Now, please, do you have any other method of payment?

&gt;CAB- *taken aback at this uppity fast food drone standing up to her, and sputtering* Fine. Here. *thrusts a $20 at me*

&gt;Me- *takes it, cashes her out* Have a nice day.

tl;dr- If you plan on trying to commit Food Stamp fraud on someone who isn't having it, don't try to play the ""I PAY YOUR SALARY!"" card.

EDIT: Formatting derps. Forgot a word here or there.

EDIT THE SECOND: Just to be clear, I've got nothing against the Food Stamp program itself. It's a necessary program that helps feed so many families and keeps the economy afloat, especially in poor areas. People abusing the system, though, rustle my jimmies something awful though; and ones trying to abuse the system AND try to bully me into cooperating through twisted unlogic can get bent.","""I PAY YOUR SALARY!""...with my-tax-money-funded Food Stamps?",665
AAEmmerson,64,64,1r7jes,487,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about £4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

TL:DR Man wastes lots of grilled sandwiches, starts cussing us out, we get him thrown of his flight for aggressive behavior. All for a bacon sandwich.

HeloRising,41,71,1qvprn,396,"This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you. The last one took off so I figured I'd throw another one up.

***

I was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door. This wasn't strictly unusual, sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends. These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear, though, and all whiter than bleached snow. A little odd but this was in an *incredibly* white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall, it wasn't unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given day.

So 3Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces (a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes). I greeted them but they didn't take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes later.

""Yo...Yo man...you got like any frogs?"" 

""Frogs? Yeah we've got a couple of different ones, they should be up on that shelf"" 

""Naw dawg, I saw those ones. But I'm lookin' for somethin' special. Somethin' *gangsta*.""

I stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a ""gangsta"" frog looked like. I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker, thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the new(ish) guy. She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for *reals*, yo.

I told him to hold on and I'd check in the back. I went back where another employee was finishing up glazing.

""Hey...I don't know our whole stock yet. Do we have anything back here that we don't have out there?"" 

""A couple of things, why what'd they ask for?""

-long pause- ""A gangsta' frog.""

""....the fuck is a ""gangsta' frog?""

""I have no idea. Do we have anything that meets that criteria?""

""We've got one with a big chain, give him that.""

We did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to him.

""Yeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii! That's what I'm *talkin'* 'bout! 'Dat's the *shit* right there!""

So he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery. His cohorts also selected figurines, Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose. From listening to their back-and-forth, these were suitably gangsta' choices for various reasons.

As they were painting, my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song (they had, in fact, begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working with).

They took about an hour to finish their pieces. I wouldn't have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously. We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on *at length*, though I'm not positive how a springing lion can look ""straight outta Compton.""

Once they finished, they paid with credit cards (not as gangsta as a wad of cash but *way* easier for me to deal with) and left. Last I heard, they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap. To their credit, they weren't half bad at it.

Antics aside, they were actually very nice and never gave us any static. Never even heard the ""n"" word out of them (which was sadly very common with the hip-hop kids, especially the white kids).",They want gangsta' frogs.,467
Rubychan11,81,93,1qwqa2,389,"Short and so-not-sweet one here... I just got a call from one of my coworkers. She was in tears, her voice barely a whisper. Her mother had just recently gotten back surgery, so she had fresh stitches. Well, apparently the mother is very independent, doesn't like to admit she needs help, so she went to take a shower on her own. Biiiiig no no. The poor thing slipped and fell, opening the stitches and knocking her unconscious.

So of course, they take her to the ER. My coworker calls the manager and tells her what happened, saying please can she be excused from her shift--mind you, she's giving at least 4 or 5 hours' notice, and I would think this would be considered an emergency. Plus it's Monday... we are so not busy on Mondays. Surely they'll let her off, right......?

Nope. The manager says that if she doesn't come in, she'll get written up. So she calls me and asks if I could switch shifts with her (her 8 hour for my 4 hour) and of course I said yes, but I'm boiling mad at the manager.

Is that even allowed? Isn't there some sort of extenuating circumstance if a close family member is in the hospital? It's just like... what the fuck?!

AckAckADack,67,55,1qxzyy,364,"Long time reader first time posting. I devoted the better part of a decade to a company that sells guitars and thinks it's the center of the universe so my tale originates there. If you guys like, I'll put more up. Here goes. 

So one day whilst working a shift as the pro audio department manager, an attractive lady walks in and begins to look around. My slightly new co-worker K engages her and she's talking about she is interested in becoming a DJ. No problems there. K comes and asks me to assist him in closing the sale, not a problem. We get her into a very nice introductory setup - everything's cool. K begins ringing her up and announces the total - $1200. Lady doesn't even blink at the amount and pulls out a wad of cash. K looks at me with a bewildered look ""Ack, I've never seen that much cash before."" Me being used to dealing with large cash transactions, I just told him to make sure he counts it properly and drops it in the safe. He begins to count the money and is looking very nervous. I stand next to him and ask what's going on. ""Ummm Ack, this is a lot of cash."" I look at him then at the customer and immediately figure out why he's nervous. (In a lot of cases at our store, when folks pay large amounts of cash they tend to be involved in not so legal activities but money is money and as long as the sale gets made, I don't ask questions.) He's making the assumption that she's potentially a drug dealer. I begin to figure out ways to not make the situation any more tense when the customer speaks up and says ""Don't worry, it's not drug money, I'm a stripper."" I bust out laughing while K turns a very bright red. 

TL:DR Customer pays large amount of cash, it's assumed to be dope money when in fact it's stripper tips.",It's ok. I'm a stripper,419
Dhenn004,42,78,1qr32l,356,"I've posted here before, and I mentioned I was a Movie theater shift manager. And I apologize this may get long.

Anyways to the story. It's Friday night, and it's busy, Thor came out last week and Catching Fire is next week so pre orders and Thor are making it absolutely nuts. It's also bringing the worst out of my employees (rightfully so, they are stressed) and the customers.

Anyways I digress. At our concessions we offer a free refill for MEDIUM and LARGE drinks and popcorn. It's to beat our competitors because they only offer on Large. Now, typically people who come out with a small and want it refilled I offer to let them pay the difference from a small to a medium and switch their cup for them. It's like 50 cents and most people accept. Not Today, Not this customer.

So this man comes out and wants a refill. My assistant manager politely tells the man that she is sorry but only MEDIUMS and LARGES get refills. 

**asshole:** ""Well one of your employees said I get refills.""

**Assistant Manager:** "" I'm sorry but our policy states-""

**Asshole** ""What, I don't care about your policy I want a refill"" At this point I hear him raising his voice so I start to walk over. But he just throws his cup on the floor and walks away before I can try to defuse the problem.

I shout across the lobby "" Come on man! We work hard to keep this place clean!"" Basically to make him guilty. (if it were even possible). I pick my Assistant up with the ""he's an asshole"" speech and we figure its over with.

Jump about 10 to 15 minutes later. We get a complaint about a man in a theater being loud and talking. With the same description of the man we just dealt with. I sigh and go in and stand in the corner so I can assess the situation without him seeing me. (If I'm seen, most of the time people stop right away and don't make a noise). I hear him and see him talking in the corner. It's the asshole.

I make my rounds, I walk up both set of steps make it seem like I'm not there for him. I walk to his side and stop a couple of rows behind him. He's still talking. I walk up to him and whisper for him to please be quiet. He stops talking for, I don't know, no more than 30 seconds? I ask again. Nothing is working on this guy!

He continues and I once a gain tell him to be quiet with a firm voice. Also I include the I will have you escort you out if you don't keep quiet. He just laughs right in my face. So I tell him to leave immediately.

**asshole:** "" make me HAHAHAHA"" Now this is getting the attention of everyone in the theater. 

**Me:** "" I have no problem calling the police, sir""

**Asshole:** "" Go ahead I'm not doing anything wrong""

**Me:** "" yes you are, you are disturbing everyone's movie experience, I've done this before and the police will be on my side on this""

**Asshole:** "" yea okay whatever, bitch.""

 I radio up to my assistant who has been right behind the projector upstairs and tell her to pause the movie. I announce to the crowd saying I'm sorry for the disturbance but I need to stop the movie so they don't lose their experience and miss out on the movie. (The whole point of me doing this is to call him out, maybe embarrass him). Well it worked but not in the way I expected.

I stands up and I see him ball his fist and bucking up to me. Typically in a business situation you can't fight back or do anything. I wasn't looking to fight this man so I back up to put some space between this guy and myself. He starts moving towards me, and I quickly as possible Radio up and tell my assistant to call the city police department. (911 wasn't needed).

He lunges at me so I just back up as quickly as possible. I'm a pretty quick guy so I easily just moved out of the way. But he tried to get even closer and pushed me. After that it was on baby! Actually not really, he pushed me and I just grabbed him by the neck and held him in a position so that he couldn't do anything. 

I asked him if he was done but he was just getting furious. He tried dipping out before the police showed but I was prepared and had the doors locked so if something like this were to happen I could keep him in the theater. He ended up hiding in the bathroom until the cops showed up. Several police asked other movie goers what happened. Let me off with a pat on the back and said I did the only thing I could do to stop him and arrested him. 

TL/DR: I channeled my inner bruce lee and put him in a headlock.

works_in_a_pet_store,62,63,1qybg3,330,"ANTICLIMATIC UPDATE:

Well I got an email back this morning from our customer service rep telling me that the woman had called.  However, she is no longer in charge of customer service calls, and redirected the call to a brand new office.  I have not heard anything further about the situation.  We hadn't heard about it yet because it literally was being announced that afternoon during a conference call.  I asked my store manager to let me know if we got an email back from this new office, but there was nothing in the email today.  If I hear anything, I'll be back here with an update.

BACKGROUND:

As my username suggests I work in a pet store.  A corporately owned pet store, to give you a little more insight.  I'm a shift supervisor, and so I tend to close by myself and it then becomes my job to handle the majority of customer service issues.  



I'll also preface this story by explaining that our store has a new ""no complaints"" policy.  Corporate has been receiving too many customer calls that are complaints that corporate feels should have been handled at the store level.  The manager staff has been told that we are to do whatever it takes to keep a customer from calling corporate.    I could probably write a whole post about how I die a little bit inside each time I have to give a discount to somebody who in any other store would be told to hit the road. 



I'll also mention right now, if we weren't under this new ""no complaints"" policy, I would have asked her to shop elsewhere about 30 seconds into this whole ordeal.  Then again, I guess I wouldn't have this story if I had...

THE STORY


So I was doing my nightly rounds of the store, making sure everything looked nice and neat when I ran into Eighteen Dollar Lady (EDL for the rest of the story)... 

Me: Hi there, are you finding everything you need ton-

EDL: As a matter of fact, I've found what I needed, but I've got something to say to YOU. 

Me: Sure, what can I help you with? 

EDL: You can explain to me why this dog food is so damn expensive here.

------


I'll interject here quickly - she had a 12 lb bag of [Wellness Core Original Dog Food](https://www.google.com/search?q=wellness+core+orignial&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS527US527&amp;oq=wellness+core+orignial&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3211j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=93&amp;espv=210&amp;q=wellness+core+original&amp;tbm=shop).  This is a fairly high end food.  In our store it runs for about 35.98 dollars for that size bag.  The reason the price is so high is because they use high quality proteins in their food, and they use several other ingredients with higher nutritional value instead of a filler like corn.   I attempted to explain all of this to her, but I didn't get a word out...
_____

Me: Well it's a - 

EDL: (begins yelling out of nowhere) YOU KNOW, I NEVER COME HERE ANYWAY.  I ALWAYS SHOP AT ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location"".  THEY HAVE THIS FOOD FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS THERE.

*this is the where the broken record part of the story comes in...also my thoughts will be in italics...*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

HOW CAN THEY HAVE THE SAME SIZE BAG FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  HOW COME YOU ARE CHARGING SO MUCH.

*there's no way the other store charges that for this bag of food...our cost for it is around 25 or so bucks to begin with, and no store would sell it for below cost*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS....EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  


EIGHTEEN.


DOLLARS.

*is this really happening to me*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*oh god, make her stop*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*how many times has she said eighteen dollars now?*

YOU GUYS ARE SO.  GREEDY.  THIS IS CORPORATE GREED RIGHT HERE.  EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.


EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*ok, breath.  ok maybe I can offer her a price match.  yeah!  that's what she wants right?  yeah!  ok.  ok, I can still come out of this on top...  just got to wait for her to stop yelling.*

Me:  M'am I'm sorry to hear that, but do you perhaps have a reciept or an ad showing their price?  I don't set the prices here, but I can offer you a price match if you have - 

EDL:  WHO THE HELL CARRIES AROUND THEIR DOG FOOD RECIEPTS?

Me: Well, if you give me a moment, I can look up ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location""'s number and verify their price. 


EDL: NO.  I shouldn't have to go through all that just to get the right price!  IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  WHY ARE YOU SO GREEDY.

*what the...*

Me:  Again, I'd be happy to give you the food for that price, but in order to ring an actual price match on the register I need some sort of verification that the same product is that price at the other store...

*and that's pushing it, we're not really supposed to go below cost to make a bitch like you happy.*


EDL: NO, I WANT AN EXPLANATION.  I WANT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR FOOD IS 36 DOLLARS AND THEIR FOOD IS 18 DOLLARS.

*Wow.  Fuck you lady.  I'm trying to help you here...*

Me:  Well, as I mentioned before, this is fairly high end food.  They use a lot of high quality ingredients, so it's more expensive to make.  But you are getting a very good quality food for the money.

EDL:  NO. THIS FOOD ISN'T THAT GOOD.  IT'S NOT HIGH END IF IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AT THE OTHER STORE.  DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

*SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Don't call me a liar.  If you want your damn food for 18 dollars, go to the other damn store. Please, just swear at me so I can kick you out...*

EDL:  WHO DO I HAVE TO CALL TO GET THIS ANSWERED.  WHO?

Me:  Well, I'm a shift supervisor, so if you'd like, the next point of contact is my manager who will be in tomorrow...

EDL: NO.  I WANT SOMEBODY HIGHER UP.

*Crap.  We're not supposed to let them call corporate until we've done everything at the store level to keep them happy.*

Me: Well, I'll tell you what.  I think I can scrape together a few store coupons to take about 15 dollars off your bag .

*I died a little bit inside saying this, by the way.*

Me:  Would that be ok with you?

EDL:  NO.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT A DISCOUNT.  I JUST WANT A NUMBER TO CALL.  YOU CORPORATE BIG BOX PET STORES ARE SO GREEDY.

*side note, I don't work for either of the two stores that probably come to mind when I say big box store.  It's a corporate store, yeah, but we've only got about 150-200 stores total. We're actually cheaper compared to the other two big pet stores that probably come to mind*

Me:  M'am, I don't set the prices.  I can give you a number for our customer service representative, and I can give you some coupons to bring the price down a lot more than I quite honestly should.  

EDL:  NO.  I WANT WHOEVER SETS THE PRICES.

*Fucking seriously?  Nope.  She's not getting anything other than our CS rep.*

EDL: M'am I don't have that information, I can give you the number for our customer service rep, and if she's not able to help you out, then she will give you the number of somebody higher up.  

EDL: Fine.  



We get up to the register.  I find a few store coupon PLUs that we have to use in situations like this.  It's meant to be a last resort, that maybe, just maybe if a customer sees the price come down that much, they won't call corporate.   

Even though I know she's going to call corporate anyway,  I still give her the coupons off,  I think because all that will happen if I don't do it, is corporate will fucking send her a $25.00 gift card ""for her troubles"".  Because to them, she's one more customer that will spend money in our store, so let's give her 25 bucks now to keep her coming back...all about that bottom line for them.


She finished her transaction and left the store. 


Knowing that she's going to call corporate, I now had to write an email to the customer service rep, detailing the whole incident.  


And then I had an idea.


I pulled out the yellow pages.

I looked up that privately owned pet shop that was about 20 minutes away from us.


I called them from my cell phone, pretending to be a customer.


 
Asked them if they had Wellness Core Original in the 12 lb bag, and what the price was if they did.
 
The guy came back on the phone after checking. They do not carry a 12 lb bag at all of that brand.  They carry the largest size 25 lb.  It's 55.99.

Our price on our 25 lb bag is 52.98.  We're cheaper than them.  WE'RE CHEAPER THAN THEM.  I pretty much was dancing at that point. 



I won't know how everything went down on the corporate end of things until tomorrow.  I'm praying and praying that they tell her to shove it,  because I REAAAAAALLLY wanted to.  And I'm hoping that maybe this particular nutcase makes them rethink their ""no complaints"" policy...

yohtin,39,67,1r052q,310,"I used to work at a hotel as a night auditor (overnight front desk guy). It was mostly pretty safe, but every now and again a homeless person would sneak into the building and try to sleep or steal food from the breakfast room. I quit and got a new job for a lot of reasons, mostly related to the fact that my manager was a terrible human being. This was the straw on the camel's back, though. 

One night I was delivering muffins to the breakfast room and was going to make coffee. At about 4am I found and confronted a homeless guy and asked him if he was a guest. He said ""I'm tired of people asking me that question"" and unsheathed a big knife. I dropped the muffins, ran downstairs and called the police. They showed up right away and he was already gone, but had stolen a bunch of the muffins. We had security cameras so I gave them a description of the guy and my manager's number so she could send them the footage.

A few days later, my manager called me into her office, and before asking me if I was ok, she passive-aggresively showed me the security footage of the homeless guy stealing the muffins. She said that she understood why I ran away but I should have taken the muffins with me, because now they were going to be short on muffins for the week. I acknowledge I could have picked the muffins back up and ran with them back downstairs, but not getting stabbed kind of took precedent at that moment.

So, yeah, the moment I realized my manager gave more of a shit about breakfast muffins than whether or not I got stabbed was a big reason I quit. I have a new job (day job) and am way happier now, good riddance to that place!",Breakfast muffins vs. me getting stabbed. Hmmmm yeah not really a choice at all...,377

Now I could have snapped at her etc. But I just calmly reply "" I'm sorry ma'am but I'm deaf. If I'm not looking at you I can't hear you""

She immediately apologized and I said it was okay. Found out she told both the kid and the tech to apologize again for her",Petty but I felt better,369
VoicesDontStop,32,65,1qwlwh,303,"Okay so I'm not employed but I think this story belongs here.

A little back story I'm 17 looking for a job. my mom is one of those people on this subreddit that you guys dont like ( yelling at people for small thing, not understanding clearly stated rules to sales,coupons, etc.) its kind of embarrassing shopping with her. 

-

So I'm with my mom at this little outlet Verizon store trying to see if we can get some internet for our apartment. The guy helping us out was nice enough, helpful and explained everything pretty well. He set us up with a internet package with DSL internet and a TV package. 

So Verizon has to send us a modem through UPS, as it turns out Verizon gave UPS the wrong address (to our last residence, don't really know how they got that) so my mom gets PISSED so to calm her down I tell her I'll call UPS and fix it. 

So I'm talking to a UPS rep trying to get everything fixed and I do but mom asks me to hand over the phone so she can talk to them, me not thinking about it hands her the phone.

Mom: yes hello are with UPS?

UPS lady says something, I assume she says ""yes""

Mom: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!? I""VE BEEN WAITING ALMOST WEEK FOR THAT! YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE TO BILL ME BUT YOU CANT BRING ME MY BOX?!

I'm just there speechless as to why she is yelling at this poor woman.

Me: MOM! 

Mom: WHAT VoicesDontStop?

Me: they aren't the internet company, they're just the delivery company it's not their fault. Verizon gave them the wrong address.

Mom:......... hello? yes I'm sorry for that, here talk to my son.

I take the phone.

Me: Hello?

UPS Woman: Yes will that be all you were trying to fix?

Me: um, yeah.... sorry about that ma'ma.

UPS Woman: No I'm sorry.

Me: what? what do you mean?

UPS Woman: You have to live with her.

after that I hang up laugh to myself and go on with my day. A couple days later my bro told me about how she went down to the Verizon store and made a scene yelling at the Verizon guy who helped us get the internet package.

((EDIT: to the UPS and Verizon guy if you're on reddit, again I'm sorry.))

Frenchington,74,54,1r4g7b,304,"You know how you ""normal"" people out there seem to put your carts away in the designated areas? It makes sense doesn't it?
Well not this guy, nope, that's no fun. 
So as I am making my rounds, collecting the grocery carts to return to the store, my eyes lock with this man. He is probably in his early twenties or late teens, and he is rolling his cart to a depositing area across the lot. We maintain eye contact and the biggest grin cracks across his face. He proceeds to do a strange running-180-degree-turn-type-thing, and then pushes the cart down to the end of the lot.

We're not talking a half-hearted measly old man push here, this cart makes distance across the abandoned parking and slams into the planter on the opposite side of the lot.

I was so confused, and angry, that the only way I managed to express my frustration with this experience was through shitty Microsoft Paint drawings.

RachelmElizabeth,37,71,1qs9et,296,"This is my second post on here and let me just say i've fallen in love with this subreddit because I now know i'm not alone with all the crazy customers.

This happened when I was working at clothing store that buys gently used teenage clothing (sounds like plates in spanish). I was about 30 minutes into my shift and this lady was running around with a friend and i'm assuming her daughter. They were really strange but I shrug that off because I had seen worse.

Well when it came time for them to checkout they had quite a few items. I'm ringing them up, making sure I don't leave any security tags on, then making a pile so I can put them in a bag. She starts getting really impatient with me even though i'm going as fast as a I can and says (we'll call her CL for crazy lady):

CL: ""You don't have to fold them, just shove them in a bag and hurry up.""

ME:""I'm sorry mam, i'm checking for security tags.""

CL:""Well you need to hurry up because I need to change my bandage. I got a foot of my intestines cut out and I shouldn't have been standing this long. Let me show you my bandage.""

Before I could tell her I was not interested in seeing it since I just ate lunch, This bitch pulls up her shirt and low and behold a huge clear bandage with her intestines protruding out of it. I don't get queasy easily but all I could think is if that bandage comes off all her insides are going to pour out like an episode of The Walking Dead and i'd have to be the one to clean it up.

TL/DR: Pushy lady rushed me because her intestines were falling out.

GrimGuy,58,60,1qsw32,274,"The scene is a movie/game rental store in the final days before their downhill slide. This particular store is a fairly busy one, but it's a weekday afternoon and the place is nearly empty. I've been ""borrowed"" from another store for the day and, having just finished my shift, am lingering while I shoot the shit with coworkers.

Enter a child and his mother of non-assuming appearance and demeanor, their appearance and demeanor non-assuming enough that I forgot about them nearly immediately. Minutes pass, I putz around in indecision over which crappy movie to use my daily free rental on, and the mother/child come around to our games. 

Now, we primarily rented movies and games, but we did sell some as well. Invariably, the games we sold were ancient shovelware and sports games half a decade past their day; all of them were without instructions or original cases, all of them were scratched to hell. They were also all ludicrously overpriced, running damn near what a new game might.

For whatever reason, the child decides he has to have some baseball game. He's been quiet so far, but he's found his muse in the form of a brightly colored plastic box with one of our generic store inserts serving as cover art, and ""Baseball 2001"" written half-assedly on it in Sharpie. ""Baseball 2001"" could be one of a couple games, but the kid wasn't concerned with quibbling details. 
His mother, either due to wisdom or disinterest, wasn't having any of it. The first couple polite refusals weren't taken well, and soon the kid is pulling out the arsenal. He tried to bargain, he tried to plead, and the crying didn't come long after. 
Hoping to soothe him, she let him carry it while they continued their rounds. This only led to him using it to smack her on the leg and continue to ramp up his growing tantrum. Her refusals became more firm as time went on and things escalated steadily. 

By the time he threw himself to the floor in full tantrum, the scene had garnered the attention of my coworkers and I. It was nothing alarming, and there was an almost refreshing quality to the mother not breaking down in the face of a crying kid. When his tantrum began, she earned a bit more of our respect by taking the game from him and stating very clearly:
""I'm not buying you this game today. We can talk to your father tonight - but if you keep this up, I'm going to write down the game's name and tell him about it so neither of us EVER buys it for you for your WHOLE LIFE.""
My coworkers and I all had a look I can best describe as that Obama ""Not Bad"" face as we nodded to each other, assuming the matter was closed.

Not so.

The child, face red and tear-streaked, stopped making much noise. This wasn't because he was soothed or stopped, but because he'd turned into a white-hot ball of seething rage, his senses failing as his world collapsed around him.  
He started making noise, eventually, in an unconscious sort of way. It was this half-asthmatic, cat-in-heat, moaning sort of sound that belonged in a Lovecraft novel. It never got very loud, but his actions spoke volumes.

Promptly, he dropped his pants and took a splashing, chunky, yellow shit all over the floor. 


My curiosity about how this would end collided with my minimum-wage survival instinct, and I got the hell out of Dodge in short order. I'm told she cleaned it up, in tears, while the child went back to asking if he could have the game.

blackaurora,18,45,1r5trc,253,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I’d much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being “backing”). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That’s why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it’s a land yacht. It’s being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it’s a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she’s going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don’t get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

“Hey, you!” She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don’t register that she’s talking to me.

“Hey, cart guy!” She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

“Do you ned help unloading?” I ask.

“No. I want to know why you dented my car.”

“I’m sorry?”

“You dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it”

“I was working on the other side of the lot. I haven’t been in this area for a while.”

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. “You left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?”

Ugh. “I’ll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.”

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

“You have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.”

“I wasn’t anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.”

“She says you did.”

“How? I’m not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.”

“Look. Be careful. I don’t want this happening again.”

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.”

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it’s bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

“You just totaled a $60,000 car!”

Now, I did not handle this well.

“YOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.”

Second rule of retail: “It’s your fault.” It should not be, but it is.

“I want to talk to a manager right now!”

Yuppie-Husband parks his “totaled” car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: “This kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?”

Side note: “Totaled” is short for “total loss” This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

“Lets discuss it in my office.” Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was “my turn.”

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don’t have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for “causing” and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband’s fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

genericname11,27,35,1r72se,238,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.



Lesson? If someone is supposed to come help you, don't freaking walk away so they can't find you.

I was working in the store for about a month and a half when my boss started giving me the low-down about Catholicism and how it belongs in a ""Christian"" store. The thing was, I am an Atheist so you can see were the problems will arise.

Dr_Kelvin,50,47,1qxl83,221,"When I was in Highschool in Australia, I worked at a photo processing store across from a Supermarket. It was a reasonably up market processing chain, so the prices were a little higher than some of the other chains around the area, for example the processing cost for 36 photos was around $15 or $11 with a coupon from the Supermarket. 

One night a lady came in to pick up her photos, I quoted her the standard price of $15, she looked at me and said “I am not paying that”, cue an awkward silence before I reply “Well that is the price”. She again says “I am not paying that much, that is way too much for a roll of film”, to attempt to avoid any more arguments in front of the customers behind her I said “Ok Ma’am, no problems, I will be happy to ring you up for the coupon price of $11 then”. I started to ring it up for the discounted price and she stops me and says “No, I will not pay $11 either; I will only pay $9 for that roll of film because that is how much it should be.” I am generally pretty calm, but for some reason her attitude that night pushed me over the edge, so I held up her photos, pointed at the supermarket across from the store and said “Ma’am, I don’t know how you think this works but you cannot just come into a store and tell them how much you’re willing to pay for something. Do you walk into the supermarket pick up a steak and tell them how much you’re going to pay? No, you don’t, you pay the amount that is listed on the product. I don’t know why you think because we print photos the rules have changed, but they haven’t.” I threw her photos back into the drawer where we kept the prints that were ready to be picked up and continued “I am not sure why you think you can name your price, but I am more than happy to hold onto your cherished memories until you are ready to pay the full $15 as you do not have a coupon, if you’re aren’t ready to pay that they will be thrown out in 30 days as per store policy.” As I finished my rant her eyes were pretty wide and before she could reply my Manager ran up behind me and told me to go on break. 


I later found out he only charged her $9 for the photos and I also got written up with an official warning for poor customer service.

""Ok then, sir. I'll still forward your complaint to the company. Thanks for bringing the issue to our attention.""

""When will I see the points on my account?""

In a saccharine tone of voice - ""Oh, no, you said that the points weren't worth it, so I've voided the credit. If you want to take the matter further, you can write to the address on the back of the receipt. Have a lovely afternoon!""

groundciv,26,46,1r4jqn,209,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

themonkeyone,33,39,1r7frc,212,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

SenorPierre,25,44,1r0aps,193,"what's up, Tales From Retail. I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

manager ""oh, okay then. have a good day, SenorPierre.""

chrilo,40,67,1qqbev,188,"Okay, some background first. The currency in Norway is crowns and cents (not really cents, but lets call it that for simplicity). When you buy a soda, or other kinds of soft drinks, you pay an extra 1 crown for the bottle if it's 0,5l, and an extra 2 crowns 50 cents if it's a larger bottle, this is known as pant. You get this money back when you return it, it's to make people recycle or something.

Now, a couple years ago, Norway removed cents (as in the physical coins, prices are still set to 1.49, 3.68, etc.) from it's currency system (1 US dollar equals about 6 crowns these days, so you can imagine how little it was worth), so if your total comes to 3 crowns and 0-49 cents, it's rounded down to 3 crowns, and up if it's 50-99 cents.

Finally, the real story. Now let me just tell you, I have seen some cheapskates in my day. I've had people yell me an earful because an item had the wrong price-tag, and people who would rip me a new one because a sale ended the day before. I've had customers that literally went to 5 different stores to get their shopping done, just so that they could take advantage of every sale they could find, but NOTHING beats this woman! 

This lady comes up to my register and hand me a check from the pant-machine. It's for 2 crowns and 50 cents, I scan it, press enter and lo behold, she gets her 3 crowns. Fairly uneventful. The she gives me another. And another. AND ANOTHER. Turns out she has 10 of these, that she wants in cash, one at a time, so that she can get an extra 50 cents for each. She should have gotten 25 crowns, she got 30. And after that she has the AUDACITY to ask me to change it for her, 'cause she ""doesn't want all this loose change"".

She basically did this to ""save"" 5 crowns, ALMOST 1 US dollar (I use the term lightly, swindle is really a more appropriate word). I was about ready to rip her throat out, unfortunately, my boss wouldn't let me...",So I had a run-in with the biggest cheapskate I have ever met today...,255

Okay, so I was a host at the cajun place, and the way the management worked, there was a manager for each section of the restaurant workforce (a manager for the kitchen, manager for the servers, a host manager,  blah blah) and my manager (lets call her BA for big ass) was a worldclass bitch.

One day, I hear BA talking quietly in the back  with another manager and just happen to catch her convo. BA: ""She just wants attention, I mean how else can she get it other than faking an injury? I mean how long is she gonna wear that stupid brace?!"" The other manager could see me, and obviously didn't agree becuase she didn't say anything.

One day when I was a receptionist, a woman came in looking for directions. She had just moved to town and wanted to learn about the area. She was also trying to find a local historic school house her grandmother had attend in the early 1900's. We ended up chatting over this and where she was from for about a half an hour (it was a pretty slow job..) and she brought up that she was adopting a cat later that day. We talked more about that and had a really wonderful conversation. As she went to leave she stopped and turned back around.


""What is your name?"", She asked.


""The name's Herpsen!"" (It's pretty close)


""Herpsen. You are truly a remarkable young man,"" She said, ""right down to your name! Not a lot of people want to hold a long conversation with a loony old woman like me.""


Whoa. I was blown away by that.


""You seem like a very kind person which is so rare in people your age. And you have helped me more than you know today. I see you being an absolutely wonderful man!"" She continued.


""Well thank you very much."" I was really touched. ""This is such a professional place, it's a treat to get someone that's actually personable!""


She looked at me like she knew about a fountain of youth and was debating telling me. ""May I name my new cat after you?"", she blurted out.


SAYYYY WHAAAA??? ""Absolutely!"", I didn't even hesitate, ""If you think he can handle the pressure of such greatness!"" I said with a humble giggle.


She gave me the biggest, most heart warming, most genuine smile I have ever gotten. As she walked back to the door and said her good-byes, she said, ""Your legacy will live on!""


I stared out the door after her with complete shock. I thought about my ""legacy"".. Smoking lots of pot, trying very little in school, disappointing my parents, failing out of community college, getting arrested, stealing, and 9 years of therapy was what I immediately thought of.. But then I felt a warmth in my chest. She was right. I do have a big heart. I care!


So from then on that will be my legacy! 


It was just so beautiful!

insecure_shit_knob,30,40,1r2plz,171,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

WishfulOne,29,26,1qv8pl,165,"I used to work with an older lady (she was 70+) whom I'll call Bee.  Bee had been working in retail a long time and was hired by our store when the company she had been working for closed down.  Bee was very set in her ways, insisted things should be done the way they were at her old store and could try the patience of the calmest saint but was also very kind and hard working.  

Bee really wanted the position of department head, the position she held in her previous store, and tried to get it several times.  She was continually turned down because she had never learned how to use the telxon (a device like a hand held computer that stores can use to order, do price changes, check what's on-hand etc.) and didn't think she should have to.  One day one of the managers caves and tells her she can have the position temporarily while one of the heads is on medical leave.  I'm given the task of teaching her to use the telxon.

Teaching her the telxon is an exercise in futility. She's just not getting it.  Part of me understands because this technology is all new to her and pat of me is screaming in frustration because I've explained it a dozen times already, wrote out step by step instructions and she still doesn't get it.

Bee: ""My telxon isn't working.  I don't know what's wrong with it."" She gives it a shake.

The place had yam fries, which were served with a small plastic container of chipotle dip. One day, a guy who worked in the mall ordered said fries and dip. He was nice enough, and left to go eat his food at work.

""Uh, sorry?"" I replied.  
""What is this?""  
""Uh...?""

* **Friday Guy**

Every Friday, around 10 to 5 minutes before close, a man in what I would guess is his early 40s would arrive, ordering the same thing every time: A cheeseburger and large fries, a large coke (which must be bagged), 4 packs of ketchup, 6 packets of salt, and 6 packets of vinegar. He always paid with a 20 and always required that his change be entirely in loonies ($1 for those outside of Canada). He would always exchange some of his spare change fore a quarter, and would always throw out his plastic bag in exchange for a new one. The most annoying part was he was very talkative. He followed every sentence with ""Okay?"" and expected you to reply, or else he would just keep asking. 

Upon leaving, he had to tell us that he would be back next Friday at the same time, and the Friday after that as well, as well as saying thank you and goodbye several times, and if you didn't respond he would continue saying it until you did. Apparently he would also come in the following Saturday to tell us he'd be there the following Friday, though I never witnessed it. He had been doing this for 5 years before I started, and never missed a day, except once, at which point he got angry and began banging on the counter because we were closed.

It's obvious he has severe OCD, so I can't really be mad at him or anything, but it was REALLY annoying, especially after a busy day.

Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

xVarekai,78,32,1r3e2x,155,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

meguriau,17,22,1r5sy8,151,"Hi TFR, I’m back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It’s been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn’t have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I’m sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That’s preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I’m afraid that’s the most I can do for you at this point in time. We’ll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN’T BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN’T GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN’T DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I’m terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you’d left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN’T CALL. 

**M:** I’m sorry to hear of your husband’s ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let’s just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don’t need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that’s retail!

Locclo,70,35,1qssv1,141,"**Background**: I work in the bakery department of a big retailer. My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor, and occasionally taking a cake order (or handing one over to a customer).

So, today I found out about something new that my store is doing, and I'm pretty bummed out about it. Where I work, the scheduling system gives a lot of freedom and control to the employees. Scheduling is automated, and it's based on what you put in for your availability, meaning that if you ask not to come in until 3 PM, the computer won't - and in most circumstances, can't - schedule you until 3 PM. What's more, managers can't change the schedule on a whim, they need your login and password in order to do it (and that's one piece of info they don't have).

What's all this got to do with anything? Well, for the first time since I've started, and probably as a result of Target infamously opening on Thanksgiving last year, the computer is allowed to schedule people completely outside of their availability for one week. Take a wild guess as to which one. 

Thankfully, the manager I spoke to said that he'd be able to tweak my schedule ever so slightly so that I can actually go to class on the Monday before Thanksgiving, since my school only closes on that Thursday, but sadly, for the first time in 22 years, I'm going to miss out on my family's big Thanksgiving dinner, because I have to work from 11 AM to 8 PM on that day, and dinner's right around 4-5. I even have to skip class on Black Friday, because my manager told me flat-out that I could not change my hours for that day. (Edit: to clarify, he did flat-out tell me that I wasn't going to be able to change my hours on Friday, but after reading some of these comments and considering my options, I'm definitely going to at least leave early on Friday to go to class)

I don't think I've ever contemplated calling in sick on a day that I know will be busy, but this news has me pretty tempted to do it on the 28th out of spite.

TL;DR: For one week out of the year, the world stops to stare at my store, and any employee who says otherwise might just be out of a job.

Edit: For the record, the store is open for 24 hours, and the only day they close is Christmas Day; the only change in policy here is that the computer is being allowed to schedule people outside of their availability, and said people are not allowed to change their hours on Thanksgiving/Black Friday.","A New Store Policy, or Why This is My Last Year",176

It was a typical day in the neighborhood, a typical day for cosmetics. Daisy was working her counter, when this kid, about thirteen or fourteen, ran past her, grinning. One of the security guys, Rosco, showed up, looking around. Daisy knew what was what and pointed where the kid had gone. A short while later, she's doing a bit of tidying, cleaning the front of her displays.

As she's bent over, she feels her skirt moving, followed immediately by an excruciating pain in her arse. ""That's what you get for snitching!"" The boy from earlier had just stabbed her in the ass by ramming three pencils into her soft flesh. He had pretty good aim. They were all right around her rectum. They were, unfortunately, cedar pencils. Daisy was and is allergic to cedar.

Her brain started to get muddled. She turned and slapped him so hard he fell down. Rosco showed up about the time she was starting to to get sick. She couldn't walk, but she had tears streaming down her cheeks.

She was gripping him by the collar of his shirt and hanging on for dear life. Her manager, Boss Hogg, was called, as well as her brother, Bo. They called an ambulance, and the EMT had to cut the boy's shirt to get him free.

Good thing they did, because she was having convulsions and shaking him violently. The kid was yelling ""GET THIS CRAZY BITCH OFF ME!"" Boss Hogg called the police, and decided to press charges. A few days later, Daisy was back to work. She needed a cane, and could not sit down, due to three sore, golf ball sizes swellings. She had to have a [very special pillow] ( http://www.hemroidharry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/donut-cushion-from-duro-med.DMI102.1.185.jpg) to sit on. Boss Hogg bought the pillow for her. She was and is one of his best workers.

A few days after she got back, guess who she saw! As the boy ran past, he said, ""bitch!"" She grabbed him by the back of his collar and yanked him off his feet. She let go and let him hit the floor hard. Homeboy was down and out.

Ambulance was called. Kid had a concussion. It was finally decided that he had ignored some wet floor signs. That was the last they ever saw of homeboy. Daisy got a verbal warning and told she was lucky no customers had been around.

spotty82,18,28,1r43bb,138,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

TennisAndBeer,4,30,1r63y6,139,"So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate, yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores. As a result, the store, parking lot, and even surrounding roads are always filled and busy.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues. 

When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous, technically she's in another department, but she's been there like 20 years so I'm sure she could have me fired. However, she was actually very mature about the whole thing. She apologized again and thanked me for the warning, saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadn't realized it.

blarglznoflo,28,41,1qqwj5,137,"A few weeks ago or so, my store had a brand of vitamins/supplements on sale as buy one/get one free. Simple, right?

The brand has tons of coupons. There are almost always those little folded-up coupons stuck to the top of the bottles. I mean, it's a decently expensive brand of vitamins, so people really appreciate getting a buck or two off of their $16 vitamins (although we sell the same thing in much cheaper brands, but whatever...).

Well, I had a customer come through and, in addition to his groceries, he had two bottles of these vitamins. First, I had to explain to him that they had to be the same price for the BOGO, but he accepted that easily enough and we had a clerk grab a replacement bottle so the BOGO would work.

I put it through just fine, he paid like $11 for one and the second was free.

He then hands me all his grocery coupons, and eventually I notice several coupons for these vitamins. I point out to him that we're only allowed to use one vendor coupon on each item, so I would only be able to use one of his ""$1.50 off a bottle of Vitamin Brand"" coupons.

He freaked the heck out. 

Customer: ""No! I paid $11 for TWO BOTTLES, so I need to get all $3 off!"" (the amount it would be with the two coupons, in case that wasn't obvious)

Me: ""But sir, because of the sale, technically you only paid for one bottle. We sold you the second bottle at zero dollars, and we can't take $1.50 out of zero. The computer simply will not let me.""

I turned my screen around so he could see the error message that popped up when I scanned the second coupon. It was something like ""no applicable item"" because, well, one coupon had been applied to bottle 1, and bottle 2 wasn't eligible.

Of course, he gave my favorite outcry of ""let me talk to a manager about this!""

I called over a manager, knowing that I had done it correctly. We face this issue EVERY...TIME we have this sale. But he kept repeating what is now my least favorite phrase, and I do not understand how every problem customer is convinced of this delusion...

Customer: ""I did this just last week!""

Manager: ""Sir, we don't allow that on BOGO sales. And these weren't on that sale last week.""

Customer: ""Well, it was last time, whatever. And (name of another manager) let me do it.""

Manager: ""No, sir, she wouldn't have because this is part of our company policy, we've discussed this issue about this sale.""

Customer: ""Well, I did it last week!""

Manager: ""And you won't be able to do it today. Do you want the two bottles for $9.50, or not?""

Customer: ""Not if you won't let me use coupons like EVERY OTHER STORE!""

Manager: ""Ok then, sir!""

She removed the coupon and took the vitamins back to put them away.

These vitamins are usually $15+ at regular price. We have them on sale, PLUS buy one/get one free, PLUS using a coupon...so getting about $30 of vitamins for $9.50 wasn't good enough for him?","No, you can't get $1.50 off a free product.",178
Lightfairy,25,40,1qz14s,134,"I work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city. I have posted other stories (Go search! Still haven't worked out how to link stuff!). I get to deal with all sorts of weird and wonderful people and with fetishes that I had no idea existed (google is my friend) but the ones that I do bend over backwards for (get your minds out of the gutter people!!) are the people who come in seeking advice/help due to medical conditions. Life really hands you lemons when you lose your sex life due to accidents or other causes. I worked for a while as a carer for disabled/elderly/sick/dying people. In that job I provided personal care such as assisting with showering/bathing/dressing and all aspects of assistance needed for a person to maintain their lifestyle and their dignity. I try to carry some of that over to my job. I really have seen it all!

Todays tale. A gentleman of around 45 comes into the shop. He makes some inquiries about our range of strap-ons. I go through the different models and show him the various features. He also asks a few questions about other 'toys' that will help him give his wife pleasure. He starts getting chatty and tells me he has had some surgeries and as a result of his medical issues has been left heavily scarred and is impotent. He still wants a happy wife, hence the reason for his visit. He continues detailing his various surgeries for me and then out of the blue says,

'And this is the result' and promptly drops his trousers!

There is this man standing in front of me with his pants at his knees (he had no underwear on), pointing to his limp member. 

'It's dead! Bloody useless thing! Never to rise no more!' 

He points to the scars. 

'And look at this! Bloody road map over my stomach and abdomen! Ugly as fuck!' 

He gesticulates wildly at his nether regions.

I peer down and say, 'I can see what you mean but it really doesn't look all that bad based on the surgeries you just detailed to me. I have seen far worse.'

He pulls his pants up 'Really?' 

'Yes sir' say I 'it sounds like you are lucky to be still alive.'

'Yes I suppose I am' he says  'and my wife still loves me and I love her.'

'I think you are a pretty lucky guy then.' 

He smiled.

Went on to spend about $300. To me it wasn't really the money. It shows that adult shops serve another purpose. We are not just there for shits and giggles. We actually help make people happy, keep relationships together and keep that sexual energy flowing. 

TL;DR Richard Gere came into the shop. Didn't have a gerbil! No really, read the story!

albinosquirel,24,21,1r6unw,130,"Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.


I felt like a champion.


I left the door propped open so the bathroom would air out.

RenM,60,21,1qwc0g,118,"So I used to work as a pharmacy technician which means I both handled prescriptions and rang up everyday shopping items for customers. It was a combo hell. Here are some of the stories:

1. We had a regular that was HIV positive, super nice, but also a bit mentally disabled. His mother often brought him to the store or just picked up his meds for him. However, one day he came in without her and we exchanged our normal pleasantries. He said he needed a refill, I said I needed a new prescription, he pulls it out of his wallet and I see that his finger is bleeding (it looked like a paper cut). He take out his prescription with said bleeding finger, and attempts to hand it to me. Normally policy is to hold a customer until you are done running the script incase insurance feels like making the job extra awful. Instead I say while typing, ""Oh no, [name]. It looks like you cut yourself. Just put the script on the counter and here take a bandage (which I don't hand to him but instead place on the counter, normally rude but...). We'll call you when the script is ready."" He just smiles, says thanks, puts on the bandaid, and walks away. I smile until he disappears behind an aisle and then tell the pharmacist what just happened. In the end we cleaned it up and my manager actually called his mom. His mom apologized. She was sick and he wanted to run errands on his own. I guess she explained to him that he can't bleed on public things b/c he apologized profusely the next time he came in with her. 

2. Our duties board is posted in a place that customers can see it. This means if they feel like being creepy they can tell when you start work, get off work, or take a lunch break. I had one older gentleman look at my name tag, then at the board, and then he said, ""I'll be waiting for you at 9pm."" Then he winked and walked away. The assistant manager walked me to my car that night.

3. Another older gentleman came to pick up his viagra. That stuff is expensive so most men only get a few pills at a time and refill as necessary. This man said, ""My wife and I don't do it that often anymore. Maybe one of these pills has your name on it?"" Me: ""No, I'm pretty sure they just say 'Pfizer' on one side and 'VGR 100' on the other. Sorry."" Then I walked away. 

4. I lady comes up to buy a behind-the-counter cold medicine. 
Me: ""Can I see your drivers license please?"" 
Lady: ""No."" 
Me: Kind of caught off guard. ""Um...I need it to sell you the medicine."" 
Lady: ""Why?"" 
Me: ""State law."" 
Lady: ""Why"" (She was well into her 40's so I'm not sure why she was mimicking a toddler).
Me: ""Because some of the ingredients can be used to make illegal drugs.""
Lady: ""Like what?""
Me: ""Meth.""
Lady: ""I don't make meth. Can I have it now please?""
Me: ""No, I still need a drivers license.""
Then she asked for the manager. I got the pharmacist and she had nearly the exact same conversation with her. The lady ended up just leaving. To this day I still think she was screwing with us.

5. My favorite story. There was a doctor in the area that had a couple of his prescription pads nicked. All the pharmacies were on alert and he had already agreed to call in any prescriptions until he could get new pads made. Well a couple comes in (and not to judge but they were the rattiest, dirtiest, couple I had ever seen. I mean they actually had dirt on them and smelled like they hadn't bathed in weeks.) and gives me a prescription for a Class 1 Controlled Substance I had never seen filled in my 3 years of working there. We always had a bottle stocked but I never saw us actually fill a prescription for it. This was my first red flag. Then I get to the doctors name and it's just a scribble (not really uncommon), so I go to the typewritten section and realize it's for the doctor that had his prescription pads stolen. I tell them I'm sorry but I can't fill the prescription. I don't give them a reason why. (I hadn't thought this through yet.) So they say okay and instead of leaving pull out a second prescription but for a simple Class 3 Controlled Drug. This time I just take the prescription, smile and say I'll call you when it's ready. Instead I called the cops. 

6. Finally, my last story which shows that sometimes it's not the customer that is the jerk. It's a pharmacy. We sell Plan B. If you are over 18 you do not need a prescription. So I'm working prescription drop off, the pharmacist is mixing up a compound, and my least favorite coworker is working prescription pick up. It's late so it is just the three of us, and I had no customers so I'm just filling the next days orders when a lady walks up to the pick up area. She is a good 30 feet away and very quiet so I can't really hear what she says. Apparently my coworker couldn't hear her either b/c she goes ""What?"" The customer speaks up and all I hear is Plan B. I know my coworker hates all birth control, but what she does next is mortifying. 
Lady: mumble mumble ""Plan B"" mumble mumble
Coworker: ""Oh."" She looks at me, and opens her mouth. 
Me (thinking): ""Don't you dare do it. Don't you dare.""
Coworker (yelling): ""This lady wants some Plan B. Will you take care of it? I won't fill a baby killing drug.""
There is a loud clanging as the pharmacist drops her pestle, the customer begins to cry, and I am just standing there jaw open. 

The pharmacist could not control herself. She yells my coworkers name and brings her into the back room. I take care of the crying customer and get her a gift card that more than pays for the Plan B. I apologize profusely, and she leaves no longer crying but obviously upset. 

My coworker comes out upset and angry, but she returns to her job. About 40 minutes later I'm off for the night so I clock out. I walk from behind the counter to pick up look at my coworker and go ""I need to pick up a prescription. *pause* It's my birth control."" It's not Plan B, but she hates it too. She turns red, looks at the pharmacist who goes ""nope"", and then gets me my prescription. That was her last week. ",Pharmacy Stories,139

Ladies, gentleman, ambiguous space beings, we deal with the public every day (except for me today because I somehow managed to get a weekend off. I... I had forgotten what a Saturday was) and every day there is at least one person who asks a REALLY dumb question. How we keep our faces straight, I'm not sure.

What are your favorite dumb questions? Here's a few of mine:

Note: I work in a women's business-casual clothing store

- ""Do you have black pants?"" (Said after she passed a giant wall of nothing but black pants)

- ""What's 40% off?"" 
""Everything!""
""So jewelry?""
""Yup! Everything is 40% off!""
""What about this sweater?""
""Yup. Everything. Is. 40% off.""
""What about your denim?""
(this conversation, unbelievably, kept going)

- ""Do you have denim corduroy pants?"" (Uhm...what?)

- ""Do you have a tailor on staff?""

- ""If I try to shrink this and it shrinks too much, can I return it?""

- ""If I wait to return these shorts until next summer, will I get a full price refund for them?""

- ""So...how do I tell what the sizes are?"" (cue me pointing out the size rage, the size label stamped into the clothing, and the size sticker)

 - ""Can I use a coupon on my credit card bill?""

-  ""How do I know what's on sale?""
""Anything on promotion will have a sign with it.""
""So, this sweater?""
""No, unfortunately not this one, but these tops over here are on promotion, just look for the white and red sign.""
""Oh... How about this jacket?""
""No. Just. The. Signed. Items.""

- ""Can yo just give me $15, I didn't find anything I want to use my $15 coupon on and it expires tomorrow, so can you just give me the $15?""

I guarantee you that there are more, but I could probably go on for hours. So share yours and let us all have a good laugh!",What are your favorite dumb questions?,131
Stuck_In_Purgatory,7,25,1quu03,106,"I work in a fish and chip shop in Australia. It's a great job and I love it. Last night, I had a couple interesting encounters and thought I'd share them with you!

There's a group of young boys ranging from about 10 to 13 that hang around the shop sometimes. Yesterday, 2 of them came in and sat on the chairs and waited. My boss (who is Greek and doesn't have the best English) asked what they were waiting for. The older one says ""oh we ordered $5 chips and 2 potato cakes.""
I laughed and told them ""we don't have any orders for that.""
Their response? ""well that didn't work.""  So they got up and left. I was both annoyed and amused. Amused that they thought we were that stupid, and annoyed that they were so rude to try scam food off us. 

A little while later there was a few more of them. 5 total. The youngest one walks into the shop, looks at our lollies, and walks out. Bit of info: we have a container of lollies in front of the register for paying customers to eat. Now these kids had no intention of buying anything, so when the kid walked out my boss's son said quick grab the lollies! So I took them to the back right as they walked back in. 
Kids: ""aww where's the lollies?""
Me: ""I took them to fill them up.""
The kids seemed happy about that, thinking they'd have even more lollies to take, until I said:
""except you don't get any, because you haven't bought anything."" and I walked off. All the other workers kinda laughed that I'd be so mean but they definitely deserved it. 
Boss's son talked to them for a tiny bit but they realized they couldn't scam free shit off us, so they left. 

I can't believe that kids these days are so rude and disrespectful. Which is why I don't take their shit.

A little later, a guy and his girlfriend ordered food. Once it was ready they decided to buy drinks and a sauce. The total came to $5.10

Remember how I said I'm in Australia? Our smallest coin is 5c. And no one tips except to say oh keep the 10c (or whatever) change. 

The guy pulls out two $5 dollar notes. I hand him one back and tell him not to worry about the ten cents. He hands it back to me and says, ""keep the change.""
I asked him if he was sure he wanted to give me $4.90 change to keep and he said yes. So I thanked him and told him to have a good night.
I went abd told my boss and she said ""that's the biggest tip we've ever had!"" I told her, ""well it makes up for all those 10c we tell people not to worry about.""

I guess it really does come back around :)",Good customers and bad customers.,131
littlewoolie,8,23,1r6hc9,114,"I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager (N) instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shop.

This was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady (A)who used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer (EC).

A was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stock.

EC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery (why people can't keep clothes neat while shopping, I'll never know).

*Our shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag.* 
A does this for EC.

A: Your total purchase is $xx

During this whole process, EC has been talking non-stop on the phone about various bullshit.

EC: Be quiet, I'm on the phone!

A remains silent and, in the meantime, more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking. Everyone else starts to look annoyed at EC.

After about 5 minutes, EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phone.

A: Your total is $xx

EC: You shouldn't interrupt people when they're on the phone.

A: I'm sorry, but I have other people waiting behind you. Some of them could be in a hurry.

EC *loudly*: It doesn't matter about them, **I** was here first.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

To me, it was relief to know that I didn't have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents, parents yelling at their kids, finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hook-ups (in a religiously associated charity shop, no less) and actually being able to enjoy the store's music (we got to pick our own radio station/CDs to listen to)",Mobile Phone policy,137
Foliagus,25,26,1r761t,113,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.

chesterfeildsofa,29,18,1qvy3h,104,"I worked 3rd shift at a grocery store for around 6 months, and I would start at 10pm, get my lunch at 2am, and get off at 6am. For my 2am lunch, the assistant manager(AM) would have to come up and run the register the 30 minutes i was gone, as well as close out the register for that day. It was probably worded different, but at 2am the computers would freeze and not let you scan anything until you did the end of day stuff. 

I can only remember one extreme coupon incident. I think maybe twice a year the store would have triple coupon days, where any coupon under $.99 would automatically be tripled. 

This lady came in around 1am and got to my register around 1:45am. She had a TON of coupons and a lot of duplicate items. I finished scanning all of her items and had started scanning the coupons around 2:15am. So of course the computer would freeze right then. The AM tried to fix it, but it said nothing could continue without doing the end of day, which would also void the entire transaction. A line had started to form behind the lady, so the AM said he would rescan all of her items on a different register while I took the other people behind her.....only my computer wouldn't work until he did the end of day stuff. So I am standing there, looking like an idiot, while he tries to get this lady out of the store. Then HIS computer freezes. I don't know what happened after that because he told me to go to lunch, and he would take all the other customers on his register. This whole situation was confusing as fuck because he was so frustrated and wouldn't explain anything he was doing to me.

I came back 30min later and he tells me he got her taken care of, and she got $300 dollars worth of stuff free, and he even had to give her money from the register when he was done. I thought that was probably a huge mistake, but whatever, it's on him not me.

The next night I come in and the General Manager asked me what had happened, so I told him the story of the previous night. Turns out the triple coupon deal was only to be applied to the first 3 coupons for a certain item, then just the regular coupon after that. No one had told us this before they left the previous day, so we didn't get in trouble for it.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

I decided to call it a day after I discovered my tie was soaked, too.","The Day of the Dentist, or why you shouldn't do what I did.",117

One night one of the groomers comes up to the registers and tells the cashier to expect a $70 dog brush to be returned without a receipt.

I stand at the register bullshitting with the cashier until as expected a lady comes in holding the $70 brush. Not to profile or anything, but she was dressed like a junkie.

so0ks,14,24,1qwp4i,99,"Yesterday, Illinois had some pretty bad weather blow through as well as tornados. I live and work in Chicagoland. It's about noon when we're looking out the windows of the local burger joint I work at. Our food is made to order, so we always park cars at the drive thru. This was not happening today. The winds were howling. The clouds were rolling over and swirling around, and the sky rapidly darkened. Every now and then, lightning would streak across the clouds. In the morning, we got a few sudden hits of torrential downpour. The FSM literally dumped the entire water content of His pot on us when He went to strain His pasta. There is a huge sloping ditch next to our parking lit, and it became a miniature lake by around noon time.

We got a call from one of the owners, and we all stopped doing what we were doing. NOPE. She wants us to stay open. Areyoufuckingkiddingme.

So we had to take orders at the window since it was impossible to hear anything but wind at the speaker, and since we were not parking, only one order at a time was going out. People were getting impatient and we had a few drive off from the drive thru line. By half past noon, nobody was outside, and the few customers we had in the dining room didn't want to leave. Which was totally fine and understandable. Especially when the tornado sirens started going off.

The clouds a few miles out that we were watching from the window looked like they were trying to form. We start trying to gather up the two families left to shepherd them into the bathroom, when I hear my headset beep. I look over at the other cook who was manning drive with me. She goes to answer it, and the guy starts trying to yell over the sirens his order.

Dude. Get the fuck out of your car and come inside.

He eventually gives up trying at the speaker box while my coworker was trying to get him to just get inside. He pulls up at the window and actually honks at us.

The sirens didn't last long, and nothing touched down by me yesterday. The winds and rain were brutal though. About an hour after the sirens went off, the sun broke through the clouds for about an hour before we were hit again with torrential rains. The winds never stopped.

Bears won though. BEAR DOWN!

PWND_U_IN_MK,47,23,1qw874,92,"Wall of text incoming...3...2...1...GO!

So I work at a retail pharmacy/convenience store. I don't work within the pharmacy, but I work at the front end of the store, where I am one of the managers. Although it's not entirely significant to this story, I'll let you know that the front end is open 8am-10pm 7 days a week, while the pharmacy is open 9am-9pm weekdays, and 9am-6pm weekends. On with the show.

So the night before last I had two very drugged out 20 somethings come into my store. They were both wearing jogging pants and jogging jackets with zippers. His was grey, dirty, and far too baggy for him causing the pants to droop. Hers was black and probably the right size, but her jacket was zipped open to reveal a t-shirt that was many sized too small leaving 4 inches of flabby midriff exposed. Both of them were as pale as ghosts and have the telltale facial marks of meth addiction.

They come straight up to the counter and ask if the pharmacy is open. I assure them, that as it is 8 pm on a sunday it is not open at this time. The male asks if there is another pharmacy nearby that would be open. I tell him that I don't know off hand but that I can check our system to see. I go into the office, and see that there is a 24 hour store just a few miles away form us.

I return to the male who is at the front counter and ask him if he is walking or driving. He looks at me, puzzled for a second, as if to say, ""Where am I  going?"" His drugged out train of though reminds him that he asked about the pharmacy, and he replies ""driving."" I tell him that there is a 24 hour store less than 3 miles from here. I offer him the address, and he loses concentration for a moment. He then asks me if I know any of our nearby competitor/s pharmacy hours.  I do not.

His initial reason for needing a 24 hour pharmacy was that we are the only ones that take his insurance. Now he is rambling that he will check the competitors to see if they take his insurance. At this point he runs off into an aisle to meet his woman. 

I tell my cashier to find them, and watch them like hawks, while I man the register. He nods in agreement and makes his way over to them.

The man and woman have a very loud expletive filled conversation with one another about what they should get. The man comes to the front to get cigarettes. I'm worried that the drug use has artificially aged him, so I ask for his ID. He doesn't have it. He yells down the aisle for the woman to bring her ID to the front. She yells that she doesn't have hers with her. He asks me if a passport will be okay, and I oblige him.

He tells me, and this is important, that his passport is in the truck. So I set the cigarettes to the side and help other customer while he runs out to get it. 

He comes back, the passport shows him born in 1991, which makes him old enough. I ring up the cigarettes again and tell him the total. He tells me that the woman has the money, and runs off to bring her to the front. She loudly exclaims that she obviously wants to buy everything once, and that the cigarette purchase will have to wait.

I call my cashier back to the front, as I have to leave the front to help a real customer.

Fast forward a bit, and they are at the front with Milk, ice cream, and cookies, much less than the woman seemed to be carrying around. They ask if we can check the balance of their food stamps card, my cashier tells them we cannot, and so they stand at the front counter and call the phone number on the back of the card to check their balance.

I manage to ring out most of the line of customers forming behind them. The whole time the guy is loudly complaining about how they cut stamps benefits for everyone, using lots of colorful language. He keeps telling my cashier that they were only supposed to cut it $20-$30 but him and a buddy of his went down $120. Oddly enough none of our other multitude of food-stamp customers have mentioned this.

Finally they find out that there is around $5 dollars on the card, they swipe it to pay, but obviously it's not enough to cover the food in the transaction, so it is declined. I tell them any my cashier that if they don't have enough to cover the full amount on the card, that he must enter the exact amount they wish to use, and then the rest can be paid separately. At this point they decide not to buy the food, and to instead just buy the cigarettes with cash.

All is well, except that the woman's fairly large canvas bag purse seems much fuller than when she walked in. The walk through the doors and the shoplifting alarm goes off, myself and my stocker immediately head over to stop them.

The man immediately exclaims that the alarm went off because of him. It didn't, it obviously went off when the woman's purse went through. I tell the woman I need to see in her purse, as it is what set off the alarm. She holds it up and sticks her face in it. She exclaims nothing is in it except for her stuff.

I grab the purse to look inside of it, and she grabs it back and screams at me. She exclaims that it is her personal purse and you go lookin' in peoples personal bags.

Her and the boy friend bolt out the door. Myself and my stocker follow them out. I tell them that I am calling the police and begin placing the call on my phone. At this point I could grab her bag from her, but I don't I have health insurance and I'm not getting into a fight with two druggies.

This is the fun part, the girl is screaming to the guy to get into the truck. It's a black ford explorer, that my stocker is writing down the license plate of.

The man starts saying ""We didn't bring the truck. This isn't my truck. We don't have a truck.""

The woman after a minute or so decides she has had enough, and begins walking away in tears. 

The man shrugs and gets in the truck finally and pulls out of the parking lot.

The woman runs around the other side of the car and jumps in, and they speed off into the night.

The police arrived a few minutes later and we file a report, complete with the tag number of the truck.

vegasyndrome,23,37,1qulv3,94,"I work at a baby store. Recently we had a sales associate ring through a hefty order last week. She made a couple of mistakes while ringing through this customer (the expecting grandparents). She accidentally discounted too many items on this invoice. One of my managers noticed this and pointed out that we didn't break even (around 5%). 

The expecting mother calls us a couple of days later and pointed out we didn't discount a couple of items on her receipt. We explained why we didn't (long winded but valid) and I was told she said ""I guess you don't want our business then."" 

I don't get that. Most of our products don't have a margin greater than 40% especially the bigger ticketed items. We gave this customer's parents around 45% off their whole order. We lost money.

KGBsurveillancevan,6,20,1qs00e,93,"Earlier this year, I worked for a franchise that bought and sold used clothes. I only worked there for three months total, but one of the regulars that I started recognizing was a tall, gorgeous redhead in her late 20s or early 30s. She was always really nice to the staff, and just casually flirted with the guys on staff, including myself. One of the most charming people I've met, and by far my favorite customer. Everything about her was just relaxed, energetic and carefree, even though none of my coworkers knew anything about her.

The last time I saw her was during my last week of work, two weeks before I moved to another state. She was in the store with what I presumed to be her boyfriend. She chatted with my manager briefly, just asking him to open a fitting room for her. He did, and then walked over to me. ""Dude. She just said the craziest thing to me. I'll tell you on break.""

She finishes trying everything on, we check her out, and she leaves. When I go on break, my manager comes back to the break room, and I ask him what it was she said that got him so freaked out.

BadgerSixTwo,9,15,1qrroa,92,"I work in tourism and my job is primarily to sell tickets for various length excursions. I also have certification to operate the equipment so I work out on the trips as well. About a year and a some months back, the trip was shortened due to flood damage and I was working the trip.

At the end of the trip, we all stand by the exit and wish people a good day. There are four workers on this trip consisting of me doing ground work, N doing narration, W the old conductor, and E the engineer.

The trip unloads front to back and the last two groups are a mother-daughter (MD) pair about 80 and 50 years old, respectively, and a family of four. As the MD pair are leaving, they see my orange vest and stop to complain about the family causing too much noise and how it ruined their trip and they wanted a refund. I apologized and said they could talk to the manager (J) inside where they picked up their tickets. They complain for another minute or so and start to move on (slowly though, the mom has a walker).

The family is behind them and aren't even listening to them. They seem normal and during the whole trip they were no louder than every other child on any of our excursions. Also, at no point during the trip did the pair complain. I also say they both complained when it was actually just the daughter.

They get about ten feet and stop at N and complain to him as well. He heard me and gave them the same instructions to see J. Meanwhile the children are getting bored because two old women aren't moving, so they busy themselves with patty cake. The daughter (D) hears this and loses it.

D: SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP! THE WHOLE TRIP YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT LOUD AND RUDE AND IF YOU WERE MY CHILD I WOULD PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE!

The parents move in to protect their children. N draws the pair's attention to him and I take the family out the second exit at the back, profusely apologizing for their behavior and assuring them their kids were fine the whole trip and the pair were being unreasonable in their expectations of children.

After this I stand at the main exit and wait for them to leave. They finish with N, mad that someone let the family off before them. Next in line is E.

E is an older man who has that sort of pissed off look at all times. He can be a pretty nice guy though. That being said, he doesn't take anything from anyone and will be up front  about it.

D: We just wanted to comp-

E: I don't want to hear it.

D: But-

E: Leave.

They climb down the steps and turn to me, the only person with an orange vest. She starts complaining again instead of focusing on her elderly mother trying to climb down the steps. I tell her I heard her complain already and I would take her straight to J. She still complains to me anyway and her mom almost falls because of her inattention.

As we walk in she spots W the conductor and goes to complain to him. W is a sweet, friendly guy, but he doesn't know how to handle complaints that well. I tell her he's not J and I will take them to J.

We get inside and they spot N moving snacks from the trip back inside for the day and try to stop him to complain. He din't stop and just said ""I'm busy right now."" D shouted that he was rude but he kept going.

They finally get to J. They complain to him and I tell him my side out of the pair's earshot. He denies them a refund because 1. no refunds anyway and 2. they didn't have a valid reason. D flipped out again how we were all unprofessional and we cheated her out of her money and we were going to go under if we didn't change our ways and how dare we refuse them a refund, didn't we know who they were, etc.

Captain-TomTom,48,31,1qrots,91,"Have you seen those shirts with the above mentioned title name? ""I love my church."" ?

I see them all the time where I work. Ah, the joys of working in retail. No I'm joking. Anyone with a few amount of brain cells would know there is little to no joy in retail.

Now about this shirt. I work in an art store. We cater to the creative crowds. Usually our customers range from teachers, to soccer moms, to christian educators of the like. They flock to our stores each Friday, Saturday and especially Sunday when the new sale starts up.

These customers are 80% more likely to wear this shirt ""I love my church."" You'd think they'd be our most understanding and nicest customers. The model christian that everyone aspires to be (Or believe they are.) Yeah I thought that too for a while.

You see these people are something different. Outwardly they wear a smile that seems as if they are a friendly and kindhearted individual. However, if you were to look deep into their eyes. I swear to you, they are not human. They are something else. Something evil...

This one customer changed my entire view on this shirt. But its just a shirt Captain TomTom, it can't be that bad. Oh, but it is. Oh, but it is...

I had the pleasure of cashiering a sunday afternoon right after the churches let their sheep out of their sermons. (I call them wolves in sheeps clothing. Thats what they are.) Most of them wear this shirt I keep bring up. So did this customer who I'm finally starting to tell you about.

I knew she was trouble when she walked in. (Our store likes to play this song over and over on the PA system. Even during chistmas time.) In tow she had 3 kids who immediately left her side and went running through the store. I greeted her from the registers and she smiled and was mumbling about something to herself and continued on her way. Not before I glimpsed at her shirt: ""I love my church."" I was naive to the plight of retailers at the time. I did not know what was in store for me.

Roughly about 13 minutes later she comes to the front of the store with a shopping cart full of random items. Yarn, popsicle sticks, glue, construction paper... all kinds of stuff. She still had that smile on her face. The kids were following her and had candy and other crap that crafty kids like within their grubby little hands. I cleared my throat and began. ""Thank you for shopping at -----'s I can check you out here.""

She motions her 3 kids to come along. The 3 kids immediately started to pile up things on the register making it hard to keep things organized. The mother of the three dug into her purse and pulled out several coupons. That was the second omen. Our store has a strict coupon policy. One coupon per customers, per day. We can't bend the rules at all for anyone no matter who they are, what they do, who they are affiliated with. In bold print it clearly states our coupon policy on each and every coupon. It also states it on the registers. On the walls when you first enter the building. In the bathrooms. But these signs seem to get ignored.

She hands the coupons over to me. They were all the same ones. 40% off one regular priced item. ""I'm sorry ma'am. You can only use one coup---""

Before I finished she smiled and said. ""Ok."" I smiled back thinking she understood. She kept mumbling and talking. Then I realized she had a bluetooth earpiece in her ear. Apparently holding a conversation with someone on the other end. That was the third omen. I was clearly a deer in headlights. I proceeded with the transaction, scanning and bagging each item. When I was picking though some of the things piled up on the registers. I touched something wet... and slimy. One of those nasty little kids opened a sucker and licked it and put it in the pile of items on the counter. Immediately I recoiled and investigated what it was I touched.

I gagged a bit as the drool trailed from my fingers to the sucker. I quickly regained my composure and wiped my hands on my apron. (someone stole the napkins from my register along with the hand sanitizer that day.) I looked at her seeing if she was going to apologize as she was staring at me. No, she was carrying on her conversation in that earpiece. The kids looked at me and just laughed. Those little laughs haunt me till this day. It was just innocent child laughter. It was off, it was like they plotted to do that. I could be paranoid but those laughs tell me other wise.

After bagging several items,  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She was going to pay and leave with her little monsters. She dug in her purse again and pulled out the coupons. I stared at her baffled for a moment seeing that she understood that she couldn't use those coupons. ""You forgot my coupons."" She smiled again.

""I'm sorry Ma'am but our coupon policy only limits one coupon per cust----."" She cut me off again.

""Yeah I know. Can we just split the transactions or something and I can pay it several times?"" She started to wag the coupons impatiently. 

""No ma'am I can't do that all. It wouldn't be fair to the oth---."" To my absolute horror her eyes narrowed as if I shot her in the heart. Her face went from a fake smile to a completely menacing bitch from the 6th level of hell. 

""I don't see why you even have coupons all the time if you can't use them at all. What kidn of place is this?! I thought this place was for creative people. All you people want to do is take money. How about giving for a change."" She continued on and on. I almost blacked out for a moment. Literally spit was flying out of her mouth and hit my glasses. 

""I--- Well our coupon pol---."" Again she cuts me off on queue. 

""I don't care about the coupon policy. You know what?! I don't want any of this! Come on lets go."" She motioned for her brats to follow suit. I thought it was over as she started to make her way to the exit. No. No it wasn't over. Right when I started to move the cart of bagged items out of the walkway for the next customer. She comes back again. ""This place is the devil! You are just a follower! Coming to work and trying to swindle hard working Christian people like me out of their money. I answer to a higher power!."" It scares me how I remember some of the things she had said word for word. But I do remember clearly that shirt she was wearing and the final thing she said to me. ""I pray for you. Because you need it.""

Needless to say. All the shouting drew attention to the check out lines. Customers and other employees stood and watched  . No one said a word. However Taylor Swift once again blared over the PA system ""Trouble trouble trouble! Oh! OHHH! Trouble Trouble!"" Finally the event was over and she dragged herself out of the store. The other customers looked at me.

""I can... I can help the next customer in line."" I spoke with a shaking voice. I still didn't know what happened. Like I was in a  car accident and wasn't able to cope with the situation that had occurred. The next customer walked up and smiled. 

""I'm so sorry that woman was so irate with you! You poor thing! She wasn't really a christian woman now was she?"" The old lady was friendly and understanding. Until I noticed she was wearing the same shirt. My heart felt like it stopped. ""I have a couple of coupons to use."" she said.

kingtigerii,20,16,1r00fh,88,"Or ""How we just got skimmed by an EF-2 tornado and you want your pictures.""


Sunday we had some bad weather roll through the area and the cell moving our way was a tornado spawner. When the inevitable tornado sirens sounded I called a manager and let them know. The following is a round about as to what happened next:

**4:15pm:** Sirens sound for the county. manager called.

**4:30pm:** Store Director makes announcement that warning is in place. Tells customers to wait for second announcement in 5 minutes.

**4:35pm:** Announcement is made again that the Store Director suggests we take cover.

**4:36pm:** Manager suggests we unplug the photo kiosks to prevent electrical damage.

**4:37pm:** In the middle of the phone call with the manager, she yells ""OH GOD THE DOORS!"" and hangs up. At this time I hear a loud explosion type noise and rumbling. 

Instinct kicks in and I start screaming at people to get in the back cram as many people in the bathrooms as possible.

**4:40pm:** People are trying to calm the screaming cashiers and employees (The customers were super calm - go figure...) and I get paged over the intercom. It's the manager, and she sounds like she's shaken up badly. Wants me to watch my cell phone and radar.

**4:50pm:** Try calling employee who is in at 5pm. He's like a brother so I'm worried he was driving in. Texting mom and other coworker. Not sure of damage to store.

**4:55pm:** Getting sick of waiting in a hot and crowded bathroom with screaming cashiers, panic filled environment isn't helping my coworker so i take her out too. Radar says storm is passed. No contact with co-worker who is due in at 5pm.

*- Time line stops*

So I wander up to the front of the store to find that the roof is leaking in various spots, but no major damage is done like many were saying. Cashiers made it sound like the front of the store had collapsed, when in reality it had simply taken roof damage and the glass awnings on the front of the store were gone (later we found they had rolled atop the roof, causing the damage).

No sooner do I reach the front entrance when my buddy shows up laughing and soaking wet. We joked around about it, I explained what happened and we got to work roping off the middle of the store which was leaking badly (Burst pipe and holes in the roof over the clothing department).

As we are roping everything off and making sure nobody plays in the water, my phone rings. 

Now mind you, we have emergency only power, there are no registers open and the employees are thinking the management closed the store down until we can make sure nothing collapses or hurts anyone. Around the store, there are red phones that call an employee in the the department in which the phone is located.


It's a customer (C for short). Turns out we're still open...go figure.

**C** - ""Hi there is nobody back here and we want our pictures!""

**Me** - ""Ma'am, there is nobody to help you back there because all available employees are assisting in cleanup and funneling customers out of the store. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. I woul -""

The customer then hung up on me, and the phone rings again.

**C** - ""Hi, can somebody come back here and give me my pictures?""

**Me (attempting to do 12 things at once and make sure the dumb kid at my feet isn't playing in the possibly electrified water):** ""Ma'am, the roof is leaking. Nobody can help you, photo is closed. Please come back another day. Sorry, have a great night."" 

I hung up. Few minutes later a couple teens walked by and were griping about shitty service.



So my buddy and I get the department and most of the leaks roped off. Manager calls and wants us to caution tape the front of the store outside (where the glass awnings are missing, in case anything falls). I get cracking on that and avoid the reporter outside asking question on what happened.

Next crisis, we are still apparently open and need to close, so we need to get customers checked out and out of the store. I hop on lane and start with a transaction when the register looses power midway through. There goes part of the emergency power. Crap.

My buddy is still open on the lane he jumped on so I help him with a couponer (seriously, she had a book. Could have smacked her but we both kept smiling) and got the store cleared out. 

Signs get posted and we shut the doors. Clean up time.

Employees start grabbing shop-vacs off the shelves, squeegees and anything else that can help like mops and buckets. Others are pulling damaged product from the shelves and putting fallen things back up where they go.

It's about 9:30pm when we get another announcement, from another Store Director. The store is reopening at Midnight. It comes as a demoralizing blow because instead of working towards cleanup, we realize we are all simply here to reopen quick as possible and make the company more money. Most of the people on overtime started to leave because they just stopped caring. I decided to stay until my buddy left, couldn't leave him alone with the mess.

Normal cleanup until around 10:30pm, when the Store Director from the previous announcement announces that we are now open for business. My buddy and I look at each other and the still massive pool of water on the ground and decide we've had enough. We pick up our mess and tell the nearest manager we're leaving. I've got two hours of overtime and my buddy has an 8am class. She tells us to put some stuff back really quick and get out. By the time this was completed it was 11pm. We were tired, wet and hungry.

Apparently the EF-2 ""skipped"" over the store, causing only minor damage compared to the industrial complex it wrecked prior to the store and the houses and drive-in movie theater that were leveled after the store. Thankfully it also missed the two hospitals that are next to the store.


**TL:DR: Met a man made of tin, scarecrow and a talking lion and we skipped down a brick road to meet a wizard.**

talesfromesalesthrow,12,22,1r6n0m,92,"Apologies for the length. I just needed this out of my system. Since I've only experienced support on this sub, I need to get this out there. 

Also, this is a story on the OTHER side of retail: The boss/employee relationship.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

Queue Asshole-Negger. Let's call him A.N. for short. 
A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking."" 



Label that with a big NOPE.JPG and send it off to the printers!

GrimGuy,29,15,1r0zg2,90,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

bekahbbydoll,24,15,1qqw6j,89,"I would like to take this time to praise my front end manager. I came in an hour late because of a miscommunication with another manager. The phone call I received was anything but nice and professional, but I'm not here to talk about that. 

So after I came in I didn't let my foul mood try to get in the way of doing my job, I was super polite to guests and professional. My front end manager could tell something was up though. She asked what was wrong and I told her. She apologized profusely and told me that she was so sorry that it happened. 

Fast forward about 4 hours. A guest brought in some boots that she bought online. She didn't like that they had a colored zipper on the back. She bought them for like 35 bucks. When she returned them the price got reduced to $8.07. The boots were my size and I was dying to have them. I had mentioned this to my front end manager. But then realized that I didn't have enough cash on me to be able to use my team member discount. 

I was a little bummed. I knew someone else would snatch them up in no time because of the killer savings. My manager asked why I wasn't going to buy them and I told her I just didn't have the money to. Even though they were super cheap. So i go on break a little bummed.

I come back from break and my manager is holding a bag out to me. I asked her if it was a paid and left and she shook her head. I looked at her quizzically. She nods her head down at the bag and says 'look inside.' I open the bag and low and behold it's the boots! I look up at her and I'm just in awe. She told me it was no big deal, she knew I was having a bad day and that I really wanted the boots. I just had to promise that I would wear them tomorrow. I practically ran around the counter to hug her. It was the nicest thing anyone that I work with has ever done for me. I seriously almost started crying.

Vasite,9,23,1qzps2,81,"Background: I work in a retail store that has fairly small (in my opinion) pillars around the store to hold it up for support. Well to make it look nicer we have put glass mirrors on the 4 sides of the square pillar. Now i have seen these glass pillars chipped before. It doesn't look like your average fragile glass this stuff looks thick and tough to probably avoid easy damage. 

Story: I'm usually a PoS (register/customer service) employee so i'm rarely on the floor. Well today i was needed on the floor due to some call outs. I'm speaking with a customer about some men's shirts and clearance items pretty close to our shoes department.

~Note we wear little headsets on the floor to communicate to each other for various things

Over my headset i hear that a small child has cut himself on glass in the shoe department and i say i'd run over and help since i was really close.  As i'm walking over i can hear a bloody scream coming from the department and i got to thinking. 

""wait a minute, glass, we don't have glass anywhere in shoes. What could he have possibly cut himself on?"" 

I finally get there and oh my god, there's blood everywhere. I can clearly see where the kid has been and what happened. There is a blood puddle right on/next to the glass pillar. I quickly get to the child being held by his mother, trying to close the 1-1/2 inch gash on his forehead. I quickly run off to the backroom for band aids/wipes/ whatever i could find. It wasn't much sadly. 

By this time the parents aren't really saying anything but to help them while calming down the child, I'm not really thinking much of it because the amount of blood all over the department. The manager and some other associates have managed to get over there by now and were taking him to the restroom to clean him up.

Now that the kid (still screaming) have went to the restroom i page the cleaning lady to help me get the blood out of everything. Now i can get a good look and what may have happened. Our glass pillar in the shoe department is wedged in between 2 giant shelves of shoes. There is maybe 2 inchs of space between the pillar and shelf, no enough room for anybody to move through. The pillar has been chipped so i inform the manager that the child may have glass in the wound so the parents would know. 

Then a lady grabs my attention, asking to tell me something:

Lady: Ms. Vasite? (i have a nametag on)

Me: yeah? what can i do for you?

Lady: That little boy was sprinting all throughout the shoes, i asked the parents to watch him but they didn't care, and he ran right into the pillar. I saw the whole thing.

Me: thank you, i'll inform the manager. 

Now by this time i'm used to the fact parents let their kids run wild in the store and maybe this will teach them they need to watch him more. I head back to the restroom to wash off anything i may have gotten on my hands and see the parents signing, again SIGNING a form saying we, the store, are not at fault for this accident. They leave soon after and i was just chatting to the manager about what the women had said and i went on with my day

Now here's the funny part. I come into work the next day to find out that the parents are ""trying"" to sue us for their son's head wound. On the grounds of ""The pillar shouldn't have been there"" Really? What else are we suppose do with a support beam for the building? Lord.",It's the stores fault that pillar is there.,104
Senoritallama,17,17,1qwrd6,82,"Saturday nights get pretty busy and on Saturday nights I usually work drive-thu. We get so busy the line of cars is wrapped around the building and sometimes out to the street. So me and who ever is in drive-thru try to get the line moving as fast as we can without being rude to the customers because usually people get pretty pissy about waiting in such a long line and I don't blame them.
Last Saturday night we got pretty busy. I was taking money at the window and my friend was taking the orders and we had someone running them. 
The next order came up that was a double-cheeseburger basket and a large drink was exactly $10. An older man pulls up to the window and I say,""Hello, sir. Your total is $10.""
The man doesn't say anything and just reaches in his pocket and pulls out a handful of change and dumps it on the ledge and says, ""Count it out."" 
I stood there for a full 30 seconds in shock.
I start counting it out and it's not nearly enough. He gave me $4.36. I open the window and say, ""Sir, I still need $5.64.""
He doesn't say anything to me just mumbles to himself how stupid I am that I can't count. He pulls out his wallet and throws me a $10 bill. I put it in my draw and hand the food to him.

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16.  Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure.  He wants desperately to be cool. He’s got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid …

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid’s church bow tie and his wife’s apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I’m bagging groceries. It’s Labor Day, so I’m constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

“Hey, are you unmined?”

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She’s my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

“Yeah?” Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and “yeah” is all I can manage.

“I’m Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].”

“That’s cool.” I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I’ve known since elementary school.
“You working all day today?”

“Yeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.”

“Bummer. We’re having a pool party. You could have come.”

Now I’m really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I’m here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I’m totally scared of talking to girls.

“I wish I could. I hope you’re having a good time.”

“It’s good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.”

“Well, maybe we can do something next week.” Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

“Totally. You have a pen?”

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I’m both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy’s Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

“Call me. We’ll set something up.”

“Great, thanks!”

“See you later!” She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it’s all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I’m feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I’m so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom’s stash (don’t do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she’s just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said “I’m bummed. This went by took quickly.”

“It has,” I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR … next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I’d give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it’s indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I’ll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","”Bag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2” or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",133

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

'Donna' has been working at this store for ~8 years.  Huge inflated ego, talks to everyone like they're 5, and stupid (she was a school teacher), basically has piss-poor customer service skills and a non-existent work ethic.

Most people have said ""I bet you're made up!"" But really, no, I like my late shifts.

OW: it's out of fucking date. You can't sell out of date chickens!! You fucking idiot. 
(*sigh* mountains out of molehills) 
Me: the cook in the bag ones with stuffing? I should have another one here let me Che... Oh, I do, take your pick out of these ones. 
OW: the things you have to do around here to get service is a joke. 
Me: sorry, it's still early and nobody was on our department last night so everything's a bit of a mess right now
OW: well I used to own a supermarket. Asda. That was mine. I was the CEO. I know you can't sell out of date chickens. It's illegal. 
Me: cool. I'll go and dispose of it. Have a nice day, let me know if you need anything.

starfleetjedi,19,15,1qzs2c,73,"The bakery I work for does vegan goods, so now and then we get emails from earth-friendly citizens complaining about our use of palm oil. The emails usually sound the same:

&gt; ""I will no longer be purchasing your products until you stop using palm oil. And I will tell friends and family to boycott you as well!""

&gt; ""Here is a link to a video and pictures of orangutans being displaced and murdered in Indonesia because of palm oil.""

&gt; ""I demand that you remove your 'vegan' labeling because you are an evil company!""

Blah blah. Stfu.

We explained that it is temporary since the company we purchased our vegan butter changed their formula, which resulted in rancid baked goods. Rest assured that we are testing alternatives. All that jazz.

Anyway, we finally found a company to provide us with sustainable palm oil. No animals harmed during its manufacturing. Yay! We post this information on our Facebook page, our websites, and our Twitter.

The complaints have slowly stopped. However, weeks after that, we get an email from a woman who claimed that she is a lawyer from New York, and she happened to have our product for lunch and saw the list of ingredients. Being the environmentalist that she is, she thought she would complain about the palm oil.

With her email was a PDF attachment that contained her complaint, a scan of the product wrapper, and various links to anti-palm oil websites. All this effort must've taken her an hour or so.

I can practically hear this woman's whiny voice as I read her email. I can't take it. Usually, I'm supposed to apologize and tell them we have sustainable palm oil now, and if I could please have her address so I can send her free products.

Not this time. In the most curt way I could muster, I replied:

&gt; **Pls check our website.**

*SEND.* Not even going to sign it or bother spelling out that 'please'. I wanted to take it off, too.

Bearweather,2,13,1qq90l,76,"This story is a few years old, but nevertheless: 

A few years ago I had a weekend job as a supermarket cashier. I met quite a few characters over the years -the stoners were always amusing, herds of teens annoying, and the Sean Connery look-alike would always make me pause. But one lady tops them all as my most memorable customer. 

This little old lady comes up to my register and starts piling up tins and tins of cat food. I'm talking a lot of cat food, the good stuff also -the chunks and gravy variety.

Anyway as she's piling more and more cat food onto my register she pauses for a moment, looks at me dead in the eyes and says ""It's obvious I've got a pussy"".

Never in my life have I struggled so much to keep a straight face.",Old lady buys cat food.,89
wigglemaster,12,13,1r3pyj,76,"I just made my first post earlier tonight, and it must be the day for crazies because not even 15 minutes after the first encounter, this exchange happened:

A woman (from here on called LF for leatherface) came into the store (a contract postal unit) wanting to ship a couple of packages. I was processing each one, when she leans over the counter. 

LF: ""You know, you are very pretty!""

Me: ""Oh, Thank you!"" 

LF: ""I mean it. You are. You have beautiful hair.""

Me: ""Thanks, really."" At this point it's getting a little weird. She is leaning over the counter, getting way too into my personal space.

LF: ""Seriously. Your hair is pretty, but your skin! It's like peaches and cream. I would die for skin like yours.""

Me: ""....thanks...""

Here's where it gets INSANE: 

LF: ""I'd really like to just peel all your skin off and wear it myself.""

I'm sorry, what? I backed up, finishing her packages as quickly as possible. I could feel her beady eyes trained on me like lasers. I am sure she didn't mean it literally, but she had the crazy eyes and in a post office, you can't ever be too sure.",Mrs. Leatherface wants to make me into a skin suit,89

I’ve written before about being wholly unprepared for some of the “human elements” of being a manager. This is another case. Shit like this is just not covered in business school, but it should be. So I’ll lay it out, tell you what I did, and invite your comments in hopes it may help others.

“Enid” was a middle-aged woman who was hired to service accounts over the phones. I did not hire her, but I didn’t object. Her background suggested she’d be a good fit.

She breezed through training without issue. She was assigned a cubicle not far from my own cube.

It only took a few days on the”floor” before the crazy started.

Enid complained to her supervisor that insects where biting her. The bugs were living under her desk. It was making her work difficult.

Supervisor wait until Enid leaves for the day and does an inspection. He sees nothing. On his way out he dropped by and told me what was going on.

On the off chance there was an actual infestation, I put in a work order to have the area sprayed down over the weekend. Supervisor passed this along to Enid, and she seemed satisfied.

I should pause her to say that we tried to go way out of our way to make sure phone people were happy. Especially new hires. Even if there might be a touch of crazy. Once we hired someone and put her/him through training, we’ve spend close to $20,000 developing the person.

So Enid was going to get white glove treatment.

The weekend came and went. The whole area (not just her desk) was sprayed, vacuumed and dusted. Clean.

Within two hours of Monday’s shift, Enid was back at Supervisor’s desk. Bugs. Still there. She made it a point to show a calf full of bug bites to Supervisor (who did not need to see that).

We waited for Enid to go to lunch. Then we both crawled around looking for bugs. We even pulled up an outlet and inspected the raised-floor space for bugs.

No bugs.

We even asked her cube neighbors if they had any problems. Nope.

At this point, I conceded that we may be dealing with a hiring mistake.

Supervisor told Enid that we’ve inspected, sprayed, inspected again, and verified with others; there was nothing we could find. There was little he could think of doing to make the situation better.

She became really pissed-off and walked into my cube.

“I’m being eaten alive and nobody is doing a damn thing about it!”

“I’m sorry Enid. I’m sure you feel bad, but we can’t find anything, and we can’t do much beyond spraying. We’ve not able to find the source of what is biting you.”

“I can’t work in this kind of environment.”

Okay … I’ll try one other tactic. “Here’s what we can do. I’ll have you move to another desk. We have a few others open. I’ll make sure there are no insects before we move you. Just give me a couple hours.”

We found he another cube, and had our facilities manager confirm it was bug free. He also gave the area a light dusting of pesticide. We gave it an hour to air out and moved Enid into her new space.

Tuesday comes. Enid is back in my doorway. “They are still here! I can see them! They are tiny white bugs and they are still biting me. I’m going to the doctor.”

No objections to her leaving to seek medical help. I hoped that the doctor would give her some insight that I could use to resolve the matter. I also went looking for white bugs. No bugs.

Wednesday morning, Enid approaches Supervisor. She pulls her pants down just a bit, exposing a scabies-infected splotch at the top of her butt-cheek.

“I got scabies from working here!” she insisted. (Note, if you feel like throwing up today, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies).

I asked her to go see our occupational nurse. Off she went. The nurse calls an hour later.

“Did she tell you she has scabies?”

“Yup.” I said.

“There’s no chance she got it here. It’s transmitted from direct contact with an already infected person. Unless she’s sitting on someone’s lap, the odds of picking it up at a cube are tiny.”

“Okay. Is she coming back up?”

“She’s on her way.”

Enid appears a minute later.

“I don’t know what to do. I’m being eaten alive by a parasite and nobody wants to help.”

I give Enid a quick review of what we’ve done to mitigate the problem.

“So what’s next?” She asks.

“We can’t do anything else. We’ve done all we can to accommodate you. There is simply nothing left to be done. I’m sorry you’re having a rough time, but I have to ask you to return to your desk now and begin working.”

“Fine.”

From this point forward, she got no additional support on the issue. She bitched and moaned for a few more weeks, and then finally quit with a vague threat of impending lawsuits. We were never actually sued, and never heard from her again.
