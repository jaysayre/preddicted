Were you bullied at school and did it effect you?

Any events that you and your parents went too were there obvious funny looks from people that didn't know you?

Honestly did you wish you had a male and female parent?

Children with female parents, do you think you needed a male role model in the household? And vice versa

When you were going through puberty were there certain things happening that you felt awkward asking your parents about? i.e. Female child with 2 male parents having your first ""monthly visitor.""

From what I've read it seems to be all mainly positive with a few exceptions and your usual family bullshit.

*Also a point of clarification: It was not my intention to compare degrees of gruesome, as might have come across in one of my comments about crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer. I have lived through some pretty horrible stuff myself and seen and heard  even worse. Though I do agree that I shouldn't have described some crimes as ""worse"" than what Jeffery Dahmer did, just that I have heard enough to build some kind of immunity towards horrible crimes. I am still scared, but there is too much bad in this world that new things unfolding sometimes don't have that much of an adverse affect as they used to. Its a coping mechanism and I don't want to go into too much detail, but I felt like I should have clarified on this point.*","Cops, FBI Agents, and other law enforcement agents: what are some of the most gruesome crimes that you have witnessed?

speathed,24,16,1r2ufp,22,"Some context on this question. Yesterday's [What's your biggest ""I dodged a bullet"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qz709/whats_your_biggest_i_dodged_a_bullet_moment/) got me thinking of an incident that happened in my youth. Whilst perhaps not exactly 'dodging a bullet' at that precise moment, it brought back memories of when I met a monster. 

When I was about 14 my high school started a boys after school sports club. I lived out of town and had been home before so asked my father for a lift.

We arrived about 10 minutes late and the first thing that struck me was that all the boys were running about with no tops on. I headed for the changing rooms but wasn't too comfortable with the idea. It was definitely not the norm at my school for this.

After finally arriving at the changing rooms with my father, the man running the club followed us in. My father knew I wasn't comfortable with what appeared to be a very weird guy getting kids to run about half naked so he spoke to the man for a few minutes.  Shortly after he returned and told me to get ready, as we were leaving.

I'm not sure what was said in their exchange but my father was creeped out. He specifically told me not to attend the class as there was ""something not right"" with the guy running it. This didn't matter in the end as the class only ran once.

His name was [Thomas Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre) and about 8-10 months later he walked into another school about 40 miles away and shot dead sixteen young children and their teacher.","[Serious] Reddit, have any of you guys ever met a serial killer (or person who later committed a horrific act of atrocity) before they became 'infamous'.

trevics,75,14,1qypcj,16,"This has likely been asked several times in the past, but I'll ask again and start. 

I've done a lot of things I'm my life that I'm not proud of and have often times found myself in a tremendous funk because of it. 

I've owned a lot of animals in the past, but after a particularly dark period in my life I adopted a dog that literally saved my life and became my best friend. 

When I met my wife, she had two large dogs as well and after an initial getting to know you period they all became a good pack. 

One day, after we had all moved to a new state,  two of the dogs started fighting viciously but we were able to separate them.  The third time this happened the fight was so bad that our kitchen looked like a murder scene.  At one point as we struggled to pull them apart one had the other by the nose and punctured him near the eyes so that it was bubbling out. My wife ended up with a broken finger due to the ordeal. 

We loved those dogs like they were our children, but she said mine had to go. All of the shelters in LA were full, and he was so injured that I couldn't find anyone to take him. 

The vet reluctantly agreed to put him down,  but I was so distraught I couldn't be in the room with him for it. 

TLDR: I wasn't able to be there for the dog who saved my life and I regret it more than anything every day. ","Reddit, what is the one thing you most regret doing in your life?",30

I've been having a lot of issues as of a year or so when it comes to being a decent human being. I don't like people, at times I even despise them. The only people I like are gone or unavailable to me. Before things got like this, however, I was also a part of the herd doing stupid things without thinking of consequences. I hurt someone's feelings many years ago for no reason and never apologised for it. The guilt's been haunting me over this in particular (next to a wall of other things) for so long it's almost always on my mind, which is why I tend to keep busy in any way possible (gotten to the point where I'd rather do anything than think about the past).

Here's my issue - apologising would fix nothing in my opinion. She's better off without me and I'm not really a part of her life any more, only a past that's irrelevant. Opening up contact right now would do her no favours and I have no intention of causing her any more grief because she's a nice person, unlike me.

TL;DR: Obvious solution to guilt is asking for forgiveness, not an option available.

Abortion is a very controversial subject and we hear a lot about it from political pundits, religious people and people we know. And it's no surprise, either: it's a subject that brings up when life begins, when is a human legally considered a 'person' with rights, whether government intrusion is justified. But, with all the yelling and fighting that goes on between the pro-choice and pro-life sides, we often don't get to hear about it from the perspective of someone who's actually experienced it first-hand. Well, I - and many other people - want to hear that perspective!

I'm also hoping that this thread can help clear up the misconceptions that people often have about women who choose to terminate their pregnancy. Misconceptions like 'Women who get abortions are selfish', 'Women who get abortions don't give it any thought before they do it', and 'Women who get abortions just don't want to deal with the consequences of their actions'.


If you yourself haven't had an abortion, but your girlfriend/fiance/wife has, feel free to answer! Same for those of you who have a close friend or family member who's had an abortion. 

**Just please don't attack anyone for their own decisions or their opinion on abortion.** I want this to be a safe place where everyone feels comfortable opening up about their experiences and feelings.
