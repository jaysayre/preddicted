capntabasco,23,12,1rdkur,22,edit  several commenters have confused election fraud with voter fraud  voter fraud is rare and virtually never amounts to a significant number of improper votes  its usually one person trying to vote multiple times  election fraud is vote tampering by the people who have control over the voting process itself  voter fraud while illegal and wrong is statistically meaningless especially in a national election such as for President  election fraud on the other hand could very well allow a small group of people to change the outcome of a national election  the most insidious part of this is that if this happened in our current voting system we would probably never know it ,If we all voted online with anonymized IDs and those votes were then made public in a giant list to give us all a chance to confirm our vote as well as double check the tally wouldnt that eliminate most election fraud,34,AskReddit,49,45
