For those that are still reading this:

We can certainly see that there are many at-need children in this world. We also remember what it was like to get that favorite toy during the holidays. You may not be Santa, but you can still help! I implore you, please donate at least one toy to a cause. Could be some local charity or perhaps Toys for Tots. Also, most donations are for toddlers. Older kids have a tendency to be short changed in these drives. So, if you can, try to get something for the 6-15 year olds. I would strongly suggest something along the lines of science! Why not guide those young minds while you have a chance! A $10-25 gift can make a difference.

**EDIT 1: As someone pointed out, I left out military personnel in the title. Stories from military people are relevant to the topic, I just wasn't thinking**

**EDIT 3: Thanks, all those who responded! I really appreciate you taking the time.**

*Also a point of clarification: It was not my intention to compare degrees of gruesome, as might have come across in one of my comments about crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer. I have lived through some pretty horrible stuff myself and seen and heard  even worse. Though I do agree that I shouldn't have described some crimes as ""worse"" than what Jeffery Dahmer did, just that I have heard enough to build some kind of immunity towards horrible crimes. I am still scared, but there is too much bad in this world that new things unfolding sometimes don't have that much of an adverse affect as they used to.

I'm somebody who's got a great job in a field I love (technology), who's in decent shape, has a recovering sex-life and is in OK financial shape. However, I'm still largely dissatisfied with my life. 

I've always been lazy, but until now at the ripe old age of 29, it hasn't become a sufficiently big problem. At this stage of life, where I'm expected to start taking charge of life, I find that I'm unable to muster the motivation to do the things I want. 

- I want to get fitter, but I don't have the motivation/energy to go to the gym, run, etc.
- I want to make new friends, but going out and meeting people seems like too much work (I'm an introvert)
- I want to learn the guitar, but practising everyday seems like a chore
- Work is starting to get more and more boring, and I'm making few efforts to get better at my craft

You get the idea. I hate, hate, HATE the way I feel. I've tried many things to regain my motivation (meditation, breaking tasks into the smallest unit, trying to form simple positive habits), but nothing seems to stick. 

I feel like a potential failure (not yet, but if I stay like this, my life might deteriorate in the future). I often feel depressed (depression has been a constant companion most of my life). I feel helpless, lost and disappointed in myself.

voter fraud, while illegal and wrong, is statistically meaningless, especially in a national election such as for President.  election fraud on the other hand could very well allow a small group of people to change the outcome of a national election.  the most insidious part of this is that if this happened in our current voting system, we would probably never know it.

Yesterday's [What's your biggest ""I dodged a bullet"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qz709/whats_your_biggest_i_dodged_a_bullet_moment/) got me thinking of an incident that happened in my youth. Whilst perhaps not exactly 'dodging a bullet' at that precise moment, it brought back memories of when I met a monster. 

When I was about 14 my high school started a boys after school sports club. I lived out of town and had been home before so asked my father for a lift.

We arrived about 10 minutes late and the first thing that struck me was that all the boys were running about with no tops on. I headed for the changing rooms but wasn't too comfortable with the idea. It was definitely not the norm at my school for this.

After finally arriving at the changing rooms with my father, the man running the club followed us in. My father knew I wasn't comfortable with what appeared to be a very weird guy getting kids to run about half naked so he spoke to the man for a few minutes.  Shortly after he returned and told me to get ready, as we were leaving.

I'm not sure what was said in their exchange but my father was creeped out. He specifically told me not to attend the class as there was ""something not right"" with the guy running it. This didn't matter in the end as the class only ran once.

His name was [Thomas Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre) and about 8-10 months later he walked into another school about 40 miles away and shot dead sixteen young children and their teacher.","[Serious] Reddit, have any of you guys ever met a serial killer (or person who later committed a horrific act of atrocity) before they became 'infamous'.

So after recently reading through the thread about people's college degrees and where they are in life now, I got to thinking that a lot of those that were successful did so because they had their shit together. That, and the fact that not a lot of people ended up in their field of study, got me thinking...

What can I do as a 21 year old college student to really ensure I'm successful later down the road? 

I'm pretty unspectacular in every way. My list of achievements isn't very long, my grades aren't top percentile of the class (since high school, I've always hovered at just around 80-85% average in everything), I'm not extremely fit (though I do regularly go to the gym), and I don't have much work experience.

rocklobster955,26,,1,1rh5v3,,10,"I'm 23 but I know I drink way more than average. I have a great job and alcohol has never gotten in the way of that but I feel it may. I have a beautiful daughter and would do anything for her, including quitting or slowing down on alcohol. 

I probably drink daily/every other day and can finish a pint of liquor pretty quickly (3-4 hours). I never used to do this but since my last break up shit has gone kinda sour. She was my balance beam and now that I don't have that I turn to the bottle, even when I'm hanging out with friends. They don't notice nor have mentioned anything about it since they are all still in college. 

What works for the alcoholics here? I've been to AA but it was way to religion oriented for me. Are all the places like this or just the place I was?

I am 20 now. I plan to leave the city I live in with my family once I graduate college, and after that don't have much of a desire to maintain relationships with my siblings. Is it weird that I don't feel an innate sense of familial love? Does anyone else feel this way?
